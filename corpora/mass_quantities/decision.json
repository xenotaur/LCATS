    "body": "The battle alarm caught him in the middle of a dream, a dream that took\nplace in a white house in a small town in Ohio, when both he and Alice\nhad been very young and the grown adults he now called his children had\nreally been little more than babies.\n\nHe rolled out of his bed immediately on hearing the gong, as any good\nsailor would, and slipped into his pants and shoes and felt around the\nbulkhead for his life jacket. He slipped into it and tightened the\nbuckles, then put on his cap with the captain's insignia.\n\nHe opened the hatch and stepped out into the passageway, blinking for a\nmoment in the unaccustomed light and trying to shake away the remnants\nof his dream. Officers were boiling up the passageway and up the ladder,\nsome eager ensigns dressed only in their shorts and their life jackets.\nIt was more wise than funny, he thought slowly. Ships had gone down in a\nmatter of seconds and anybody who spent precious moments looking for his\npants or his wallet never got out.\n\nHarry Davis, the Exec, a portly man in his fifties, burst out of his\nstateroom, still trying to shake the sleep from gummy lids.\n\nThe Captain shook his head, trying to alert his mind to the point where\nit could make sensible evaluations, and started up the corridor.\n\n\"Any idea what it is, Harry?\"\n\nDavis shook his head. \"Not unless it's what we've been expecting.\"\n\nWhat we've been expecting. The Captain grasped the iron piping that\nserved for railings and jogged up the ladder. Fifty miles north, lolling\nin the North Sea and holding maneuvers, was the _Josef Dzugashvili_, a\nhundred thousand tons of the finest aircraft carrier the Asiatic Combine\nhad produced, carrying close to a hundred Mig-72's and perhaps half a\ndozen light bombers.\n\nThe _Josef_ had been operating there for nearly a week. The _Oahu_ had\nbeen detached from the Atlantic Fleet only a few days ago, to combat the\npossible threat. Maybe the ships were only acting as stake-outs for the\npoliticians, the Captain thought slowly. The tinder waiting for the\nspark. And it wouldn't take much.\n\nA curious pilot who might venture too close, a gunner with a nervous\ntemperament ...\n\nAnd now, maybe, this was it. It had to come some day. You couldn't turn\nthe other cheek forever. And he, for one, was glad. He had spent almost\nall his life waiting for this. A chance to get even ...\n\nDavis opened the hatch to the wheelhouse and the Captain slipped in,\nclosing it tight behind him. It was pitch black and it took his eyes a\nfew moments to adjust to it. When they had, he could make out the\nshadowed forms of the OD, the first class quartermaster at the wheel,\nand the radarman hunched over the repeater, the scope a phosphorescent\nblur in the darkness.\n\nThe ports were open in violation of GQ--it was a hot summer night--and\nthe slight breeze that blew off the swelling sea smelled clean and cool.\nIt was the only kind of air for a man to breathe, the Captain mused\nabstractly.\n\nHe glanced sharply through the ports. There was nothing that bulked on\nthe dark horizon, and so far as he could tell, all the stars were\nfixed--there were none of the tell-tale flashes of jet exhausts.\n\nHe walked over to where the OD stood by the radar scope, seemingly\nfascinated by the picture on it. McCandless had the watch, a young\nlieutenant of not more than twenty-five but one with good sense and\nsound judgment nonetheless. A man who wasn't prone to panic, the Captain\nthought.\n\n\"What's the situation, Lieutenant?\"\n\nMcCandless' voice was nervous. \"I'm not exactly sure, sir. Not ... yet.\"\n\nA brief regret at an interrupted dream of Ohio flickered in the back of\nthe Captain's mind.\n\n\"What do you mean, you're not sure?\" His voice was a little sharper\nthan he intended, a little more querulous than he had meant it to be. It\nwas, he thought, the voice of an old man, annoyed at having his sleep\ndisturbed.\n\nThe younger man wasn't disturbed by the sharpness and the Captain's\nestimation of McCandless went up another notch.\n\n\"Ten minutes ago CIC reported an object approaching us from the south at\nan altitude of fifty miles.\"\n\nApproaching from the south, the Captain thought. So it couldn't have\nbeen from the _Josef_. And fifty ... miles ... up. That was two hundred\nand fifty thousand feet. A guided missile, perhaps? But whose? There\nwere only friendly countries to the south.\n\n\"It's passed directly overhead,\" McCandless continued, consciously\ntrying to make his voice sound factual, \"and continued in the direction\nof _Josef_. It settled towards sea level, then stopped a mile up.\"\n\n\"Stopped, Lieutenant?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. It's hovering over the _Josef_ now.\" McCandless paused. When\nhe started again, his voice was shaking. It was funny he hadn't noticed\nit before, the Captain thought. You could almost smell the fear in the\nwheelhouse. \"CIC estimated its speed overhead as being in excess of a\nthousand miles an hour and its size about that of the _Josef_ itself.\"\n\nThe Captain felt the sweat gather on his temples and ran his hand half\nangrily over his forehead and through his thinning silver hair. He was\ntoo old a man to let fear affect him any more and he was too tired a man\nto waste his energy mopping his forehead every few minutes in a gesture\nthat would show his feelings to the crew. Maybe it was only vanity, he\nthought, but when your muscles went soft and started pushing back\nagainst your belt and your hair turned gray and started a strategic\nretreat, you tended to take more care of your reputation. It wasn't as\nfragile as the rest of you, it didn't tarnish with the gold of your\nbraid or sag with your muscles. And he had enjoyed a reputation as a\nfearless man of sound judgment.\n\n\"Did you order up a drone plane?\"\n\nMcCandless nodded in the dark. \"It went up a few minutes ago, sir. The\ntelevision picture should be coming in any moment.\"\n\nIt would be an infra-red picture, the Captain thought. It wouldn't show\ntoo much, provided the plane could get close enough to get anything at\nall, but it would show something.\n\n\"Have you made any evaluations, Lieutenant?\"\n\nHe could feel the tenseness build up again in the compartment. Everybody\nwas listening intently, waiting for the first semi-official hint of what\nhad gotten them up in the middle of the night.\n\nThen McCandless voiced what the Captain had already taken to be a\nforegone conclusion.\n\n\"I think it's a spaceship, sir.\" McCandless waved at the stars beyond\nthe port. \"From some place out there.\"\n\n\n\nThe picture started coming in at oh three hundred. The Captain and Davis\nand McCandless clustered about the infra-red screen, watching the\nshadowy picture build up.\n\nIt wasn't much of a picture, the Captain thought. It was vague and\nindistinct and the drone plane was shooting the scene from too far away.\nBut he could make out the _Dzugashvili_, a gloomy shape that bulked huge\nin the water, the planes clustered on its deck like small, black flies.\nBut that wasn't what interested him. He had seen restricted photographs\nand complete descriptions and evaluations of the _Josef_'s fighting\ncapabilities before. What was of vastly more importance was the huge\nstructure that hovered above the _Josef_, a mile overhead. A structure\nthat blocked out the stars over a roughly rectangular area the same size\nas the _Josef_ itself.\n\nMcCandless and Davis were still straining their eyes for details of the\nalien ship by the time the Captain had glanced away and was formulating\npolicy. The picture was too vague, he thought. There was nothing that\ncould be seen that would tell you much about the ship. And if they were\ncorrect in thinking it was a ... his mind hesitated at the thought ...\nspaceship, then it would be impossible to tell whether certain features\nwere armament or not. And it would be futile to speculate on the\ncapabilities of that armament.\n\nMcCandless and Davis finished with their inspection of the screen and\nturned to the Captain, waiting for orders.\n\n\"Recall the plane,\" the Captain said. \"Send it out again at dawn. And\nsend a message to Radio Washington, giving them complete details. You\nmay relax GQ but keep the gunners at their posts and the pilots standing\nby.\" The fantastic became far more real when you dealt with it\nmatter-of-factly, he thought.\n\nHe started for the hatch. \"I'll expect you down for breakfast,\" he said\nto Davis. \"You, too, Lieutenant. You've been in on this from the start,\nyou know more than the rest of us.\"\n\nWhich was quite enough flattery for a young lieutenant in one day, he\nthought. It was far more than he had ever received when he had been a\nlieutenant.\n\nBack in his stateroom, the Captain went directly to the small lavatory,\nfilled the washbowl, and plunged his face into the cold water. He was\ngetting old, he thought for the hundredth time that morning. Creeping\nold age where you still awoke readily enough but found it more and more\ndifficult to keep awake. You couldn't rid yourself of the temptation of\ngoing back to bed and dreaming again--dreaming, perhaps, of an Ohio town\nthat his own imagination had gilded and varnished and adorned until\nsometimes he thought it existed only in his imagination and not in\nreality at all.\n\nHe scrubbed at his face until a tingle of alertness came to it, then\nwent back to the main compartment. The steward had laid out the silver,\nand Davis and McCandless were already there. Davis completely relaxed in\nthe atmosphere that could only exist between an Executive Officer and a\nCaptain. The Exec, as both he and the Captain well knew, was the only\nman on board with whom the Captain could maintain a relationship that\nwas something other than professional. Not necessarily friendly but ...\nmore relaxed.\n\nMcCandless sat in the leather upholstered chair by the table, stiff and\nself-conscious. The hope of the nation, the Captain thought. Provided\nthat they learned how to hate and to keep that hate alive as long as he\nhad kept his.\n\nHis own boy had been about McCandless' age, he thought suddenly.\n\n\"Well, what are you going to do?\" Davis asked.\n\nThe Captain sat down at the table. The coffee was hot and he could smell\nthe eggs that the steward was frying in the small galley. He tucked in a\nnapkin at his neck. It was old-fashioned but practical, he thought. You\ndribbled down the front, you didn't spill things in your lap.\n\n\"It isn't exactly up to me, Harry. It's up to Washington.\" He poured out\nthree cups of coffee and handed one to Davis and one to McCandless. The\nLieutenant clutched the cup in a deathlike grip, as if the ship were\ndoing forty-degree rolls and he might lose it any minute. \"I asked you\nup to breakfast to get your ideas on it. I have my own but on something\nlike this, anybody's ideas are as good as mine. Maybe better.\"\n\nDavis frowned and rubbed the tip of his nose thoughtfully. \"Well, it\nlooks to me, Bill, as if we have a situation here where an unknown ship\nfrom somewhere--I'm not saying where--has investigated two ships on\nmaneuvers and finally chosen to hover over one, for what reasons we\ndon't know. To me it looks like the only things we can do is notify\nWashington and stand by for orders.\"\n\nGreat God, the Captain thought, disgusted, there was nothing worse than\na Commander bucking for four stripes. A more cautious man didn't exist\non the face of the Earth nor, possibly, a more fearful one. Fear that\nwhatever decision you made would be the wrong one and the Promotion\nBoard would pass you by. So you carefully avoided making any decisions\nat all. He had been the same way himself. You salved your lack of guts\nwith the knowledge that once you made captain, things would be different\nand you could assert yourself, be the man you had always considered\nyourself to be. Only once you became a captain things didn't change a\nbit, because then you were trying to get the Promotion Board to\nrecommend you for Admiral. The only men in the Navy who had any guts\nwere the young men who didn't know any better and the old bastards who\nhad made Admiral and no longer had any ambition as far as rank went.\n\n\n\nHe turned to McCandless. \"You, Lieutenant?\"\n\nMcCandless licked dry lips.\n\n\"I think it's from out in space, sir. Maybe it's an exploration party,\nbut more than likely it's an armed scouting party.\"\n\n\"What makes you say that?\"\n\nMcCandless leaned forward, his concern over his cup of coffee\nmomentarily forgotten. \"I think if it was an exploration party they\nwould have stopped at some point of civilization first. In all\nlikelihood a city, a big city. But we've received no reports of any ship\nlanding near a city. At least, not yet.\" He paused, a little\nself-consciously. \"It wouldn't be difficult to tell that we're part of\nthe fighting forces of this planet, and I think it's just luck that it\nchose the _Josef_ instead of us. I think the alien ship is investigating\nthe _Josef_. Or will shortly.\"\n\nDavis lit a cigarette, a half amused smile on his face. \"For what\npurpose?\"\n\n\"To test the armament. See how good we are on the defensive.\"\n\n\"What do you think they want?\" the Captain asked curiously.\n\nMcCandless hesitated, then blurted it out.\n\n\"The whole world, sir!\"\n\n\n\nAt oh five hundred the sun was just breaking over the horizon, coating\nthe heavy green seas with a soft covering of pink gold. It was going to\nbe another hot day, the Captain thought, one where the heat stood off\nthe water in little waves and the sweat ran down your back and soaked\nyour khakis. And with GQ, the rubber life jackets would make it about\nten times as bad.\n\nHe stood on the bridge for a moment, admiring the sunrise and smelling\nthe brisk salt air, then walked into the wheelhouse.\n\nThe drone plane had been up for half an hour. By this time it should\nhave a clearer picture of the object that hovered over the _Josef_.\n\nIt did. The object was dun colored, the color of storm clouds on a cold\nwinter's day. Big, easily as big as the _Josef_, and tubular shaped,\nslightly flattened on the bottom. There was nothing that could be\nidentified as gun ports but they probably didn't use guns. He wondered\njust what their armament was.\n\nHe turned to the radarman on watch.\n\n\"Has the _Josef_ moved any?\"\n\nThe man nodded. \"Yes, sir. About oh four hundred they steamed ten miles\nnorth at top speed.\"\n\n\"The object kept up with them?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. It's never left them, sir. Same position directly overhead at\nall times.\"\n\nThe captain of the _Josef_ must have realized that he couldn't get away\nfrom his overhead observer and probably froze in position, afraid of\nwhat would happen if he continued to run for it. He'd probably stay\nthere until the alien ship made some hostile move or he got instructions\nfrom home.\n\nThe Captain walked back to the bridge. The ship was strangely silent.\nThere were no jets warming up on the flight deck, there were no sounds\nof chipping hammers. Except for the planes overhead, it was a quiet\nsummer day, one of those days when a perfectly smooth sea looks like a\nsheet of plate glass.\n\nHe glanced down at the sides of the _Oahu_. Tiny figures were huddled by\nthe anti-aircraft guns, their helmets glinting in the sun. A tight ship,\nhe thought, a ship that was ready for anything.\n\nMcCandless came out on the bridge, his eyes red-rimmed from lack of\nsleep. He stood a respectful distance from the Captain, a little to the\nright and just behind.\n\n\"Beautiful day, isn't it, Lieutenant?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. It is, sir. Very fine day.\"\n\nSir. That was the one reason why he tolerated Davis, the Captain\nthought. Just to hear somebody call him by his first name and treat him\nas something other than a symbol of rank.\n\n\"If your theory is correct, Lieutenant,\" he mused aloud, \"then the alien\nship should be opening fire--if that's what you would call it--any\nminute now.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" McCandless brushed his mouth with his hand--probably\nsurreptitiously removing a wad of gum, the Captain thought. \"I was\nwondering what you would do, sir, if the alien ship opens fire on the\n_Josef_.\"\n\n\"If it wasn't against regulations, I'd issue a couple of cans of beer\nper man.\"\n\nMcCandless gaped. \"I--I don't understand you, sir.\"\n\n\"If they finish off the _Josef_, Lieutenant, it'll save us the trouble.\nFor my money, I'd be tickled pink if the Combine sent reinforcements and\nit really developed into a fracas.\"\n\nMcCandless turned slightly so the Captain could no longer read his face.\nThe Captain wondered if it was intentional.\n\n\"I ... I guess I just took it for granted that we'd join forces against\nthe aliens, sir. It seemed like the natural thing to do.\"\n\nSo McCandless had thought they'd go to the rescue of the _Josef_, the\nCaptain thought slowly. To the rescue. The phrase had a funny sound to\nit when you coupled it with the Combine, an almost obscene sound.\n\n\"Lieutenant,\" the Captain said slowly, \"history has been full of\npossible turning points that the United States has almost always failed\nto take advantage of. I think this time, just for once, we ought to play\nit smart. The Combine has been a threat for as long as I can remember.\nWe've had opportunities before when we could have let two systems cancel\neach other out. We didn't take advantage of it then and we've regretted\nit ever since.\"\n\nMcCandless didn't reply immediately and the Captain thought to himself,\nwhy not be more honest? Why don't you tell him that all your life you've\nfought the Combine and the conflict has been the only thing that has\nlent meaning to living? You hate for thirty years and you become a slave\nto that hatred--you don't forget it with a snap of the fingers and go\ncharging to the rescue like a knight in shining armor.\n\n\"The aliens are ... alien, sir,\" McCandless suddenly said. \"The men on\nthe _Josef_ are ... human beings.\"\n\n\"Are they, Mister?\" The Captain hated the lecturing attitude but he\ncouldn't help it. \"They're the representatives of the Combine, aren't\nthey? And I suppose the Combine acted like human beings during the\nBerlin war? I suppose the slave labor camps and the purges and the\nforced confessions were the products of ordinary human beings? No,\nLieutenant, if the aliens have six arms and two heads they couldn't be\nless inhuman than the Combine has been!\"\n\n\"My father was in the Pacific in the Second World War,\" the Lieutenant\nsaid tightly. \"There were times when we ... didn't take prisoners. And I\nremember my Dad saying that some of the men went home with ear\nnecklaces.\"\n\n\"Hearsay,\" the Captain said gruffly. \"And that was in a declared war.\"\nAnd then he wondered just how valid the distinction was. There were, he\nsupposed, sadists on both sides. And then it came down to who committed\nthe first cruelty and just how should you rank them? Was intentional\ntorture for the few any the worse than the dispassionate act of dropping\na bomb that produced quite the same, if not worse, results for the many?\n\n\"Just what would you do, Mister McCandless?\"\n\nThe Lieutenant's face was flushed. \"I'm not sure, sir. But I think I\nwould look at it from a strategic viewpoint. There are two ships here,\nboth instruments of war. If the aliens attack the one, and the other\ndoesn't go to the rescue, then it would be obvious that we are a divided\nworld. We would be a tempting ... prize.\"\n\n\"And if we went to the aid of the _Josef_, then you think we might beat\nthe alien ship off?\"\n\nMcCandless shrugged. \"I don't know, sir. We might.\"\n\nThe Captain turned back to look at the now swelling sea. The air off the\nwater was cool and brisk and the deck of his ship moved comfortably\nunder his feet; a solid thing in a liquid world.\n\n\"It doesn't make a great deal of difference what we think, Lieutenant,\"\nthe Captain said, a little of his good humor restored. \"In the long run,\nwe'll do whatever Washington says.\"\n\nThere was a sudden, flashing glow just over the horizon. McCandless\nblanched and the Captain clutched the rail, his knuckles turning white\nwith the force of his grip. There was another flash and the OD popped\nout of the hatch of the wheelhouse like a cork out of a bottle.\n\"Captain! the ...\"\n\nThe Captain was already brushing past him, heading into the pilothouse\nfor the television screen and the picture that the drone plane was\ntransmitting.\n\nThe picture on the screen wavered and blurred with the shock of the\naction. From what he could see, the Captain knew that whatever action he\ntook, if any, he would have to take it within a relative few minutes.\nThe forward half of the superstructure of the _Josef_ was a smoking\nruin, the metal a cherry red.\n\nHalf the planes on the flight deck were charred and being frantically\npushed overboard by small tractors so the remainder of the planes could\nbe airborne. A mile overhead, in the glazing blue sky, the few planes\nthe _Josef_ had managed to launch buzzed futilely about the alien ship,\ndischarging rockets that scintillated and flamed off the dull gray sides\nand, so far as the Captain could tell, were causing no damage at all.\n\n\"Message for you, sir.\"\n\nHe felt the clip board being pushed into his hand, then glanced down. It\nwas difficult to read without his glasses but he could make it out.\n\n_Unusual ... do nothing rash ... your discretion ..._\n\nSome cautious pen pusher behind a desk, he thought chaotically. Somebody\nfor whom miles had lent safety and detachment.\n\n_His_ discretion ...\n\nIt was his responsibility.\n\n\n\nCommander Davis was at his elbow. \"The _Josef_'s starting to list,\nCaptain.\"\n\n\"I can see that!\" he half snarled.\n\nHe wouldn't feel pity if the _Josef_ went down, he thought fiercely. It\nwould be good riddance, one less carrier that they would have to worry\nabout at some future date.\n\nIf there was some future date, a nagging thought intruded.\n\nHe throttled it. The _Josef_ stood for everything that he despised, a\nway of life that had made a mockery of everything he had been taught to\nbelieve in. The menace that had eaten at the world's vitals like a\ncancer, the menace whose existence had been enough to drive some men to\nhysteria and others to the brink of suicide. His own wife ...\n\nNow a ship from Outside was attacking that power and what emotions\nshould he feel? Elation? Well, why not? What other emotions should he\nfeel? Certainly not sadness, not regret, not pity.\n\nThe _Josef_ would be sunk and maybe the aliens would be tempted to do\nmore than just attack the _Josef_; they might attack the entire Combine\nas well. And if the Combine was beat, did it matter who did it?\n\nExcept, the thought crept back, there was no reason for him to believe\nthat the aliens would differentiate between the _Josef_ and the _Oahu_,\nbetween the Combine and the United States.\n\n\"The planes!\" McCandless said, incredulous. \"Look at the planes!\"\n\nThe Captain glanced down at the screen again. An orangish glow was\nsuffusing the alien ship. A jet slipped in for a rocket shot. The glow\npulsed, expanded, touched the jet, and the plane vanished into a rain of\nwreckage that sped towards the ocean below.\n\n\"God!\" Davis breathed. \"Did you see that?\"\n\nThe Captain only half heard him. So they were aliens. What did that\nmean? Beings of different background, different beliefs, different\nphysical structure? He had been one of the first into Berlin after the\nmassacre was over and the Combine had laid the blame on their Berlin\nCommandant, though it was painfully obvious that he had only followed\nout instructions. And the shambles he had seen there couldn't have been\ndone by human beings. Four thousand soldiers and close to a hundred\nthousand civilians killed. Would you call the people who had been\nresponsible for that human beings or ... aliens? Which name fit best?\n\nThe Berlin war ...\n\nA dozen different outbreaks, starting with Korea so long ago ...\n\nAnd then you were supposed to admit that they were blood brothers after\nall, and that in the face of a mutual threat you should forget your\ndifferences and pool your resources against the common enemy.\n\n\"There goes another one!\"\n\nSo in fifteen minutes the _Josef_ would go down. And from him it would\nbring only cheers, not tears.\n\nBut you didn't make decisions on a personal basis, he thought slowly.\nYou had to look at it from the viewpoint of a thousand years. You had to\ndevelop a certain detachment, even though one man's lifetime was far too\nshort a period to develop it in.\n\n\"Message for you, Captain.\"\n\nIt was a voice message that had been picked up in CIC. It was brief and\nto the point.\n\n    _Attention Captain United States Vessel_ Oahu:\n\n    _Help urgently requested. If aid not granted immediately, all is\n    lost._\n\n   _Constantin Simenovich,\n   Captain, People's Warship_ Josef Dzugashvili.\n\nHe had a brief mental picture of a young man lying in the shambles of\nBerlin calling out the same words. And what had he received?\n\nHe buried the thought.\n\nThe detached viewpoint. Political systems evolved, he thought, they\nnever remained the same. The French Revolution had spawned a thousand\nhuman monsters and the blood had run in the streets. But out of it all\nhad come a democratic nation. And a thousand years from now, what would\nthe Combine be? A turn of the wheel and perhaps it would be a\npeace-loving democracy while the United States would be the abattoir of\nhuman hopes. Who could tell? A thousand years from now the present\nbloodbaths and tortures and mass deaths would be history.\n\nBut if the aliens won you ran the chance of there being no history at\nall.\n\nThe wheelhouse was silent. The Captain could feel a dozen pairs of eyes\nwatching him, waiting for his decision. Outside the ports, on the far\nhorizon, there came a steady, golden pulsing.\n\nHe looked up at McCandless and Davis. McCandless was young, too\ninexperienced to realize that situations where today's enemies are\ntomorrow's friends are the order of the day and not the exception. You\nadjusted to it or you became bitter. Davis, the gutless bastard, had\nadjusted to it. He was probably already to make the switch, to go back\nto drinking toasts in vodka.\n\nThe detached viewpoint.\n\n\"Send up the jets,\" the Captain said slowly. \"And send a message to the\nCaptain of the _Josef_, telling him we'll render all the assistance that\nwe can.\"\n\nThe wheelhouse broke into a flurry of activity and a moment later he\ncould hear the sounds of the jets taking off the flight deck. He walked\nout on the bridge deck and leaned on the railing, staring at the horizon\nwhere the alien ship and the _Josef_ were fighting it out. And where\nplanes from the _Oahu_ would shortly be helping the _Josef_.\n\n_But I still hate them_, he thought. _I hate their goddamned souls!_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
