    "body": "Pop Ganlon was no hero--he was only a spaceman. A spaceman and a\nfather. In fact, Pop was rather no-account, even in a profession that\nabounded with drifters. He had made a meagre living prospecting\nasteroids and hauling light freight and an occasional passenger out\nin the Belt Region. Coffee and cakes, nothing more. Not many people\nknew Pop had a son in the Patrol, and even fewer knew it when the boy\nwas blasted to a cinder in a back alley in Lower Marsport.\n\nPop went on eating and breathing, but his life was over after that. He\nhit the bottle a little harder and his ship, _The Luck_, grew rustier\nand tackier, and those were the only outward signs that Pop Ganlon was\na living dead man. He kept on grubbing among the cold rocks and\npushing _The Luck_ from Marsport to Callisto and back with whatever\nlow-mass payloads he could pick up. He might have lived out his string\nof years like that, obscure and alone, if it hadn't been for John\nKane. Kane was Pop Ganlon's ticket to a sort of personal\nimmortality--if there is such a thing for an old spaceman.\n\nIt was in Yakki, down-canal from Marsport, that Kane found Pop. There\nis a small spaceport there--a boneyard, really--for buckets whose\nskippers can't pay the heavy tariff imposed by the big ramp. All the\nwrecks nest there while waiting hopefully for a payload or a\ngrubstake. They have all of Solis Lacus for a landing field, and if\nthey spill it doesn't matter much. The drifting red sands soon cover\nup the scattered shards of dural and the slow, lonely life of Yakki\ngoes on like before.\n\nThe Patrol was on Kane's trail and the blaster in his hand was still\nwarm when he shoved it up against Pop Ganlon's ribs and made his\nproposition.\n\nHe wanted to get off Mars--out to Callisto. To Blackwater, to Ley's\nLanding, it didn't matter too much. Just off Mars, and quickly. His\neyes had a metallic glitter and his hand was rock-steady. Pop knew he\nmeant what he said when he told him life was cheap. Someone else's\nlife, not Kane's.\n\n\n\nThat's how it happened that _The Luck_ lifted that night from Yakki,\noutward bound for Ley's Landing, with Pop and Kane aboard her alone.\n\nSitting at the battered console of _The Luck_, Pop watched his\npassenger. He knew Kane, of course. Or rather, he knew of him. A\nkiller. The kind that thrives and grows fat on the frontiers. The\nbulky frame, the cropped black hair, the predatory eyes that looked\nlike two blaster muzzles. They were all familiar to Pop. Kane was all\nsteel and meanness. The kind of carrion bird that took what others had\nworked for. Not big time, you understand. In another age he'd have\nbeen a torpedo--a hireling killer. But out among the stars he was\nworking for himself. And doing well.\n\nPop didn't care. His loyalty to the Patrol had stopped quite suddenly\nnot long before--in a dark alley in Lower Marsport. This was only a\njob, he told himself now. A job for coffee and cakes, and maybe a\ngrubstake to work a few more lonely rocks. Life had become a habit for\nPop, even if living had ended.\n\n\"What are you staring at, Pop?\" Kane's voice was like the rest of him.\nHarsh and cold as space itself.\n\n\"At you, I guess,\" Pop said, \"I was wondering what you'd done--and\nwhere--and to whom.\"\n\n\"You're a nosey old man,\" Kane said. \"Just get me to Ley's Landing.\nThat's what I'm paying for, not a thing more.\"\n\nPop nodded slowly and turned back to the control board. They were\nabove the Belt by now, and a few short hours from turnover point. The\ncranky drives of _The Luck_ needed all his attention.\n\nPresently he said, \"We'll be turning over soon. Want to get some\nrest?\"\n\nKane laughed. \"No thanks, old man. I'll stay here and watch you.\"\n\nPop eyed the ready blaster and nodded again. He wondered vaguely how\nit would feel to die under the blast of such a weapon. It couldn't be\nvery painful. He hoped it wasn't painful. Perhaps the boy hadn't\nsuffered. It would be nice to be sure, he thought.\n\nThere wasn't much for Pop to remember about the boy. He'd never been\none for writing many letters. But the District Patrolman had come down\nto Yakki and looked Pop up--afterward. He'd said the boy was a good\nofficer. A good cop. Died doing his job, and all that sort of thing.\nPop swallowed hard. His job. What had 'his job' been that night in\nLower Marsport, he wondered. Had someone else finished it for him?\n\nHe remembered about that time hearing on the Mars Radio that a\nTriangle Post Office had been knocked over by a gunman. That might\nhave been it. The Patrol would be after anyone knocking over EMV\nTriangle property. The Earth-Mars-Venus Government supported the\nPatrol for things like that.\n\nPop guided _The Luck_ skillfully above the Belt, avoiding with\npracticed ease the few errant chunks of rock that hurtled up out of\nthe swarms. He talked to Kane because he was starved for\ntalk--certainly not because he was trying to play Sherlock. Pop had\nlong ago realized that he was no mental giant. Besides, he owed the\nPatrol nothing. Not a damned thing.\n\n\"Made this trip often?\" Pop tried to strike up a conversation with\nKane. His long loneliness seemed sharper, somehow, more poignant,\nwhen he actually had someone to talk to.\n\n\"Not often. I'm no space pig.\" It was said with scorn.\n\n\"There's a lot to spacing, you know,\" Pop urged.\n\nKane shrugged. \"I know easier ways to make a buck, old timer.\"\n\n\"Like how?\"\n\n\"A nosey old man, like I said,\" Kane smiled. Somehow, the smile wasn't\nfriendly. \"Okay, Pop, since you ask. Like knocking off wacky old\nprospectors for their dust. Or sticking up sandcar caravans out in\nSyrtis. Who's the wiser? The red dust takes care of the leftovers.\"\n\nPop shook his head. \"Not for me. There's the Patrol to think of.\"\n\nKane laughed. \"Punks. Bell-boys. They'd better learn to shoot before\nthey leave their school-books.\"\n\nPop Ganlon frowned slightly. \"You talk big, mister.\"\n\nKane's eyes took on that metallic glitter again. He leaned forward and\nthrew a canvas packet on the console. It spilled crisp new EMV\ncertificates. Large ones. \"I take big, too,\" he said.\n\nPop stared. Not at the money. It was more than he had ever seen in one\npile before, but it wasn't that that shook him. It was the canvas\npacket. It was marked: _Postal Service, EMV_. Pop suddenly felt cold,\nas though an icy wind had touched him.\n\n\"You ... you killed a Patrolman for this,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"That's right, Pop,\" grinned Kane easily. \"Burned him down in an alley\nin Lower Marsport. It was like taking candy from a baby....\"\n\nPop Ganlon swallowed hard. \"Like taking candy from a ... baby. As easy\nas that....\"\n\n\"As easy as that, old man,\" Kane said.\n\n\n\nPop knew he was going to die then. He knew Kane would blast him right\nafter turnover point, and he knew fear. He felt something else, too.\nSomething that was new to him. Hate. An icy hate that left him shaken\nand weak.\n\nSo the boy's job hadn't been finished. It was still to do.\n\nThere was no use in dreaming of killing Kane. Pop was old. Kane was\nyoung--and a killer. Pop was alone and without weapons--save _The\nLuck_....\n\nTime passed slowly. Outside, the night of deep space keened\nsoundlessly. The stars burned bright, alien and strange. It was time,\nthought Pop bleakly. Time to turn _The Luck_.\n\n\"Turnover point,\" he said softly.\n\nKane motioned with his blaster. \"Get at it.\"\n\nPop began winding the flywheel. It made a whirring sound in the\nconfined space of the tiny control room. Outside, the night began to\npivot slowly.\n\n\"We have to turn end-for-end,\" Pop said. \"That way we can decelerate\non the drop into Callisto. But, of course, you know all about that,\nMr. Kane.\"\n\n\"I told you I'm no space pig,\" Kane said brusquely. \"I can handle a\nlanding and maybe a takeoff, but the rest of it I leave for the\nboatmen. Like you, Pop.\"\n\nPop spun the flywheel in silence, listening to the soft whir.\nPresently, he let the wheel slow and then stop. He straightened and\nlooked up at Kane. The blaster muzzle was six inches from his belly.\nHe swallowed against the dryness in his throat.\n\n\"You ... you're going to kill me,\" Pop said. It wasn't a question.\nKane smiled, showing white teeth.\n\n\"I ... I know you are,\" Pop said unsteadily. \"But first, I want to say\nsomething to you.\"\n\n\"Talk, old timer,\" Kane said. \"But not too much.\"\n\n\"That boy--that boy you killed in Marsport. He was my son,\" Pop said.\n\nKane's face did not change expression. \"Okay. So what?\"\n\nPop's lips twitched. \"I just wanted to hear you say it.\" He looked at\nthe impassive face of the killer. \"You made a mistake, Mr. Kane. You\nshouldn't have done that to my boy.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\nPop nodded slowly. \"I guess that's all.\"\n\nKane grinned. \"Afraid, old man?\"\n\n\"I'm a space pig,\" Pop said. \"Space takes care of its own.\"\n\n\"You're in a bad way, old timer,\" Kane said, \"and you haven't much\nsense. I'm doing you a favor.\"\n\nPop lifted his hands in an instinctive gesture of futile protection as\nthe blaster erupted flame.\n\nThere was a smell in the control room like burnt meat as Kane\nholstered his weapon and turned the old man over with a foot. Pop was\na blackened mass. Kane dragged him to the valve and jettisoned the\nbody into space.\n\n\n\nAlone among the stars, _The Luck_ moved across the velvet night. The\nsteady beat of flame from her tubes was a tiny spark of man-made\nvengeance on the face of the deeps.\n\nFrom her turnover point, she drove outward toward the spinning Jovian\nmoons. For a short while she could be seen from the EMV Observatory on\nCallisto, but very soon she faded into the outer darkness.\n\nMuch later, the Observatory at Land's End on Triton watched her\nheading past the gibbous mass of Pluto--out into the interstellar\nfastnesses.\n\nThe thrumming of the jets was still at last. A wild-eyed thing that\nmay once have been a man stared in horror at the fading light of the\nyellow star far astern.\n\nIt had taken Kane time to understand what had happened to him, and now\nit was too late. Space had taken care of its own. The air in _The\nLuck_ was growing foul and the food was gone. Death hung in the fetid\natmosphere of the tiny control room.\n\nThe old man--the boy--the money. They all seemed to spin in a\nnarrowing circle. Kane wanted suddenly to shriek with laughter. A\ncircle. The turnover circle. The full circle that the old man had made\ninstead of the proper half-turn of a turnover. Three hundred sixty\ndegrees instead of one hundred eighty. Three hundred sixty degrees to\nleave the nose of _The Luck_ pointing outward toward the stars,\ninstead of properly toward the Sun. A full circle to pile G on G until\nthe Jovian moons were missed, and the Uranian moons and Triton, too.\n_Ad Astra per Ardua...._\n\nWith the last fragment of his failing sanity, Kane thought of how Pop\nGanlon and the boy must be laughing. He was still thinking that as the\nlong night closed in around him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
