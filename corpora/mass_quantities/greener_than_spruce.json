The old-timer\u2019s perpetual\n\u201csun-grin\u201d expanded visibly as he watched Benton\u2019s parka-clad figure\ndisappear around a bend in the river trail.\n\n\u201cWonder how long he\u2019ll last,\u201d the old fellow speculated, turning to\nthe group on the river bank. \u201cI\u2019ll bet I\u2019ve showed him a dozen times\nhow to tie his snowshoes to his feet, an\u2019 I\u2019ve told him little\nthings about pitchin\u2019 his tent and makin\u2019 camp, till I\u2019m black in\nthe face. It\u2019ll be three-four weeks yet before mushin\u2019ll be any\ngood, but I\u2019ve got a right good notion to load up the old Yukon sled\nan\u2019 take out after that young chechahco.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 why?\u201d\n\nThe old-timer had paused for that query. The question certainly gave\npith and point to the clever thing on the tip of his tongue. The\nremark would have lost its savor in the telling; the retort,\nhowever, was pungent.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 why?\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you for why. I\u2019ve been snow-blind\ntwice, so my eyes ain\u2019t what they used to be. Nowadays, when I ain\u2019t\nwearin\u2019 snow glasses--an\u2019 blast the dang things, I hate \u2019em!-- I\u2019ve\ngot to keep my eyes clamped on the spruce.\n\n\u201cSpruce is dang restful to the eyes. It\u2019s restful because it\u2019s\ngreen, but to keep on lookin\u2019 at it, a man\u2019s got to twist his head\nfrom one side the river to the other, an\u2019 there\u2019s times when I think\nI\u2019m li\u2019ble to twist my head plum off--like a screech owl. Now,\ninstead of takin\u2019 all that trouble, I _could_ start out an\u2019 foller\nafter this young Benton. Instead of lookin\u2019 at the spruce then, I\ncould keep my eyes fastened straight ahead on _him_. He\u2019s greener\nthan any spruce that ever growed.\u201d\n\nIf young Harris Benton could have heard this sarcastic speech, he\nwould have been rudely made aware of the withering contempt in which\nhe was held by the general run of Alaskans with whom he had come in\ncontact. Had he been aware of the feeling which existed, he would\nnot have been offended in the least; he would have been amused. He\nwas green but, unlike many greenhorns, he realized the fact and was\nanxious to learn. Moreover, he was willing to accept the hard\nknocks--a part of the curriculum of Alaska\u2019s trail school--and come\nup smiling. For Harris Benton, although he was probably the greenest\nchechahco in the North, had not been raised a pet.\n\nAt noon, young Benton hauled his sled to the river bank and, with\nconsiderable difficulty, dropped a dead spruce tree and built a\nsmall tea fire. After his noon meal he unloaded his Yukon sled,\ninverted it so that the steel-shod runners shone like twin mirrors\nin the rays of the sun; then--and this is almost past believing--he\nproceeded to smear the steel shoes of the sled runners with\nlubricating oil.\n\nThe dealer who had sold him the oil--either unscrupulous or a\npractical joker--had seriously informed him that \u201cgreased sled\nrunners makes mighty easy slippin\u2019 on the trail.\u201d Harris Benton had\ninnocently bought five gallons of the lubricant.\n\nWhere a musher pulls without dogs, as young Benton was doing, every\npound of excess weight is an additional check to his progress. And\nbesides the five gallons of lubricating oil, Harris Benton was\nhauling other nonessentials. He had more clothing than he really\nneeded; about twenty pounds of books and old magazines, and the\nmerchant from whom he had bought his outfit had sold him far too\nmany cooking utensils. Benton\u2019s entire outfit weighed almost twelve\nhundred pounds, and, since at best he could haul but four hundred\npounds on his Yukon sled, he was relaying. He would haul from three\nto four hundred pounds as far up the river trail as he could\npossibly travel in a day, cache his load, and return to his camp\nwith his empty sled.\n\nEarly in the month of May he reached the Kentna country. He had been\non the trail four months, and he had arrived with pick, pan, and\nshovel, together with ample food to last him through the mining\nseason. Also--as every old-timer in the Kentna country will\ntestify--he had arrived with the ambition and energy of a half dozen\nmen in spite of the grueling work on the trail.\n\nYoung Benton spent his first week after arriving at \u201cthe cricks\u201d in\nbuilding a cache for his supplies. It was a simple box affair, built\nof logs, supported high in air by four posts. He was busily stowing\nhis food and other supplies in the cache, when a voice at his elbow\nbrought him about with a start. Looking up from his work, he saw the\nold-timer who had offered him many helpful suggestions back at the\ntrading post. The old man was surveying him, his small stock of\nprovisions, and his crude cache, with frank curiosity.\n\n\u201cWell, I see you landed here all right,\u201d he remarked by way of\ngreeting. \u201cI\u2019m camped just above here on Penny Ante Crick, an\u2019 I\nain\u2019t got a thing to do till the snow goes off, so I thought I\u2019d\nmush over an\u2019 see how you\u2019re gettin\u2019 along. Staked yourself a claim\nyet?\u201d\n\nBenton admitted that he had not. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was lawful to\nstake a claim unless you discover gold,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cPlenty of \u2019em stakes first an\u2019 find the gold afterward--if there\u2019s\nany to be found.\u201d The old man\u2019s rheumy eyes were mildly\ndisapproving. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about makin\u2019 my discovery,\nif I was you. Most any gravel you find around here carries _some_\ngold. Trouble is to find it in payin\u2019 quantities. So hurry up an\u2019\nstake yourself a claim or two, before some of these ground hogs\ncomes in on the first boat this summer an\u2019 grabs it all. Us\nold-timers takes just what we can work to good advantage, but most\ngreenhorns\u2019ll wear out a pair of hobnail shoes just a-racin\u2019 over\nthe country stakin\u2019. You\u2019re lucky to be here among the first, so\nhurry up an\u2019 get busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for the tip. I\u2019ll----\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business,\u201d the old-timer suddenly interrupted, \u201cbut\nwhat in thunder have you brought into the country in _that_?\u201d\n\nBenton had placed his five-gallon can of lubricating oil near the\ncache, and it was that which had elicited the question. He was\nsomewhat puzzled.\n\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s my oil,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you carry yours?\u201d\n\nThe ancient sour dough had all he could do to keep a straight face.\nThis green chechahco had actually brought kerosene into this\nwilderness!\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have no use for a lamp,\u201d he said gently. \u201cAll summer you\ncan read fine print right in your tent--any hour of the night, too.\nI thought ev\u2019ry-body knowed----\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no lamp,\u201d young Benton interrupted impatiently. \u201cI\u2019m green\nbut I\u2019m not quite a fool--I hope. That isn\u2019t oil for a lamp; it\u2019s\nabout four gallons of lubricating oil that I had left over from my\nwinter\u2019s sledding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d The old man shifted his weight from one moccasined foot to\nthe other, swallowing his Adam\u2019s apple twice before he once more\nfound his voice. \u201cI understand you but I don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cHow much of this oil did you use an\u2019 how did you use it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I used about a gallon.\u201d Young Benton was looking doubtfully\nat the old man. \u201cI think I see what you\u2019re driving at now. I allowed\nthat storekeeper to sell me five gallons when one was all that I\nneeded.\u201d\n\nThe old-timer lifted his tufted eyebrows. \u201cAn\u2019 you got through the\nwinter with one gallon,\u201d he said softly, wonderingly.\n\n\u201cWhy, I only used it in the morning and again at noon. Just when\nI--but maybe I didn\u2019t use it often enough. Still, the sled came\nalong pretty well.\u201d\n\nThe old-timer barked apologetically in his mittened hand. At last he\nunderstood. It had been so many years since he had heard of the old\njoke of greasing sled runners that he had forgotten. But this boy\nwas so very much in earnest, it wouldn\u2019t do to hurt his feelings.\nAnd besides, it might lead to serious trouble. This innocent youth\nhad dragged this worthless stuff over the trail--pounds and pounds\nof it. Murder had been committed for less than a joke like that!\n\n\u201cThe skinflint sold you too much, all right,\u201d he said, as he reached\ndown and thoughtfully \u201chefted\u201d the can. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got it here--I\nreckon you might as well forget it. Anyhow, you won\u2019t have any more\nuse for it. You\u2019re all through sleddin\u2019. An\u2019 now I\u2019d better be\ngettin\u2019 along. If you want anything this summer, you\u2019ll find me over\non Penny Ante Crick. Number Five Above Discovery\u2019s the name of my\nclaim.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarris Benton was highly elated when he next saw the old-timer. Not\nonly had he staked a claim on what he called Benton Gulch but he had\nactually discovered gold and he had found it in paying quantities.\nFor a week he had panned the gravel on Benton Gulch, and he was now\ndisplaying his sample to the old-timer. The old man listened\nattentively to the boy\u2019s story, but did not enthuse over the sample.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come clean over here to Penny Ante Crick to show me this,\nan\u2019 I\u2019m right sorry to have to disappoint you.\u201d In spite of the old\nman\u2019s words, young Benton was grinning cheerfully. \u201cIt takes a whole\nlot to discourage a young rooster like you,\u201d he resumed, \u201cbut I\u2019ll\nsoon show you why you\u2019ve got to leave that gulch alone. I don\u2019t\ndoubt what you say. You got the gold here to prove it. But how\u2019re\nyou goin\u2019 to work the ground? Answer me that.\u201d\n\nHarris Benton still grinned. \u201cI know why you think I can\u2019t work that\nground,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you old-timers call a dry gulch. I know\nthere won\u2019t be drinking water there this summer. What you overlooked\nis this. By digging a ditch less than a quarter mile in length I can\nget one of the best sluice heads in this country. Right over that\nshoulder at the head of my gulch is where I----\u201d\n\n\u201cI know where you mean, all right,\u201d interrupted the old-timer. \u201cBut\nhave you talked with Joe Murtry yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t even seen him. But why should I talk to him? What has he to\ndo with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cEv\u2019rything. Joe Murtry owns ev\u2019ry drop of water in Caribou Crick.\nHe recorded it last spring a year ago.\u201d\n\nYoung Benton was on the point of interrupting, but the old-timer\nsilenced him. \u201cNow don\u2019t start to tell me that all you\u2019ve got to do\nis to go over to Caribou Crick an\u2019 get Joe Murtry to give you the\nright to take what water you want, for Joe ain\u2019t that kind. He ain\u2019t\nonly the luckiest man in Alasky--he\u2019s the _meanest_. If he\u2019s worth a\ndime, he\u2019s worth a half million right now, but even so, he wouldn\u2019t\ngive a man daylight in a dark cellar. You just forget you ever\nstaked a claim on that little gulch an\u2019 start out prospectin\u2019 for\nsomething that\u2019ll do you some good.\u201d\n\nYoung Benton thanked the old man for his advice. \u201cBut,\u201d he added,\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to start out prospectin\u2019, when I\u2019ve already\ndiscovered gold--unless I\u2019m forced to do so. I\u2019m going over to see\nMurtry at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right; but be ready to run if he comes at you. He\u2019s the meanest\nman in Alasky, bar none. Joe Murtry never done no man a favor, an\u2019\nhe never will. Mark what I tell you, son. He\u2019ll chase you off his\nground just as soon as you show up an\u2019 tell him what you want.\nYou\u2019re just wastin\u2019 your time. But, then, that\u2019s the trouble with\nall chechahcos; they won\u2019t listen to an old-timer\u2019s advice.\u201d\n\nYoung Benton went at once to Caribou Creek. In spite of what he had\nheard of Joe Murtry, he was not convinced. There was an abundance of\nwater in Caribou Creek, and surely no man would be mean enough to\nrefuse to allow the use of the surplus. This line of reasoning gave\nhim great confidence, but his first glimpse of Murtry caused his\nheart to sink.\n\nMurtry was not tall, but he was as broad as two average-sized men.\nYet he was not fat. His arms were unusually long, and, due to a\nslight stoop to his powerful shoulders, his huge hands hung slightly\nahead of his knees. Young Benton looked at him and instantly thought\nof a gorilla. With two others, Murtry was setting up a string of\nsluice boxes.\n\nBenton watched them for a time; twice, without waiting to be asked,\nhe gave them a hand. Murtry, who had barely spoken, paused at last\nand sized up his caller. What he saw evidently satisfied him.\n\n\u201cWant a job?\u201d he asked gruffly. \u201cI\u2019m taking one of these men upriver\ntomorrow, an\u2019 if you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for work, you can stay here an\u2019 help\nSam. Do whatever he tells you.\u201d\n\nHere was a golden opportunity. Surely if he favored Murtry, he might\nexpect the big fellow to reciprocate. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for work for\nthe season,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be glad to help out for a few\ndays--if that will do you any good.\u201d\n\nMurtry grunted. \u201cAll I need,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a foreman an\u2019\nfifteen men waitin\u2019 for me upriver. They mush in from the\ncoast--their time starts the first of June whether they\u2019re here or\nnot. Hunderd an\u2019 fifty miles from here. I\u2019m goin\u2019 up in my boat an\u2019\nbring \u2019em down. You stay an\u2019 help Sam out till I come back with my\nmen, an\u2019 I\u2019ll pay you the goin\u2019 wages--ten bucks an\u2019 grub.\u201d\n\nSam soon shuffled off to cook the evening meal, and Benton decided\nto say nothing about his sluice head of water until after they had\neaten. Their pipes going, he thought it time to broach the subject.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you that I was a neighbor of yours,\u201d he said by way\nof opening the conversation. \u201cI spent the winter sledding in my\noutfit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat so?\u201d Murtry said with a mild simulation of interest. \u201cWhere\nyou camped?\u201d\n\nBenton indicated the direction. \u201cRight over there,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve\nnamed it Benton Gulch.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t staked that little dry gulch?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, yes. You see, I believe there\u2019s a little gold there--I don\u2019t\nknow how much--I\u2019ve already done quite a bit of panning and I hope\nto----\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fool!\u201d Murtry interrupted in a rage. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know\nthat I own ev\u2019ry drop of water in Caribou Crick, it\u2019s time you was\nlearnin\u2019. How do you aim to work that gulch without water?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I came over to see you about,\u201d said Benton. \u201cI heard\nthat it was your water and I thought that you would be glad to spare\nme a sluice head.\u201d Benton was speaking calmly, in spite of the\nother\u2019s belligerent attitude. \u201cOf course,\u201d he went on, \u201cif the water\nin Caribou Crick should run low this summer or fall, I\u2019d quit taking\nit out, but----\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d _quit_ takin\u2019 it out!\u201d Murtry cried. \u201cYou\u2019re never goin\u2019 to\n_begin_ takin\u2019 it out! If you ever start monkeyin\u2019 with Caribou\nCrick, I\u2019ll drill you so full of holes you\u2019ll look like----\u201d\n\nMurtry\u2019s anger was intensified by his failure to find the word he\nwas seeking. \u201cSay,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou get clean off this claim! Beat it\nquick, while you\u2019re all together!\u201d\n\nBenton was sitting at the rough table; he rose slowly. \u201cWhy\ncertainly--if it\u2019s your claim--I\u2019ll leave.\u201d He was speaking\nhesitantly but he was not afraid of the glowering bully who had\ncommanded him to leave. He was simply surprised at the man\u2019s\nunreasonable anger. \u201cBut even if I have no water, that gulch belongs\nto me, and I mean to hold it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold it as long as you want to!\u201d Murtry was shouting after him.\n\u201cHold it till you get good an\u2019 tired of doing assessment work on it!\nWait a minute till I tell you something you\u2019d just as well know now\nas later!\u201d Benton paused and Murtry continued. \u201cThere ain\u2019t any gold\nin that gulch, but even if there was, _you\u2019d_ never get to work it.\nI\u2019ve got the water an\u2019 I aim to keep it!\u201d\n\nThe old-timer was right. He was right about everything! He had said\nthat Joe Murtry was the meanest man in Alaska; he had said that no\nmatter how much gold the tiny gulch might carry, Murtry would never\nallow it to be worked. Benton considered the various things that the\nold-timer had told him until he reached his camp in Benton Gulch.\nWell, he decided, he would follow the old man\u2019s advice and quit the\ngulch on the following day.\n\nBenton had been prospecting the gulch every day for more than a\nweek. Through force of habit he took his pick, shovel and gold pan,\nand went to work in the narrow cut which he had been running into a\nshoulder of the hill near his tent. He was far from an expert with\nthe gold pan, but he enjoyed the beginner\u2019s thrill, which always\ncame when he \u201ctailed off\u201d the residue in the pan, and saw the streak\nof yellow trickling behind the black sand.\n\nYoung Benton extended his cut three feet into the hill. He was\nfollowing along the disintegrated slate bed rock; although he did\nnot realize it, the bedrock was totally different. Before it had\nbeen \u201cslick,\u201d now it was rough and \u201crotten.\u201d\n\nHe filled his pan with gravel and carried it to a hole which he had\ndug in the gulch\u2019s channel. Now the hole was filled with water from\nthe melting snows; in a week, perhaps, it would be dry. At least the\nold-timer had said that it would, and Benton was now a firm believer\nin the wisdom of the old man.\n\nIt is a maxim with old-timers that \u201cmany things are mistaken for\ngold, but gold is never mistaken for anything else.\u201d A greenhorn is\noften fooled, for example, by iron pyrites and \u201ccube\u201d iron, but when\nhe discovers gold, the real thing, he knows. So it was with Benton.\nFor a week he had been panning \u201cpinhead stuff\u201d that would \u201crattle in\nthe pan.\u201d Now, as he \u201ctailed off\u201d the pan he had taken from the\ndisintegrated bed rock, he saw that a half-dozen dull-yellow pieces\nof gold were in the bottom of the pan. Benton\u2019s old-timer would have\npronounced them slugs.\n\nBenton was excited. He held the slugs in the palm of his hand, while\nhe attempted to estimate their value. The smallest of them, he\ndecided, was fully twice as large as a five-dollar gold piece; the\nlargest was surely worth more than twenty dollars. The six slugs\nwould total almost a hundred dollars. Chechahco that he was, Benton\nstill knew that he had uncovered bonanza dirt.\n\nYoung Benton went again to his cut. This time he worked feverishly\nfor two hours. His pay streak was rich, extremely so, but there was\na heavy overburden to handle. In other words, above the pay he had\ndiscovered on bed rock, lay ten, twenty, possibly as much as fifty\nfeet of muck and gravel. Undoubtedly the ground was rich enough that\nhe could take out hundreds of dollars that summer without water, but\nif he could only manage to get that sluicehead from Caribou Creek,\nhe could with a pressure hose, run that overburden off like so much\nsoup. He _must_ have that water? But how?\n\nAt five o\u2019clock next morning young Benton was seated on the stump of\na spruce where the clear waters of Caribou Creek gushed into the\nbrown foam-flecked river. He looked at Murtry\u2019s river boat which was\nbeached near by. It rested on two fresh-peeled logs, and Benton saw\nthat all preparations had been recently made to launch the vessel.\nAt six o\u2019clock, Murtry and one of his men put in an appearance.\nBenton had no time to lose; he spoke to Murtry at once.\n\n\u201cMurtry,\u201d he said, without rising from his stump, \u201cI\u2019ve been\nthinking the matter over and I wonder if you would consider\n_selling_ me a sluice head of water from Caribou Crick. I\u2019ll pay you\nwhat it is worth.\u201d\n\nMurtry paid him no attention. He and his man put their shoulders at\nthe stern of the boat and skidded the vessel into the river. Murtry\nmade a line fast to a convenient \u201cdead man,\u201d while his man leaped\ninto the stern of the boat and started the engine. No sooner did he\nhave the engine purring rhythmically, than he shut it off.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Murtry, who was about to cast off and leap\naboard, made the line fast again. \u201cAnything wrong with that engine?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but----\u201d The man was looking at Murtry in wide-eyed alarm. He\nwas afraid to tell what was wrong, and yet he dared not remain\nsilent. \u201cMr. Murtry,\u201d he said, speaking swiftly, as if anxious to\nbreak the news as quickly as possible, \u201cthere ain\u2019t a single drop of\nengine oil. I spoke to Sam about it last night after we\u2019d loaded the\nother stuff aboard, an\u2019 he said there was plenty of oil here. But I\njust looked an\u2019 there\u2019s nothin\u2019 but gasoline. There\u2019s more gasoline\nthan we need, but there ain\u2019t a drop of----\u201d\n\n\u201cYou idiot!\u201d Murtry exclaimed. \u201cChase right up to camp an\u2019 get some\nout of the cache an\u2019 hurry!\u201d\n\nMurtry\u2019s man leaped ashore, but stood hesitantly, shifting his feet\nas if in a quandary.\n\n\u201cHurry! I don\u2019t want to wait here all day!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go look again, but I looked last evenin\u2019 an\u2019 there wasn\u2019t any\nthere. At least I didn\u2019t see it. That\u2019s why Sam was so sure there\nwas plenty on the boat.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s there. If you don\u2019t find it in the cache, look in\nthe tool shed.\u201d\n\nAt this the man shuffled off. Young Benton was much pleased at\nMurtry\u2019s unexpected delay, but he was somewhat nettled at the manner\nin which he had been ignored. He decided to try again, and this time\nhe would do his utmost to make Murtry answer him.\n\n\u201cI suppose you didn\u2019t hear me a bit ago,\u201d he began, \u201cbut----\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard you the first time,\u201d Murtry interrupted with an oath. \u201cNow\nshut your yap an\u2019 get out!\u201d\n\nBenton did not move. Seeing this, Murtry\u2019s great hamlike hands\ntwisted about convulsively; his lips drew back against his uneven\nteeth, and with an enraged snarl he quickly rushed at the youth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you if you move or not!\u201d he shouted. \u201cOnce I get a hold\nof you, I\u2019ll----\u201d\n\nMurtry suddenly brought up with a sharp exclamation. Ten feet from\nBenton, he had stopped with an expression of bewilderment on his\nbroad face. He was gazing like a man fascinated into the barrel of\nan automatic.\n\n\u201cI came ready for you,\u201d said young Benton coolly. \u201cI\u2019m not on your\nclaim, and I don\u2019t see you or anybody else throwing me off of\ngovernment land. And now, you can at least listen to what I have to\nsay, even if you don\u2019t care to----\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll listen, you young pup,\u201d Murtry said, \u201cbut there\u2019s a day\ncomin\u2019. You\u2019ll wake up some day an\u2019 learn that what I say goes in\nthis neck of the woods.\u201d\n\nMurtry advanced a step as he said this. \u201cAnd you,\u201d said Benton as he\nmenaced Murtry with his weapon, \u201cmay _never_ wake up, if you come\nanother step in this direction. There, that\u2019s better,\u201d he went on as\nMurtry retreated a step. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been told, Murtry, you\u2019re a\nmighty rich man. It won\u2019t bother you in the least to sell--or give\nme, for that matter--some of your water. You\u2019ve got your pile made.\nNow be decent and give me a chance to get out of this country with a\nlittle money for all the hardship I\u2019ve gone through. Will you listen\nto a sensible proposition?\u201d\n\n\u201cRave on,\u201d said Murtry sullenly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me dead to rights. Talk\naway if it does you any good, but you\u2019ll get nothin\u2019 out of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a third of all the money I take out,\u201d said Benton,\nspeaking slowly and distinctly. \u201cIf you\u2019ll give me the water to work\nthe ground. Is it a go?\u201d\n\nMurtry opened his lips as if he intended to reply; then closed them\ntightly. A minute passed and he seemed to reconsider. \u201cYou might as\nwell trot along,\u201d he said contemptuously. \u201cUse your brains. Why\n_would_ I take a third? If there\u2019s any money there, I can have it\nall after you starve out; an\u2019 if there ain\u2019t anything there, what\u2019s\nthe idee of my takin\u2019 a third!\u201d\n\nBenton said nothing more. Argument seemed such a futile thing, so\nfar as Murtry was concerned. Five minutes passed and Murtry\u2019s man\nappeared empty handed. His manner was apologetic.\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t there,\u201d he said, whining. \u201cAn\u2019 there ain\u2019t any on the\nboat. Sam or some of the other boys must\u2019ve used it all up last fall\nbefore the boat was laid up. I don\u2019t know what to do unless I mush\nup there an\u2019 have the boys come down in a boat or on a raft.\u201d\n\nFor almost a minute, Murtry raved like a maniac. \u201cAn\u2019 ev\u2019ry day that\nmy men stay up there, it\u2019s costin\u2019 me a hunderd an\u2019 sixty-five\ndollars.\u201d He groaned. \u201cFifteen men at ten a day an\u2019 my foreman at\nfifteen a day. That\u2019s what comes of puttin\u2019 a man like you in charge\nof my boat. Say, how long do you think it\u2019d take you to mush up\nthere?\u201d\n\n\u201cA hunderd an\u2019 fifty miles is a good ways--goin\u2019 through the brush\nlike I\u2019ll have to do,\u201d the man said. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best though to make\nit in ten days.\u201d\n\n\u201cSixteen hunderd an\u2019 sixty-five dollars!\u201d Again Murtry groaned. \u201cAn\u2019\nmaybe a whole lot more--if you _don\u2019t_ make it in ten days. Well,\nwhat are you standin\u2019 there for? Get a move on!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait just a minute, Mr. Murtry. I\u2019ve just thought about somethin\u2019\nthat may save you a whole lot of money, an\u2019 save me that long trip\nupriver on foot. An old-timer over on Penny Ante Crick has been\ntellin\u2019 all around that this young Benton sledded in nearly five\ngallons of oil last winter. He was laughin\u2019 about him usin\u2019 it to\ngrease his sled runners, an\u2019 he\u2019s got upward of four gallons of it\nleft. Now, if you could buy it off him----\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, of course,\u201d Murtry interrupted briskly. \u201cI heard about it a\nmonth ago. Just forgot it.\u201d He turned to Benton. \u201cHow much do you\nwant for that oil?\u201d he asked in a pleasant voice.\n\nYoung Benton was thinking fast. He, too, had forgotten all about the\noil that he had bought to make slippin\u2019 easy. He had considered the\nstuff worthless, but now----\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Mr. Murtry,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cI had a lot of\nwork sledding that oil in here last winter. I really hadn\u2019t thought\nabout selling it, but since you need it, and I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll let you\nhave it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean for nothin\u2019?\u201d Murtry asked incredulously.\n\n\u201cOf course not. I mean for a fair price.\u201d\n\nMurtry became suspicious. \u201cWhat do you call a fair price?\u201d he\ncountered. \u201cIt\u2019s worth nothin\u2019 whatever to you, an\u2019 I\u2019ll give\nyou--let\u2019s see, I\u2019ll give you two dollars a gallon for it an\u2019 allow\nyou a dollar a pound for freightin\u2019 it into the country. Fair\nenough, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nBenton grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s one way of looking at it,\u201d he said amiably,\n\u201cbut I really can\u2019t think of letting it go for what you offer. Two\ndollars a gallon is more than the oil is worth, but--the freighting\nthe stuff into this country. Man, that was the hardest work I ever\ndid in my life!\u201d\n\n\u201cI get you.\u201d Murtry spoke thickly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me where the wool\u2019s\nshort an\u2019 you aim to gouge me. All right--tell you what I\u2019ll\ndo--I\u2019ll give you a hundred dollars cash on the nail. How \u2019bout it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat _would_ be gouging, as you call it.\u201d Benton seemed to be\nconsidering the matter. \u201cNo,\u201d he said at last, \u201cI can\u2019t take that\nmuch money. Four gallons of oil isn\u2019t worth a hundred dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, what in thunder are you drivin\u2019 at?\u201d Murtry cried angrily.\n\u201cAre you tryin\u2019 to kid somebody?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all. You\u2019ve made your offer, and now I\u2019ll make mine.\u201d Benton\nspoke slowly and distinctly. \u201cAs you said a moment ago, that oil is\nreally worth nothing at all to me, so I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do.\nI\u2019ll just give you the oil, provided that you\u2019ll give me something\nthat\u2019s worth nothing whatever to you. In case you don\u2019t know, I mean\na sluice head of water from Caribou Creek. Are you on?\u201d\n\nMurtry was thinking hard. There was not one chance in a thousand of\nthis confident youngster finding gold on that little dry gulch.\nThere was water to spare, lots of it going to waste, but oil--there\nwas only four gallons of lubricating oil in the country! With a\nscowl, Murtry nodded his head in the affirmative.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a month later before the old-timer visited young Benton on\nhis dry gulch. Fully a half dozen men were bustling about on the\nclaim. Benton himself was closely watching two men who were holding\nthe nozzle of a pressure hose trained against a bank of gravel. The\nold-timer stood aghast until Benton came over to greet him.\n\n\u201cWell, how in the name of Sam Hill,\u201d said the old man, \u201cdid you ever\nmake a deal with Joe Murtry to get this water!\u201d\n\nFor reply Benton fished a bit of paper from his pocket, and passed\nit over. \u201cRead it,\u201d he said with a grin.\n\nThe old-timer slowly spelled out the brief document.\n\n    In consideration of four gallons of engine oil, I hereby\n    agree to sell, assign, and transfer to Harris Benton,\n    a full sluice head of water to be taken from the waters\n    of Caribou Creek, and I agree to allow him or his agents\n    to go on my claim or claims to dig the necessary ditch\n    to carry said water.\n\n                                                  Joe Murtry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the first man that ever got the best of Joe Murtry,\u201d gasped\nthe old-timer. \u201cHow in thunder did you do it?\u201d\n\nBenton explained.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d he went on, \u201cI\u2019ve got some good miners working for me,\nbut--you\u2019re an old-timer--do they seem to be working the ground all\nright?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, son,\u201d said the old-timer solemnly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need the\nadvice of an old-timer.\u201d",
