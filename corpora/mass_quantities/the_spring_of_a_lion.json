    "body": "The story which is narrated in the following pages came to me from\nthe lips of my old friend Allan Quatermain, or Hunter Quatermain, as\nwe used to call him in South Africa.  He told it to me one evening\nwhen I was stopping with him at the place he bought in Yorkshire.\nShortly after that, the death of his only son so unsettled him that\nhe immediately left England, accompanied by two companions, who were\nold fellow-voyagers of his, Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good, and\nhas now utterly vanished into the dark heart of Africa.  He is\npersuaded that a white people, of whom he has heard rumors all his\nlife, exists somewhere on the highlands in the vast, still unexplored\ninterior, and his great ambition is to find them before he dies.\nThis is the wild quest upon which he and his companions have\ndeparted, and from which I shrewdly suspect they never will return.\nOne letter only have I received from the old gentleman, dated from a\nmission station high up the Tana, a river on the east coast, about\nthree hundred miles north of Zanzibar; in it he says they have gone\nthrough many hardships and adventures, but are alive and well, and\nhave found traces which go far toward making him hope that the\nresults of their wild quest may be a \"magnificent and unexampled\ndiscovery.\"  I greatly fear, however, that all he has discovered is\ndeath; for this letter came a long while ago, and nobody has heard a\nsingle word of the party since.  They have totally vanished.\n\nIt was on the last evening of my stay at his house that he told the\nensuing story to me and Captain Good, who was dining with him.  He\nhad eaten his dinner and drunk two or three glasses of old port, just\nto help Good and myself to the end of the second bottle.  It was an\nunusual thing for him to do, for he was a most abstemious man, having\nconceived, as he used to say, a great horror of drink from observing\nits effects upon the class of men--hunters, transport riders, and\nothers--among whom he had passed so many years of his life.\nConsequently, the good wine took more effect on him than it would\nhave done on most men, sending a little flush into his wrinkled\ncheeks, and making him talk more freely than usual.\n\nDear old man!  I can see him now, as he went limping up and down the\nvestibule, with his gray hair sticking up in scrubbing-brush fashion,\nhis shrivelled yellow face, and his large dark eyes, that were as\nkeen as any hawk's and yet soft as a buck's.  The whole room was hung\nwith trophies of his numerous hunting expeditions, and he had some\nstory about every one of them, if only you could get him to tell\nthem.  Generally he would not, for he was not very fond of narrating\nhis own adventures, but to-night the port wine made him more\ncommunicative.\n\n\"Ah, you brute!\" he said, stopping beneath an unusually large skull\nof a lion, which was fixed just over the mantelpiece, beneath a long\nrow of guns, its jaws distended to their utmost width.  \"Ah, you\nbrute! you have given me a lot of trouble for the last dozen years,\nand will, I suppose, to my dying day.\"\n\n\"Tell us the yarn, Quatermain,\" said Good.  \"You have often promised\nto tell me, and have not.\"\n\n\"You had better not ask me to,\" he answered, \"for it is a longish\none.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said, \"the evening is young, and there is some more\nport.\"\n\nThus adjured, he filled his pipe from a jar of coarse-cut Boer\ntobacco that was always standing on the mantelpiece, and still\nwalking up and down the room, began:\n\n\"It was, I think, in the March of 1869 that I was up in Sikukuni's\ncountry.  It was just after old Sequati's time, and Sikukuni had got\ninto power--I forget how.  Any way, I was there.  I had heard that\nthe Bapedi people had got down an enormous quantity of ivory from the\ninterior, and so I started with a wagon-load of goods, and came\nstraight away from Middelburg to try and trade some of it.  It was a\nrisky thing to go into the country so early, on account of the fever,\nbut I knew that there were one or two others after that lot of ivory,\nso I determined to have a try for it, and take my chance of fever.  I\nhad got so tough from continual knocking about that I did not set it\ndown at much.  Well, I got on all right for awhile.  It is a\nwonderfully beautiful piece of bush veldt, with great ranges of\nmountains running through it, and round granite koppies starting up\nhere and there, looking out like sentinels over the rolling waste of\nbush.  But it is very hot--hot as a stew-pan--and when I was there\nthat March, which, of course, is autumn in that part of Africa, the\nwhole place reeked of fever.  Every morning, as I trekked along down\nby the Oliphant River, I used to creep out of the wagon at dawn and\nlook out.  But there was no river to be seen--only a long line of\nbillows of what looked like the finest cotton wool tossed up lightly\nwith a pitchfork.  It was the fever mist.  Out from among the scrub,\ntoo, came little spirals of vapor, as though there were hundreds of\ntiny fires alight in it--reek rising from thousands of tons of\nrotting vegetation.  It was a beautiful place, but the beauty was the\nbeauty of death; and all those lines and blots of vapor wrote one\ngreat word cross the surface of the country, and that word was\n'fever.'\n\n\"It was a dreadful year of illness, that.  I came, I remember, to one\nlittle kraal of Knobnoses, and went up to see if I could get some\n_maas_ (curdled buttermilk) and a few mealies.  As I got near, I was\nstruck with the silence of the place.  No children began to chatter,\nand no dogs barked.  Nor could I see any native sheep or cattle.  The\nplace, though it had evidently been recently inhabited, was as still\nas the bush round it, and some guinea fowl got up out of the prickly\npear bushes right at the kraal gate.  I remember that I hesitated a\nlittle before going in, there was such an air of desolation about the\nspot.  Nature never looks desolate when man has not yet laid his hand\nupon her breast; she is only lonely.  But when man has been and has\npassed away, then she looks desolate.\n\n\"Well, I passed into the kraal, and went up to the principal hut.  In\nfront of the hut was something with an old sheepskin _kaross_ (rug)\nthrown over it.  I stooped down and threw off the rug, and then\nshrank back amazed, for under it was the body of a young woman,\nrecently dead.  For a moment I thought of turning back, but my\ncuriosity overcame me; so going past the woman, I went down on my\nhands and knees and crept into the hut.  It was so dark that I could\nnot see anything, though I could smell a great deal--so I lit a\nmatch.  It was a 'tand-stickor' match, and burnt slowly and dimly,\nand as the light gradually increased I made out what I thought was a\nlot of people, men, women, and children, fast asleep.  Presently it\nburnt up brightly, and I saw that they, too, five of them altogether,\nwere quite dead.  One was a baby.  I dropped the match in a hurry,\nand was making my way out of the hut as hard as I could go, when I\ncaught sight of two bright eyes staring out of a corner.  Thinking it\nwas a wildcat or some such animal, I redoubled my haste, when\nsuddenly a voice near the eyes began first to mutter, and then to\nsend up a succession of awful yells.  Hastily I lit another match,\nand perceived that the eyes belonged to an old woman, wrapped up in a\ngreasy leather garment.  Taking her by the arm, I dragged her out,\nfor she could not, or would not, come by herself, and the stench was\noverpowering me.  Such a sight as she was--a bag of bones, covered\nover with black, shrivelled parchment.  The only white thing about\nher was her wool, and she seemed to be pretty well dead except for\nher eyes and her voice.  She thought that I was a devil come to take\nher, and that is why she yelled so.  Well, I got her down to the\nwagon, and gave her a \"tot\" of Cape smoke, and then, as soon as it\nwas ready, poured about a pint of beef-tea down her throat, made from\nthe flesh of a blue vilderbeeste I had killed the day before, and\nafter that she brightened up wonderfully.  She could talk\nZulu--indeed, it turned out that she had run away from Zululand in\nT'Chaka's time--and she told me that all the people that I had seen\nhad died of fever.  When they had died, the other inhabitants of the\nkraal had taken the cattle and gone away, leaving the poor old woman,\nwho was helpless from age and infirmity, to perish of starvation or\ndisease, as the case might be.  She had been sitting there for three\ndays among the bodies when I found her.  I took her on to the next\nkraal, and gave the headman a blanket to look after her, promising\nhim another if I found her well when I came back.  I remember that he\nwas much astonished at my parting with two blankets for the sake of\nsuch a worthless old creature.  'Why did I not leave her in the\nbush?' he asked.  Those people carry the doctrine of the survival of\nthe fittest to its extreme, you see.\n\n\"It was the night after I had got rid of the old woman that I made my\nfirst acquaintance with my friend yonder,\" and he nodded toward the\nskull that seemed to be grinning down at us in the shadow of the wide\nmantelshelf.  \"I had trekked from dawn till eleven o'clock--a long\ntrek--but I wanted to get on; and then had the oxen turned out to\ngraze, sending the voorlooper to look after them, meaning to inspan\nagain about six o'clock, and trek with the moon till ten.  Then I got\ninto the wagon and had a good sleep till half-past two or so in the\nafternoon, when I got up and cooked some meat, and had my dinner,\nwashing it down with a pannikin of black coffee--for it was difficult\nto get preserved milk in those days.  Just as I had finished, and the\ndriver, a man called Tom, was washing up the things, in comes the\nyoung scoundrel of a voorlooper driving one ox before him.\n\n\"'Where are the other oxen?' I asked.\n\n\"'Koos!' he said, 'Koos! (chief), the other oxen have gone away.  I\nturned my back for a minute, and when I looked round again, they were\nall gone except Kaptein here, who was rubbing his back against a\ntree.'\n\n\"'You mean that you have been asleep, and let them stray, you\nvillain.  I will rub your back against a stick,' I answered, feeling\nvery angry, for it was not a pleasant prospect to be stuck up in that\nfever trap for a week or so while we were hunting for the oxen.  'Off\nyou go, and you too, Tom, and mind you don't come back till you have\nfound them.  They have trekked back along the Middelburg Road, and\nare a dozen miles off by now, I'll be bound.  Now, no words; go, both\nof you.'\n\n\"Tom, the driver, swore and caught the lad a hearty kick, which he\nrichly deserved, and then, having tied old Kaptein up to the\ndisselboom with a reim, they got their assegais and sticks and\nstarted.  I would have gone too, only I knew that somebody must look\nafter the wagon, and I did not like to leave either of the boys with\nit at night.  I was in a very bad temper indeed, although I was\npretty well used to these sort of occurrences, and soothed myself by\ntaking a rifle and going to kill something.  For a couple of hours I\npoked about without seeing anything that I could get a shot at, but\nat last just as I was again within seventy yards of the wagon, I put\nup an old Impala ram from behind a mimosa thorn.  He ran straight for\nthe wagon, and it was not till he was passing within a few feet of it\nthat I could get a decent shot at him.  Then I pulled, and caught him\nhalfway down the spine; over he went, dead as a doornail, and a\npretty shot it was, though I ought not to say it.  This little\nincident put me into rather a better temper, especially as the buck\nhad rolled over right against the after part of the wagon, so I had\nonly to gut him, fix a reim round his legs, and haul him up.  By the\ntime I had done this the sun was down, and the full moon was up, and\na beautiful moon it was.  And then there came down that wonderful\nhush that sometimes falls over the African bush in the early hours of\nthe night.  No beast was moving, and no bird called.  Not a breath of\nair stirred the quiet trees, and the shadows did not even quiver;\nthey only grew.  It was very oppressive and very lonely, for there\nwas not a sign of the cattle or the boys.  I was quite thankful for\nthe society of old Kaptein, who was lying down contentedly against\nthe disselboom, chewing the cud with a good conscience.\n\n\"Presently, however, Kaptein began to get restless.  First he\nsnorted, then he got up and snorted again.  I could not make it out,\nso like a fool I got down off the wagon-box to have a look round,\nthinking it might be the lost oxen coming.\n\n\"Next instant I regretted it, for all of a sudden I heard an awful\nroar and saw something yellow flash past me and light on poor\nKaptein.  Then came a bellow of agony from the ox, and a crunch as\nthe lion put his teeth through the poor brute's neck, and I began to\nrealize what had happened.  My rifle was in the wagon, and my first\nthought was to get hold of it, and I turned and made a bolt for it.\nI got my foot on the wheel and flung my body forward on to the wagon,\nand there I stopped as if I was frozen, and no wonder, for as I was\nabout to spring up I heard the lion behind me, and next second I felt\nthe brute--ay, as plainly as I can feel this table--I felt him, I\nsay, sniffing at my left leg that was hanging down.\n\n\"My word!  I did feel queer; I don't think that I ever felt so queer\nbefore.  I dared not move for the life of me, and the odd thing was\nthat I seemed to lose power over my leg, which had an insane sort of\ninclination to kick out of its own mere motion--just as hysterical\npeople want to laugh when they ought to be particularly solemn.\nWell, the lion sniffed and sniffed, beginning at my ankle and slowly\nnosing away up to my thigh.  I thought that he was going to get hold\nthen, but he did not.  He only growled softly, and went back to the\nox.  Shifting my head a little I got a full view of him.  He was the\nbiggest lion I ever saw--and I have seen a great many--and he had a\nmost tremendous black mane.  What his teeth were like you can\nsee--look there, pretty big ones, ain't they?  Altogether he was a\nmagnificent animal, and as I lay there sprawling on the fore-tongue\nof the wagon, it occurred to me that he would look uncommonly well in\na cage.  He stood there by the carcass of poor Kaptein, and\ndeliberately disemboweled him as neatly as a butcher could have done.\nAll this while I dared not move, for he kept lifting his head and\nkeeping an eye on me as he lifted his bloody chops.  When he had\ncleaned Kaptein out, he opened his mouth and roared, and I am not\nexaggerating when I say that the sound shook the wagon.  Instantly\nthere came back an answering roar.\n\n\"'Heavens!' I thought, 'there is his mate!'\n\n\"Hardly was the thought out of my head when I caught sight in the\nmoonlight of the lioness bounding along through the long grass, and\nafter her a couple of cubs about the size of mastiffs.  She stopped\nwithin a few feet of my head, and stood and waved her tail, and fixed\nme with her glowing yellow eyes; but just as I thought that all was\nover, she turned, and began to feed on Kaptein, and so did the cubs.\nThere were the four of them within eight feet of me, growling and\nquarreling, rending and tearing and crunching poor Kaptein's bones;\nand there I lay, shaking with terror, and the cold perspiration\npouring out of me, feeling like another Daniel come to judgment, in a\nnew sense of the phrase.  Presently the cubs had eaten their fill,\nand began to get restless.  One went round to the back of the wagon\nand pulled at the Impala buck that hung there, and the other came\nround my way and began the sniffing game at my leg.  Indeed, he did\nmore than that, for, my trousers being hitched up a little, he began\nto lick the bare skin with his rough tongue.  The more he licked, the\nmore he liked it, to judge from his increased vigor and the loud\npurring noise he made.  Then I knew that the end had come, for in\nanother second his file-like tongue would have rasped through the\nskin of my leg--which was luckily pretty tough--and have got to the\nblood, and then there would be no chance for me.  So I just lay there\nand thought of my sins, and prayed to the Almighty, and thought that,\nafter all, life was a very enjoyable thing.\n\n\"And then all of a sudden I heard a crashing of bushes, and the\nshouting and whistling of men, and there were the two boys coming\nback with the cattle which they had found trekking along all\ntogether.  The lions lifted their heads and listened, and then\nwithout a sound bounded off--and I fainted.\n\n\"The lions came back no more that night, and by the next morning my\nnerves had got pretty straight again; but I was full of wrath when I\nthought of all that I had gone through at the hands, or rather noses,\nof those four lions, and of the fate of my after ox Kaptein.  He was\na splendid ox, and I was very fond of him.  So wroth was I that, like\na fool, I determined to go for the whole family of them.  It was\nworthy of a greenhorn out on his first hunting trip; but I did it,\nnevertheless.  Accordingly, after breakfast, having rubbed some oil\nupon my leg, which was very sore from the cub's tongue, I took the\ndriver, Tom, who did not half like the job, and having armed myself\nwith an ordinary double No. 12 smoothbore, the first breechloader I\never had, I started.  I took the smoothbore because it shot a bullet\nvery well; and my experience has been that a round ball from a\nsmoothbore is quite as effective against a lion as an express bullet.\nThe lion is soft, and not a difficult animal to finish if you hit him\nanywhere in the body.  A buck takes far more killing.\n\n\"Well, I started, and the first thing I set to work to do was to try\nto make out whereabouts the brutes lay up for the day.  About three\nhundred yards from the wagon was the crest of a rise covered with\nsingle mimosa trees, dotted about in a park-like fashion, and beyond\nthis was a stretch of open plain running down to a dry pan, or\nwaterhole, which covered about an acre of ground, and was densely\nclothed with reeds, now in the sere and yellow leaf.  From the\nfurther edge of this pan the ground sloped up again to a great cleft,\nor nullah, which had been out out by the action of water and was\npretty thickly sprinkled with bush, among which grew some large\ntrees, I forget of what sort.\n\n\"It at once struck me that the dry pan would be a likely place to\nfind my friends in, as there is nothing a lion is fonder of than\nlying up in reeds, through which he can see things without being seen\nhimself.  Accordingly thither I went and prospected.  Before I had\ngot halfway round the pan I found the remains of a blue vilderbeeste,\nthat had evidently been killed within the last three or four days and\npartially devoured by lions; and from other indications about I was\nsoon assured that, if the family were not in the pan that day, they\nspent a good deal of their spare time there.  But if there, the\nquestion was how to get them out; for it was clearly impossible to\nthink of going in after them unless one was quite determined to\ncommit suicide.  Now, there was a strong wind blowing from the\ndirection of the wagon, across the reedy pan toward the bush-clad\nkloof, or donga, and this first gave me the idea of firing the reeds,\nwhich, as I think I told you, were pretty dry.  Accordingly, Tom took\nsome matches and began starting little fires to the left, and I did\nthe same to the right.  But the reeds were still green at the bottom,\nand we should never have got them well alight had it not been for the\nwind, which got stronger and stronger as the sun got higher, and\nforced the fire into them.  At last, after half an hour's trouble,\nthe flame got a hold, and began to spread out like a fan, whereupon I\ngot round to the farther side of the pan to wait for the lions,\nstanding well out in the open, as we stood at the copse to-day where\nyou shot the woodcock.  It was a rather risky thing to do, but I used\nto be so sure of my shooting in those days that I did not so much\nmind the risk.  Scarcely had I got round when I heard the reeds\nparting before the onward rush of some animal.  'Now for it,' said I.\nOn it came.  I could see that it was yellow, and prepared for action,\nwhen, instead of a lion, out bounded a beautiful reit-bok, which had\nbeen lying in the shelter of the pan.  It must, by the way, have been\na reit-bok of a peculiarly confiding nature to lay itself down with\nthe lion like the lamb of prophecy, but, I suppose that the reeds\nwere thick, and that it kept a long way off.\n\n\"Well, I let the reit-bok go, and it went like the wind, and I kept\nmy eyes fixed upon the reeds.  The fire was burning like a furnace\nnow; the flames crackling and roaring as they bit into the reeds,\nsending spouts of fire twenty feet and more into the air, and making\nthe hot air dance above it in a way that was perfectly dazzling.  But\nthe reeds were still half-green, and created an enormous quantity of\nsmoke, which came rolling toward me like a curtain, lying very low on\naccount of the wind.  Presently, above the crackling of the fire, I\nheard a startled roar, then another and another.  So the lions were\nat home.\n\n\"I was beginning to get excited now, for, as you fellows know, there\nis nothing in experience to warm up your nerves like a lion at close\nquarters, unless it is a wounded buffalo; and I got still more so\nwhen I made out through the smoke that the lions were all moving\nabout on the extreme edge of the reeds.  Occasionally they would pop\ntheir heads out like rabbits from a burrow, and then, catching sight\nof me standing about fifty yards out, draw them back again.  I knew\nthat it must be getting pretty warm behind them, and that they could\nnot keep the game up for long; and I was not mistaken, for suddenly\nall four of them broke cover together, the old black-maned lion\nleading by a few yards.  I never saw a more splendid sight in all my\nhunting experience than those four lions bounding across the veldt,\novershadowed by the dense pall of smoke and backed by the fiery\nfurnace of the burning reeds.\n\n\"I reckoned that they would pass, on their road to the bushy kloof,\nwithin about twenty-five yards of me, so, taking a long breath, I got\nmy gun well on to the lion's shoulder--the black-maned one--so as to\nallow for an inch or two of motion, and catch him through the heart.\nI was on, dead on, and my finger was just beginning to tighten on the\ntrigger, when suddenly I went blind--a bit of reed-ash had drifted\ninto my right eye.  I danced and rubbed, and got it more or less\nclear just in time to see the tail of the last lion vanishing round\nthe bushes up the kloof.\n\n\"If ever a man was mad, I was that man.  It was too bad; and such a\nshot in the open, too!  However, I was not going to be beaten, so I\njust turned and marched for the kloof.  Tom, the driver, begged and\nimplored me not to go, but though as a general rule I never pretended\nto be very brave (which I am not), I was determined that I would\neither kill those lions or they should kill me.  So I told Tom that\nhe need not come unless he liked, but I was going; and being a plucky\nfellow, a Swazi by birth, he shrugged his shoulders, muttered that I\nwas mad or bewitched, and followed doggedly in my tracks.\n\n\"We soon got to the kloof, which was about three hundred yards in\nlength and but sparsely wooded, and then the real fun began.  There\nmight be a lion behind every bush--there certainly were four lions\nsomewhere; the delicate question was where.  I peeped and poked and\nlooked in every possible direction, with my heart in my mouth, and\nwas at last rewarded by catching a glimpse of something yellow moving\nbehind a bush.  At the same moment, from another bush opposite me out\nburst one of the cubs and galloped back toward the burnt-out pan.  I\nwhipped round and let drive a snapshot that tipped him head over\nheels, breaking his back within two inches of the root of the tail,\nand there he lay, helpless but glaring.  Tom afterward killed him\nwith his assegai.  I opened the breech of the gun, and hurriedly\npulled out the old case, which, to judge from what ensued, must, I\nsuppose, have burst and left a portion of its fabric sticking to the\nbarrel.  At any rate, when I tried to get in the new case it would\nonly enter halfway; and--would you believe it?--this was the moment\nthat the lioness, attracted, no doubt, by the outcry of her cub,\nchose to put in an appearance.  There she stood, twenty paces or so\nfrom me, lashing her tail, and looking just as wicked as it is\npossible to conceive.  Slowly I stepped backward, trying to push in\nthe new case, and as I did so, she moved on in little runs, dropping\ndown after each run.  The danger was imminent, and the case would not\ngo in.  At the moment I oddly enough thought of the cartridge-maker\nwhose name I will not mention, and earnestly hoped that, if the\nlioness got me, some condign punishment would overtake him.  It would\nnot go in, so I tried to pull it out.  It would not come out, either,\nand my gun was useless if I could not shut it to use the other\nbarrel.  I might as well have had no gun.  Meanwhile I was walking\nbackward, keeping my eye on the lioness, who was creeping forward on\nher belly without a sound, but lashing her tail and keeping her eye\non me; and in it I saw that she was coming in a few seconds more.  I\ndashed my wrist and the palm of my hand against the brass rim of the\ncartridge till the blood poured from them--look, there are the scars\nof it to this day!\"\n\nHere Quatermain held up his right hand to the light, and showed us\nseven or eight white cicatrices just where the wrist is set into the\nhand.\n\n\"But it was not of the slightest use,\" he went on; \"the cartridge\nwould not move.  I only hope that no other man will ever be put in\nsuch an awful position.  The lioness gathered herself together, and I\ngave myself up for lost, when suddenly Tom shouted out from somewhere\nin my rear:\n\n\"'You are walking on to the wounded cub; turn to the right.'\n\n\"I had the sense, dazed as I was, to take the hint, and slewing round\nat right-angles, but still keeping my eyes on the lioness, I\ncontinued my backward walk.\n\n\"To my intense relief, with a low growl she straightened herself,\nturned, and bounded off further up the kloof.\n\n\"'Come on, Inkoos,' said Tom, 'let's get back to the wagon.'\n\n\"'All right, Tom,' I answered.  'I will when I have killed those\nthree other lions,' for by this time I was bent on shooting them as I\nnever remember being bent on anything before or since.  'You can go\nif you like, or you can get up a tree.'\n\n\"He considered the position a little, and then he very wisely got up\na tree.  I wish that I had done the same.\n\n\"Meanwhile I had got out my knife, which had an extractor in it, and\nsucceeded after some difficulty in hauling out the case which had so\nnearly been the cause of my death, and removing the obstruction in\nthe barrel.  It was very little thicker than a postage-stamp;\ncertainly not thicker than a piece of writing-paper.  This done, I\nloaded the gun, bound my handkerchief round my wrist and hand to\nstanch the flowing of the blood, and started on again.\n\n\"I had noticed that the lioness went back into a thick green bush, or\nrather cluster of bushes, growing near the water, for there was a\nlittle stream running down the kloof, about fifty yards higher up,\nand for this I made.  When I got there, however, I could see nothing,\nso I took up a big stone and threw it into the bushes.  I believe\nthat it hit the other cub, for out it came with a rush, giving me a\nbroadside shot, of which I promptly availed myself, knocking it over\ndead.  Out, too, came the lioness like a flash of light, but quick as\nshe went, I managed to put the other bullet into her ribs, so that\nshe rolled right over three times like a shot rabbit.  I instantly\ngot two more cartridges into the gun, and as I did so, the lioness\ngot up again and came crawling toward me on her fore-paws, roaring\nand groaning, and with such an expression of diabolical fury on her\ncountenance as I have not often seen.  I shot her again through the\nchest, and she fell over on to her side quite dead.\n\n\"That was the first and last time that I ever killed a brace of lions\nright and left, and, what is more, I never heard of anybody else\ndoing it.  Naturally I was considerably pleased with myself, and\nhaving again loaded up, went on to look for the black-maned beauty\nwhich had killed Kaptein.  Slowly and with the greatest care I\nproceeded up the kloof, searching every bush and tuft of grass as I\nwent.  It was wonderfully exciting work, for I never was sure from\none moment to another but that he would be on me.  I took comfort,\nhowever, from the reflection that a lion rarely attacks a\nman--rarely, I say; sometimes he does, as you will see--unless he is\ncornered or wounded.\n\n\"I must have been out for nearly an hour hunting after the lion.\nOnce I thought I saw something move in a clump of tambouki grass, but\nI could not be sure, and when I trod out the grass I could not find\nhim.\n\n\"At last I got up to the head of the kloof, which made a cul-de-sac.\nIt was formed of a wall of rock about fifty feet high.  Down this\nrock trickled a little waterfall, and in front of it, some seventy\nfeet from its face, was a great piled-up mass of bowlders, in the\ncrevices and on the top of which grew ferns and grass and stunted\nbushes.  This mass was about twenty-five feet high.  The sides of the\nkloof here were also very steep.  Well, I got up to the top of the\nnullah and looked all around.  No signs of the lion.  Evidently I had\neither overlooked him further down, or he had escaped right away.  It\nwas very vexatious; but still three lions were not a bad bag for one\ngun before dinner, and I was fain to be content.  Accordingly I\ndeparted back again, making my way round the isolated pillar of\nbowlders, and beginning to feel that I was pretty well done up with\nexcitement and fatigue, and should be more so before I had skinned\nthose three lions.  When I had got, as nearly as I could judge, about\neighteen yards past the pillar or mass of bowlders, I turned to have\nanother look round.  I have a pretty sharp eye, but I could see\nnothing at all.\n\n\"Then, on a sudden, I saw something sufficiently alarming, On the top\nof the mass of bowlders opposite to me, standing out clear against\nthe rock beyond, was the huge black-maned lion.  He had been\ncrouching there, and now arose as though by magic.  There he stood,\nlashing his tail, just like a statue of the animal on the gateway of\nNorthumberland House that I have seen a picture of.  But he did not\nstand long.  Before I could fire--before I could do more than get the\ngun to my shoulder--he sprang straight up and out from the rock, and\ndriven by the impetus of that one mighty bound came hurtling through\nthe air toward me.\n\n\"Heavens! how grand he looked, and how awful!  High into the air he\nflew, describing a great arc.  Just as he touched the highest point\nof his spring I fired.  I did not dare to wait, for I saw that he\nwould clear the whole space and land right upon me.  Without a sight,\nalmost without aim, I fired as one would fire a snapshot at snipe.\nThe bullet told, for I distinctly heard its thud above the rushing\nsound caused by the passage of the lion through the air.  Next second\nI was swept to the ground (luckily I fell into a low creeper-clad\nbush, which broke the shock), and the lion was on the top of me, and\nthe next those great white teeth of his had met in my thigh--I heard\nthem grate against the bone, I yelled out in agony, for I did not\nfeel in the least benumbed and happy, like Dr. Livingstone--whom, by\nthe way, I knew very well--and gave myself up for dead.  But\nsuddenly, as I did so, the lion's grip on my thigh loosened, and he\nstood over me, swaying to and fro, his huge mouth, from which the\nblood was gushing, wide opened.  Then he roared, and the sound shook\nthe rocks.\n\n\"To and fro he swung, and suddenly the great head dropped on me,\nknocking all the breath from my body, and he was dead.  My bullet had\nentered in the center of his chest and passed out on the right side\nof the spine about halfway down the back.\n\n\"The pain of my wound kept me from fainting, and, as soon as I got my\nbreath, I managed to drag myself from under him.  Thank heavens! his\ngreat teeth had not crushed my thigh bone; but I was losing a great\ndeal of blood, and had it not been for the timely arrival of Tom,\nwith whose aid I got the handkerchief off my wrist and tied it round\nmy leg, twisting it tight with a stick, I think I should have bled to\ndeath.\n\n\"Well, it was a just reward for my folly in trying to tackle a family\nof lions single-handed.  The odds were too long.  I have been lame\never since, and shall be till my dying day; in the month of March the\nwound always troubles me a great deal, and every three years it\nbreaks out raw.  I need scarcely add that I never traded the lot of\nivory at Sikukuni's.  Another man got it--a German--and made five\nhundred pounds out of it, after paying expenses.  I spent the next\nmonth on the broad of my back, and was a cripple for six months after\nthat.  And now I've told you the yarn, so I will have a drop of\nHollands and go to bed.\"\n\n\n\nTHE END.\n",
