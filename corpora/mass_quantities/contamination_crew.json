Jenkins, Physician; First Court of Medical\nAffairs, final action pending._)\n\n COM COD S221VB73 VOROCHISLOV SECTOR; 4th GALACTIC PERIOD 22, 2341\n     GENERAL SURVEY SHIP MERCY TO HOSPITAL EARTH\n\n VIA: FASTEST POSSIBLE ROUTING, PRIORITY UNASSIGNED\n\n TO: Lucius Darby, Physician Grade I, Black Service Director of Galactic\n     Periphery Services, Hospital Earth\n\n FROM: Samuel B. Jenkins, Physician Grade VI, Red Service General\n     Practice Patrol Ship _Lancet_ (Attached GSS _Mercy_ pro tem)\n\nSIR: The following communication is directed to your attention in hopes\nthat it may anticipate various charges which are certain to be placed\nagainst me as a Physician of the Red Service upon the return of the\nGeneral Survey Ship _Mercy_ to Hospital Earth (expected arrival four\nmonths from above date).\n\nThese charges will undoubtedly be preferred by one Turvold Neelsen,\nPhysician Grade II of the Black Service, and Commander of the _Mercy_ on\nits current survey mission into the Vorochislov Sector. Exactly what the\ncharges will be I cannot say, since the Black Doctor in question refuses\neither audience or communication with me at the present time; however,\nit seems likely that treason, incompetence and mutinous insubordination\nwill be among the milder complaints registered. It is possible that even\nMalpractice might be added, so you can readily understand the reasons\nfor this statement--\n\nThe following will also clarify my attached request that the GSS\n_Mercy_, upon arrival in orbit around Hospital Earth, be met immediately\nby a decontamination ship carrying a vat of hydrochloric acid,\nconcentration 3.7%, measuring no less than twenty by thirty by fifty\nfeet, and that Quarantine officials be prepared to place the entire crew\nof the _Mercy_ under physical and psychiatric observation for a period\nof no less than six weeks upon disembarkation.\n\nThe facts, in brief, are as follows:\n\nThree months ago, as crew of the General Practice Patrol Ship _Lancet_,\nmy colleague Green Doctor Wallace Stone and myself began investigating\ncertain peculiar conditions existing on the fourth planet of Mauki,\nVorochislov Sector (Class I Medical Service Contract.) The entire\npopulation of that planet was found to be suffering from a mass\npsychotic delusion of rather spectacular proportions: namely, that they\nand their entire planet were in imminent danger of being devoured, in\ntoto, by an indestructible non-humanoid creature which they called a\n_hlorg_. The Maukivi were insistent that a _hlorg_ had already totally\nconsumed a non-existent outer planet in their system, and was now hard\nat work on neighboring Mauki V. It was their morbid fear that Mauki IV\nwas next on its list. No amount of reassurance could convince them of\nthe foolishness of these fears, although we exhausted our energy, our\npatience, and our food and medical supplies in the effort. Ultimately we\nreferred the matter to the Grey Service, feeling confident that it was a\npsychiatric problem rather than medical or surgical. We applied to the\nGSS _Mercy_ to take us aboard to replenish our ship's supplies, and\nprovide us a much-needed recovery period. The Black Doctor in command\napproved our request and brought us aboard.\n\nThe trouble began two days later....\n\n\n\nThere were three classes of dirty words in use by the men who travelled\nthe spaceways back and forth from Hospital Earth.\n\nThere were the words you seldom used in public, but which were colorful\nand descriptive in private use.\n\nThen there were the words which you seldom used even in private, but\nwhich effectively relieved feelings when directed at mirrors, inanimate\nobjects, and people who had just left the room.\n\nFinally, there were the words that you just didn't use, period. You knew\nthey existed; you'd heard them used at one time or another, but to hear\nthem spoken out in plain Earth-English was enough to rock the most\nspace-hardened of the Galactic Pill Peddlers back on his well-worn\nheels.\n\nBlack Doctor Turvold Neelsen's Earth-English was spotty at best, but the\nword came through without any possibility of misinterpretation. Red\nDoctor Sam Jenkins stared at the little man and felt his face turning as\nscarlet as the lining of his uniform cape.\n\n\"But that's ridiculous!\" he finally stammered. \"Quite aside from the\nlanguage you use to suggest it.\"\n\n\"Ah! So the word still has some punch left, eh? At least you puppies\nbring something away from your Medical Training, even if it's only\ntaboos.\" The Black Doctor scowled across the desk at Jenkins' lanky\nfigure. \"But sometimes, my good Doctor, it is better to face a fact than\nto wait for the fact to face you. Sometimes we have to crawl out of our\nivory towers for a minute or two--you know?\"\n\nJenkins reddened again. He had never had any great love for physicians\nof the Black Service--who did?--but he found himself disliking this\nshort, blunt-spoken man even more cordially than most. \"Why implicate\nthe _Lancet_?\" he burst out. \"You've landed the _Mercy_ on plenty of\nplanets before we brought the _Lancet_ aboard her--\"\n\n\"But we did not have it with us before the _Lancet_ came aboard, and we\ndo have it now. The implication is obvious. You have brought aboard a\ncontaminant.\"\n\nHe'd said it again.\n\nRed Doctor Jenkins' face darkened. \"The Green Doctor and I have\nmaintained the _Lancet_ in perfect conformity with the Sterility Code.\nWe've taken every precaution on both landing and disembarking\nprocedures. What's more, we've spent the last three months on a planet\nwith _no_ mutually compatible flora or fauna. From Hospital Earth\nviewpoint, Mauki IV is sterile. We made only the briefest check-stop on\nMauki V before joining you. It was a barren rock, but we decontaminated\nagain after leaving. If you have a--a _contaminant_ on board your ship,\nsir, it didn't come from the _Lancet_. And I won't be held responsible.\"\n\nIt was strong language to use to a Black Doctor, and Sam Jenkins knew\nit. There were doctors of the Green and Red Services who had spent their\nprofessional lives on some god-forsaken planetoid at the edge of the\nGalaxy for saying less. Red Doctor Sam Jenkins was too near the end of\nhis Internship, too nearly ready for his first Permanent Planetary\nAppointment with the rank, honor, and responsibility it carried to\nlightly risk throwing it to the wind at this stage--\n\nBut a Red Doctor does not bring a contaminant aboard a survey ship, he\nthought doggedly, no matter what the Black Doctor says--\n\nNeelsen looked at the young man slowly. Then he shrugged. \"Of course,\nI'm merely a pathologist. I realize that we know nothing of medicine,\nnor of disease, nor of the manner in which disease is spread. All this\nis beyond our scope. But perhaps you'll permit one simple question from\na dull old man, just to humor him.\"\n\nJenkins looked at the floor. \"I'm sorry, sir.\"\n\n\"Just so. You've had a very successful cruise this year with the\n_Lancet_, I understand.\"\n\nJenkins nodded.\n\n\"A most successful cruise. Four planets elevated from Class IV to Class\nII contracts, they tell me. Morua II elevated from Class VI to Class I,\nwith certain special riders. A plague-panic averted on Setman I, and a\nvery complex virus-bacteria symbiosis unravelled on Orb III. An\nillustrious record. You and your colleague from the Green Service are\nhoping for a year's exemption from training, I imagine--\" The Black\nDoctor looked up sharply. \"You searched your holds after leaving the\nMauki planets, I presume?\"\n\nJenkins blinked. \"Why--no, sir. That is, we decontaminated according\nto--\"\n\n\"I see. You didn't search your holds. I suppose you didn't notice your\nfood supplies dwindling at an alarming rate?\"\n\n\"No--\" The Red Doctor hesitated. \"Not really.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" The Black Doctor closed his eyes wearily and flipped an activator\nswitch. The scanner on the far wall buzzed into activity. It focussed on\nthe rear storage hold of the _Mercy_ where the little _Lancet_ was\nresting on its landing rack. \"Look closely, Doctor.\"\n\nAt first Jenkins saw nothing. Then his eye caught a long, pink\nglistening strand lying across the floor of the hold. The scanner picked\nup the strand, followed it to the place where it emerged from a neat\npencil-sized hole in the hull of the _Lancet_. The strand snaked\ncompletely across the room and disappeared through another neat hole in\nthe wall into the next storage hold.\n\nJenkins shook his head as the scanner flipped back to the hole in the\n_Lancet's_ hull. Even as he watched, the hole enlarged and a pink blob\nbegan to emerge. The blob kept coming and coming until it rested soggily\non the edge of the hole. Then it teetered and fell _splat_ on the floor.\n\n\"Friend of yours?\" the Black Doctor asked casually.\n\nIt was a pink heap of jelly just big enough to fill a scrub bucket. It\nsat on the floor, quivering noxiously. Then it sent out pseudopods in\nseveral directions, probing the metal floor. After a few moments it\nbegan oozing along the strand of itself that lay on the floor, and\nsqueezed through the hole into the next hold.\n\n\"Ugh,\" said Sam Jenkins, feeling suddenly sick.\n\n\"The hydroponic tanks are in there,\" the Black Doctor said. \"You've seen\none of those before?\"\n\n\"Not in person.\" Jenkins shook his head weakly. \"Only pictures. It's a\n_hlorg_. We thought it was only a Maukivi persecution fantasy.\"\n\n\"This thing is growing pretty fast for a persecution fantasy. We spotted\nit eight hours ago, demolishing what was left of your food supply. It's\ntwice as big now as it was then.\"\n\n\"Well, we've got to get rid of it,\" said Jenkins, suddenly coming to\nlife.\n\n\"Amen, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I'll get the survey crew alerted right away. We won't waste a minute.\nAnd my apologies.\" Jenkins was hurrying for the door. \"I'll get it\ncleared out of here fast.\"\n\n\"I do hope so,\" said the Black Doctor. \"The thing makes me ill just to\nthink about.\"\n\n\"I'll give you a clean-ship report in twenty-four hours,\" the Red Doctor\nsaid as confidently as he could and beat a hasty retreat down the\ncorridor. He was wishing fervently that he felt as confident as he\nsounded.\n\nThe Maukivi had described the _hlorg_ in excruciating detail. He and\nGreen Doctor Stone had listened, and smiled sadly at each other, day\nafter day, marvelling at the fanciful delusion. _Hlorgs_, indeed! And\nsuch creatures to dream up--eating, growing, devouring plant, animal and\nmineral without discrimination--\n\nAnd the Maukivi had stoutly maintained that this _hlorg_ of theirs was\nindestructible--\n\n\n\nGreen Doctor Wally Stone, true to his surgical calling, was a man of\naction.\n\n\"You mean there _is_ such a thing?\" he exploded when his partner\nconfronted him with the news. \"For real? Not just somebody's pipe\ndream?\"\n\n\"There is,\" said Jenkins, \"and we've got it. Here. On board the _Mercy_.\nIt's eating like hell-and-gone and doubling its size every eight hours.\"\n\n\"Well what are you waiting for? Toss it overboard!\"\n\n\"Fine! And what happens to the next party it happens to land on? We're\nsupposed to be altruists, remember? We're supposed to worry about the\nhealth of the Galaxy.\" Jenkins shook his head. \"Whatever we do with it,\nwe have to find out just what we're tossing before we toss.\"\n\nThe creature had made itself at home aboard the _Mercy_. In the spirit\nof uninvited guests since time immemorial, it had established a toehold\nwith remarkable asperity, and now was digging in for the long winter.\nDrawn to the hydroponic tanks like a flea to a dog, the _hlorg_ had\nsettled its bulbous pink body down in their murky depths with a\ncontented gurgle. As it grew larger the tank-levels grew lower, the\nbroth clearer.\n\nThe fact that the twenty-five crewmen of the _Mercy_ depended on those\ntanks for their food supply on the four-month run back to Hospital Earth\ndidn't seem to bother the _hlorg_ a bit. It just sank down wetly and\nbegan to eat.\n\nUnder Jenkins' whip hand, and with Green Doctor Stone's assistance, the\nSurvey Crew snapped into action. Survey was the soul and lifeblood of\nthe medical services supplied by Hospital Earth to the inhabited planets\nof the Galaxy. Centuries before, during the era of exploration, every\nEarth ship had carried a rudimentary Survey Crew--a physiologist, a\nbiochemist, an immunologist, a physician--to determine the safety of\nlandings on unknown planets. Other races were more advanced in\ntechnological and physical sciences, in sales or in merchandising--but\nin the biological sciences men of Earth stood unexcelled in the Galaxy.\nIt was not surprising that their casual offerings of medical services\nwherever their ships touched had led to a growing demand for those\nservices, until the first Medical Service Contract with Deneb III had\nformalized the planetary specialty. Earth had become Hospital Earth,\nphysician to a Galaxy, surgeon to a thousand worlds, midwife to those\nsusceptible to midwifery and psychiatrist to those whose inner lives\nzigged when their outer lives zagged.\n\nIn the early days it had been a haphazard arrangement; but gradually\ndistinct Services appeared to handle problems of medicine, surgery,\nradiology, psychiatry and all the other functions of a well-appointed\nmedical service. Under the direction of the Black Service of Pathology,\nHospital ships and Survey ships were dispatched to serve as bases for\nthe tiny General Practice Patrol ships that answered the calls of the\nplanets under Contract.\n\nBut it was the Survey ships that did the basic dirty-work on any new\nplanet taken under Contract--outlining the physiological and biochemical\naspects of the races involved, studying their disease patterns, their\nimmunological types, their susceptibility to medical, surgical, or\npsychiatric treatment. It was an exacting service to perform, and Survey\ndid an exacting job.\n\nNow, with their own home base invaded by a hungry pink jelly-blob, the\nSurvey Crew of the _Mercy_ dug in with all fours to find a way to\nexorcise it.\n\nThe early returns were not encouraging.\n\nBowman, the anatomist, spent six hours with the creature. He'd go after\nthe functional anatomy first, he thought, as he approached the task with\ngusto. Special organs, vital organ systems--after all, every Achilles\nhad his heel. Functional would spot it if anything would--\n\nSix hours later he rendered a preliminary report. It consisted of a\nblank sheet of paper and an expression of wild frustration.\n\n\"What's this supposed to mean?\" Jenkins asked.\n\n\"Just what it says.\"\n\n\"But it says nothing!\"\n\n\"That's exactly what it means.\" Bowman was a thin, wistful-looking man\nwith a hawk nose and a little brown mustache. He subbed as ship's cook\nwhen things were slow in his specialty. He wasn't a very good cook, but\nwhat could anyone do with the sludge from the harvest shelf of a\nhydroponic tank? Now, with the _hlorg_ incumbent, there wasn't even any\nsludge.\n\n\"I drained off a tank and got a good look at it before it crawled over\ninto the next one,\" Bowman said. \"Ugly bastard. But from a strictly\nanatomical standpoint I can't help you a bit.\"\n\nGreen Doctor Stone glowered over Jenkins' shoulder at the man. \"But\nsurely you can give us _something_.\"\n\nBowman shrugged. \"You want it technical?\"\n\n\"Any way you like.\"\n\n\"Your _hlorg_ is an ideal anamorph. A nothing. Protoplasm, just\nprotoplasm.\"\n\nJenkins looked up sharply. \"What about his cellular organization?\"\n\n\"No cells,\" said Bowman. \"Unless they're sub-microscopic, and I'd need\nan electron-peeker to tell you that.\"\n\n\"No organ systems?\"\n\n\"Not even an integument. You saw how slippery he looked? That's why.\nThere's nothing holding him in but energy.\"\n\n\"Now, look,\" said Stone. \"He eats, doesn't he? He must have waste\nmaterials of some sort.\"\n\nBowman shook his head unhappily. \"Sorry. No urates. No nitrates. No\nCO{2}. Anyway, he doesn't eat because he has nothing to eat with. He\nabsorbs. And that includes the lining of the tanks, which he seems to\nlike as much as the contents. He doesn't _bore_ those holes he makes--he\n_dissolves_ them.\"\n\nThey sent Bowman back to quarters for a hot bath and a shot of Happy-O\nand looked up Hrunta, the biochemist.\n\nHrunta was glaring at paper electrophoretic patterns and pulling out\nchunks of hair around his bald spot. He gave them a snarl and shoved a\nsheaf of papers into their hands.\n\n\"Metabolic survey?\" Jenkins asked.\n\n\"Plus,\" said Hrunta. \"You're not going to like it, either.\"\n\n\"Why not? If it grows, it metabolizes. If it metabolizes, we can kill\nit. Axiom number seventeen, paragraph number four.\"\n\n\"Oh, it metabolizes, all right, but you'd better find yourself another\naxiom, pretty quick.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because it not only metabolizes, it _consumes_. There's no sign of the\nusual protein-carbohydrate-fat metabolism going on here. This baby has\nan enzyme system that's straight from hell. It bypasses the usual\nmetabolic activities that produce heat and energy and gets right down to\nbasic-basic.\"\n\nJenkins swallowed. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"It attacks the nuclear structure of whatever matter the creature comes\nin contact with. There's a partial mass-energy conversion in its rawest\nform. The creature goes after carbon-bearing substances first, since the\nC seems to break down more easily than anything else--hence its\npreference for plant and animal material over non-C stuff. But it can\nuse anything if it has to--\"\n\nJenkins stared at the little biochemist, an image in his mind of the\npink creature in the hold, growing larger by the minute as it ate its\nway through the hydroponics, through the dry stores, through--\n\n\"Is there anything it _can't_ use?\"\n\n\"If there is, I haven't found it,\" Hrunta said sadly. \"In fact, I can't\nsee any reason why it couldn't consume this ship and everything in it,\nright down to the last rivet--\"\n\n\n\nThey walked down to the hold for another look at their uninvited guest,\nand almost wished they hadn't.\n\nIt had reached the size of a small hippopotamus, although the\nresemblance ended there. Twenty hours had elapsed since the survey had\nbegun. The _hlorg_ had used every minute of it, draining the tanks,\nengulfing dry stores, devouring walls and floors as it spread out in\nsearch of food, leaving trails of eroded metal wherever it went.\n\nIt was ugly--ugly in its pink shapelessness, ugly in its slimy\nhalf-sentient movements, in its very _purposefulness_. But its ugliness\nwent even deeper, stirring primordial feelings of revulsion and loathing\nin their minds as they watched it oozing implacably across the hold to\nanother dry-storage bin.\n\nWally Stone shuddered. \"It's _grown_.\"\n\n\"Too fast. Bowman charts it as geometric progression.\"\n\nStone scratched his jaw as a lone pink pseudopod pushed out on the floor\ntoward him. Then he leaped forward and stamped on it, severing the\nstrand from the body.\n\nThe severed member quivered and lay still for a moment. Then it flowed\nback to rejoin the body with a wet gurgle.\n\nStone looked at his half-dissolved shoe.\n\n\"Egotropism,\" Jenkins said. \"Bowman played around with that, too. A\nsevered piece will rejoin if it can. If it can't it just takes up\nindependent residence and we have two _hlorgs_.\"\n\n\"What happens to it outside the ship?\" Stone wanted to know.\n\n\"It falls dormant for several hours, and then splits up into a thousand\nindependent chunks. One of the boys spent half of yesterday out there\ngathering them up. I tell you, this thing is equipped to _survive_.\"\n\n\"So are we,\" said Green Doctor Stone grimly. \"If we can't outwit this\nfree-flowing gob of obscenity, we deserve anything we get. Let's have a\nconference.\"\n\nThey met in the pilot room. The Black Doctor was there; so were Bowman\nand Hrunta. Chambers, the physiologist, was glumly clasping and\nunclasping his hands in a corner. The geneticist, Piccione, drew symbols\non a scratch pad and stared blankly at the wall.\n\nJenkins was saying: \"Of course, these are only preliminary reports, but\nthey serve to outline the problem. This is not just an annoyance any\nlonger, it's a crisis. We'd all better understand that.\"\n\nThe Black Doctor cut him off with a wave of his hand, and glowered at\nthe papers as he read them through minutely. As he sat hunched at the\ndesk with the black cowl of his office hanging down from his shoulders\nhe looked like a squat black judge, Jenkins thought, a shadow from the\nInquisition, a Passer of Spells. But there was no medievalism in Black\nDoctor Neelsen. In fact, it was for that reason, and only that reason,\nthat the Black Service had come to be the leaders and the whips, the\nexecutors and directors of all the manifold operations of Hospital\nEarth.\n\n\n\nThe physicians of the General Practice Patrol were fledglings, newly\ntrained in their specialties, inexperienced in the rigorous discipline\nof medicine that was required of the directors of permanent Planetary\nDispensaries in the heavily populated systems of the Galaxy. On outlying\nworlds where little was known of the ways of medicine, the temptation\nwas great to substitute faith for knowledge, cant for investigation,\nnonsense rituals for hard work. But the physicians of the Black Service\nwere always waiting to jerk wandering neophytes back to the scientific\ndisciplines that made the service of Hospital Earth so effective. The\nBlack Doctors would not tolerate sloppiness. \"Show me the tissue,\nDoctor,\" they would say. \"Prove to me that what you say is so. Prove\nthat what you did was valid medicine....\" Their laboratories were the\nmorgues and autopsy rooms of a thousand planets, the Temples of Truth\nfrom which no physician since the days of Pasteur and Lister could\nescape for long and retain his position.\n\nThe Black Doctors were the pragmatists, the gadflies of Hospital Earth.\n\nFor this reason it was surprising to hear Black Doctor Neelsen saying,\n\"Perhaps we are being too scientific, just now. When the creature has\nexhausted our food stores, it will look elsewhere for food. Perhaps we\nmust cut at the tree and not at the root.\"\n\n\"A frontal attack?\" said Jenkins.\n\n\"Just so. Its enzyme system is its vulnerability. Enzyme systems operate\nunder specific optimum conditions, right? And every known enzyme system\ncan be inactivated by adverse conditions of one sort or another. A\nphysical approach may tell us how in this case. Meanwhile we will be on\nemergency rations, and hope that we don't starve to death finding out.\"\nThe Black Doctor paused, looking at the men around him. \"And in case you\nare thinking of enlisting help from outside, forget it. I've sent\nplague-warnings out for Galactic relay. We have this thing isolated, and\nwe're going to keep it that way as long as I command this ship.\"\n\nThey went gloomily back to their laboratories to plan their frontal\nattack.\n\nThat was the night that Hrunta disappeared.\n\n\n\nHe was gone when they came to wake him from his sleep period. His bunk\nhad been slept in, but he wasn't in it. In fact, he wasn't anywhere on\nthe ship.\n\n\"But he couldn't just vanish!\" the Black Doctor burst out when they told\nhim the news. \"Maybe he's hiding somewhere. Maybe this business was\nworking on his mind.\"\n\nGreen Doctor Stone took a crew of men to search the ship again, even\nthough he considered it a waste of precious time. He had his private\nconvictions about where Hrunta had gone.\n\nSo did every other man on the ship, including Jenkins.\n\nThe _hlorg_ had stopped eating. Huge and round and wet and ugly, it\nsquatted in the after-hold, quivering gently, without any other sign of\nlife.\n\nSurfeited. Like a fat man after a turkey dinner.\n\nJenkins reviewed progress with the others. No stone had been left\nunturned. They had sliced the _hlorg_, and squeezed it. They had boiled\nit and frozen it. They had dropped chunks of it in acid vats and covered\nother chunks with desiccants and alkalis. Nothing seemed to bother it.\n\nA cold environment slowed down its activity, true, but it also\nstimulated the process of fission. Warmed up again, the portions sucked\nback together again and resumed eating.\n\nHeat was a little more effective, but not much. It stunned the creature\nfor a brief period, but it would not burn. It hissed frightfully and\ngave off an overpowering stench, and curled up at the edges, but as soon\nas the heat was turned off it began to recover.\n\nIn Hrunta's lab chunks of the _hlorg_ sat in a dozen vats on tables and\nin sinks. Some contained antibiotics, some concentrated acids, some\ndesiccants. In each vat a blob of pink protoplasm wiggled happily,\nshowing no sign of discomfiture. On another table were the remains of\nHrunta's (unsuccessful) attempt to prepare an anti-_hlorg_ serum.\n\nBut no Hrunta.\n\n\"He was down there with the thing all day,\" Bowman said sadly. \"He felt\nit was his responsibility, really. Hrunta thought biochemistry was the\nanswer to all things, of course. Very conscientious man.\"\n\n\"But he was in _bed_.\"\n\n\"He claimed he did his best thinking in bed. Maybe he had a brainstorm\nand went down to try it out, and--\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Jenkins nodded sourly. \"And.\" He walked down the row of vats.\n\"You'd think that at least concentrated sulphuric would dessicate it a\nlittle. But it's just formed a crust of coagulated protein around\nitself, and sits there--\"\n\nBowman peered over his shoulder, his mustache twitching. \"But it does\ndessicate.\"\n\n\"If you use enough long enough.\"\n\n\"How about concentrated hydrochloric?\"\n\n\"Same thing. Maybe a little more effective, but not enough to count.\"\n\n\"Okay. Next we try combinations. There's got to be _something_ the\nwretched beast can't tolerate--\"\n\nThere was, of course.\n\n\n\nGreen Doctor Stone brought it to Jenkins as he was getting ready to turn\nin for a sleep period. Jenkins had checked to make sure double guards\nwere posted in the _hlorg's_ vicinity, and jolted them with Sleep-Not to\nkeep them on their toes. All the same, he tied a length of stout cord\naround his ankle just to make sure he didn't do any sleepwalking. He was\ntying it to the bunk when Stone came in with a pan in his hand and a\npeculiar look on his face.\n\n\"Take a look at this,\" he said.\n\nJenkins looked at the sickly brown mass in the tray, and then up at\nStone. \"Where did you find it?\"\n\n\"Down in the hold. Our _hlorg_ has broken precedent. It's _rejected_\nsomething that it ate.\"\n\n\"Yeah. What is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'm taking it to Neelsen for paraffin sections. But I\nknow what it looks like to me.\"\n\n\"Mm. I know.\" Jenkins felt sick. Stone headed up to the path lab,\nleaving the Red Doctor settled in his bunk.\n\nTen minutes later Jenkins sat bolt upright in the darkness. Frantically\nhe untied himself and slid into his clothes. \"Idiot!\" he growled to\nhimself. \"Seventh son of a seventh son--\"\n\nFive minutes later he was staring at the vats in Hrunta's laboratory. He\nfound the one he was looking for. A pink blob of _hlorg_ wiggled slowly\naround the bottom.\n\nJenkins drew a beaker of distilled water and added it to the fluid in\nthe vat. It hissed and sputtered and sent up quantities of acrid steam.\nWhen the steam had cleared away, Jenkins peered in eagerly.\n\nThe pink thing in the bottom was turning a sickly violet. It had quit\nwiggling. As Jenkins watched, the violet color changed to mud grey, then\nto black. He prodded it with a stirring rod. There was no response.\n\nWith a whoop Jenkins buzzed Bowman and Stone. \"We've got it!\" he shouted\nto them when they appeared. \"Look! Look at it!\"\n\nBowman poked and probed and broke into a wide grin. The piece of _hlorg_\nwas truly and sincerely dead. \"It inactivates the enzyme system, and\nrenders the base protoplasm vulnerable to anything that normally attacks\nit. What are we waiting for?\"\n\nThey began tearing the laboratory apart, searching for the right\nbottles. The supply was discouragingly small, but there was some in\nstock. The three of them raced down the corridor for the hold where the\n_hlorg_ was.\n\nIt took them three hours of angry work to exhaust the supply. They\nwhittled chunks off the _hlorg_, tossed them in pans of the deadly\nfluid. With each slice they stopped momentarily to watch it turn violet,\nthen black, as it died. The _hlorg_, dwindling in size, sensed the\nattack and slapped frantically at their ankles, sending out angry plumes\nof wet jelly, but they ducked and dodged and whittled some more. The\n_hlorg_ quivered and gurgled and wept pinkish goo all over the floor,\nbut it grew smaller and weaker with every whack.\n\n\"Hrunta must have spotted it and come down here alone,\" Jenkins panted\nbetween slices. \"Maybe he slipped, lost his footing, I don't know--\"\n\nThey continued to work until the supply was exhausted. They had reduced\nthe _hlorg_ to a quarter its previous size. \"Check the other labs, see\nif they have some more,\" said Stone.\n\n\"I already have,\" Bowman said. \"They don't. This is it.\"\n\n\"But we haven't got it all killed. There's still--\" He pointed to the\nthing quailing in the corner.\n\n\"I know. We're licked, that's all. There isn't any more of the stuff on\nthe ship.\"\n\nThey stopped and looked at each other suddenly. Then Jenkins said: \"Oh,\nyes there is.\"\n\nThere was silence. Bowman looked at Stone, and Stone looked at Bowman.\nThey both looked at Jenkins. \"Oh, no. Sorry. I decline.\" Stone shook his\nhead slowly.\n\n\"But we have to! There's no other way. If the enzyme system is\ninactivated, it's just protoplasm--there's no physiological or\nbiochemical reason--\"\n\n\"You know what you can do with your physiology and biochemistry,\" Bowman\nsaid succinctly. \"You can also count me out.\" He left them and the\nhatchway clanged after him.\n\n\"Wally?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"It'll be months before we get back to Hospital Earth. We know how we\ncan hold it in check until we get there.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nGreen Doctor Wally Stone sighed. \"Greater love hath no man,\" he said\nwearily. \"We'd better go tell Neelsen, I guess.\"\n\n\n\nBlack Doctor Turvold Neelsen's answer was a flat, unequivocal no. \"It's\nmonstrous and preposterous. I won't stand for it. Nobody will stand for\nit.\"\n\n\"But you have the proof in your own hands,\" Jenkins said. \"You saw the\nspecimen that the Green Doctor brought you.\"\n\nNeelsen hunched back angrily. \"I saw it.\"\n\n\"And your impression of it? As a pathologist?\"\n\n\"I fail to see how my impression applies one way or the other--\"\n\n\"Doctor, sometimes we have to face facts. Remember?\"\n\n\"All right.\" Neelsen seemed to curl up into himself still further. \"The\nspecimen was stomach.\"\n\n\"Human stomach?\"\n\n\"Human stomach.\"\n\n\"But the only human on this ship that doesn't have a stomach is Hrunta,\"\nsaid Jenkins.\n\n\"So the _hlorg_ ate him.\"\n\n\"_Most_ of him. Not quite all. It threw out the one part of him it\ncouldn't eat. The part containing a substance that inactivated its\nenzyme system. Dilute hydrochloric acid, to be specific. We used the\nentire ship's supply, and cut the _hlorg_ down to three-quarters size,\nbut we need a continuous supply to keep it whittled down until we get\nhome. And there's only one good, permanent, reliable source of dilute\nhydrochloric acid on board this ship--\"\n\nThe Black Doctor's face was purple. \"I said no,\" he choked. \"My answer\nstands.\"\n\nThe Red Doctor sighed and turned to Green Doctor Stone. \"All right,\nWally,\" he said.\n\n\n\n(_From the files of the Medical Disciplinary Board, Hospital Earth, op.\ncit._)\n\nI am certain that you can see from the foregoing that a reasonable\neffort was made by Green Doctor Stone and myself to put the plan in\neffect peaceably and with full approval of our commander. It was our\nconviction, however, that the emergency nature of the circumstances\nrequired that it be done with or without his approval. Our subsequent\nsuccess in containing the _hlorg_ to at least reasonable and manageable\nproportions should bear out the wisdom of our decision.\n\nActually, it has not been as bad as one might think. It has been\nnecessary to confine the crew to their quarters, and to restrain the\nBlack Doctor forcibly, but with liberal use of Happy-O we can\noccasionally convince ourselves that it is rare beefsteak, and the Green\nDoctor, our pro-tem cook has concocted several very tasty sauces, such\nas mushroom, onion, etc. We reduce the _hlorg_ to half its size each\nday, and if thoroughly heated the chunks lie still on the plate for\nquite some time.\n\nNo physical ill effects have been noted, and the period of quarantine is\nrecommended solely to allow the men an adequate period for psychological\nrecovery.\n\nI have only one further recommendation: that the work team from the Grey\nService be recalled at once from their assignment on Mauki IV. The\nproblem is decidedly not psychiatric, and it would be one of the\ntragedies of the ages if our excellent psychiatric service were to\nsucceed in persuading the Maukivi out of their 'delusion'.\n\nAfter all, Hospital Earth cannot afford to jeopardize a Contract--\n\n                               (Signed) Samuel B.
