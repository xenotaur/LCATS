    "body": "_Paul Asher, 27, men's furnishings buyer, leaned back and let the cloth\nband be fastened across his chest, just under his armpits. He adjusted\nhis heavy spectacles, closed his eyes for a moment, breathed deeply, and\nwas off._\n\nThe semi-darkness was dispelled as he shot out of a tunnel into dazzling\nsunlight. The high-powered vehicle he was driving purred smoothly as it\ntook the long, rising curve. The road climbed steadily toward the\nmountaintop city ahead. He looked around to satisfy himself that he was\nalone in the car.\n\nHe wasn't.\n\nThe girl was a pretty one. He'd seen her somewhere before, he thought.\nShe was looking insolently at him, her wide red mouth in a half smile.\nHer dark hair stirred in the breeze coming through the window, next to\nher, which was open just a slit.\n\nShe said: \"Just keep going, Sweetheart, as fast as you can.\" And she\npatted the oversized pocketbook that lay in her lap.\n\nHe pressed down on the accelerator and the car responded with a flow of\npower. The countryside fell away from the road on either side. Far below\nhe could see a river, winding broadly to the far-off sea. The summer day\nsent its heat-shimmers across the miniature landscape.\n\nThe road curved again. Theirs was the only car he had seen since he'd\ncome out of the tunnel. But now, far ahead, he saw another. It was\nstanding at the side of the road, next to a gate that came down in the\nmanner of one at a railroad crossing. But he knew by its black and white\ndiagonals and by the little sentry hut half hidden behind the other car\nthat it marked the frontier. A man with a rifle on his shoulder stood\nthere. They drew up to it fast, but his foot automatically eased up on\nthe floorboard pedal until the girl spoke sharply.\n\n\"Right through it, Sweetheart.\"\n\nIn the rear-view mirror he saw her leaning forward, her face tense.\n\nIn a moment it would be time to stop, if he were going to.\n\n_Paul Asher hesitated a moment. Then he too leaned forward, the band\npressing into his chest. He was breathing heavily. There was an almost\ninaudible click._\n\nHe trod on the accelerator. He had a glimpse of the guard unslinging his\nrifle from his shoulder and of another man running toward the parked car\nas his vehicle smashed into the flimsy gate and sent it, cracked and\nsplintered, to the side of the road. He fought the slight wrench of the\nwheel and sped on. He thought he heard a shot.\n\n\"Nice work,\" the girl said. She seemed to be appraising him as she\nlooked at him. \"My name, incidentally, is Naomi.\"\n\n\"Hello,\" he heard himself saying as he whipped the car around a curve\nthat hid the frontier behind a hill. \"You seem to know who I am.\"\n\n\"That I do,\" she said.\n\n\"Then why don't you call me by my name, instead of 'Sweetheart'?\"\n\n\"That's because I like you, Sweetheart.\" She was looking out the rear\nwindow. \"Now just step on the gas, because we've got company.\"\n\nThe car that had been parked near the sentry hut was whipping into view\naround the curve. It was lighter than his, but it was fast, too. He\nstepped on it.\n\n\n\nNow the road had become narrow and twisting. The grade was steep but the\nsurface was good. Abruptly, it entered a forest.\n\nThe girl said: \"Two more curves. Then you'll see a field and a barn. Off\nthe road and into the barn, fast.\"\n\nHe took the curves with rubber screaming and almost without braking sent\nthe car bumping across the field and into the barn. It was bigger than\nit had seemed from the outside. As he brought the car to a lurching halt\nthe barn door closed.\n\nWhere he had expected to see stalls and milking machines and hay he saw\nan expanse of metal floor and monstrous machinery. The barn door which\nhad been a rickety wooden slab from the outside was a gleaming sheet of\nmetal from the inside. It glided silently shut and left no joint or seam\nto show where there had been an opening.\n\n\"Out,\" said Naomi.\n\nAs they left the car, a flexible metal arm snaked from one of the smooth\nwalls, attached itself to the front bumper of the vehicle, and whisked\nit into a cubicle which opened to receive it and closed behind it.\n\nA power-driven wheelchair sped up to them. Sitting in it was a fat man\nof middle age, with pendulous jowls and a totally bald head. His\nexpression was a sardonic scowl.\n\n\"You have the plans?\" he asked the girl.\n\n\"Sweetheart here has them.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" the young man said.\n\n\"He knows, all right,\" the girl said. \"He pretends to be innocent, but\nthat is merely his training. He has them under a sticking plaster on\nthe small of his back.\"\n\n\"Remove your coat and shirt,\" commanded the man in the wheelchair.\n\nAt that moment the floor shuddered under their feet, a gong began to\nclang insistently, and the giant machinery, which had been silent,\nthrobbed into life.\n\nThe man in the wheelchair whirled and was off, shouting commands to men\nwho materialized high on the walls in cylindrical turrets which the\nvisitor could only think of as battle stations.\n\n\"What _is_ this place?\" he asked.\n\nHe got no answer. Instead the girl grabbed his arm and pulled him off to\nthe edge of the gigantic metal room. An opening appeared in the wall and\nshe pushed him through it into a room beyond. The entranceway snapped\nshut behind them and when he looked he could see no door. The room also\nwas windowless.\n\nNaomi went to a metal table and as she looked down into its surface it\nbecame a screen. Mirrored in it was the mountainous countryside they had\ndriven through to get to the barn--or what had seemed to be a barn from\nthe outside. He looked over her shoulder.\n\nThey saw as from a height. There was the light car that had chased them\nfrom the frontier. Standing near it was a man in an officer's uniform\nand another in civilian clothes. They were talking and gesturing. Beside\nthe car was a tank. As they watched, its gun fired and the structure\nthey were in shuddered, but they heard no sound.\n\nLumbering up the mountain road were more tanks and a self-propelled gun.\nOne of the tanks became enveloped in smoke and flames as they watched.\nAfter a moment the smoke cleared. The tank was gone; where it had been\nthere was a deep crater.\n\nGradually, the figures in the drama below grew smaller. At the same time\nthe vista widened, so that they saw more and more countryside. It\ntwisted beneath them and the horizon came giddily into view. A few\nmoments later the curvature of the earth could be plainly seen.\n\nEverything fitted together at once. Some of the things, anyway.\n\n\"We're in a ship,\" he said. \"Some kind of rocket-ship.\"\n\n\"It's a planet plane,\" the girl said. \"We're safe now.\"\n\n\"Safe from what?\" he asked. \"What's this all about?\"\n\nShe smiled enigmatically. \"Hafitz could tell you, if he chose. He's the\nboss.\"\n\n\"The man in the wheelchair?\"\n\nShe nodded and took out a compact. As she added lipstick to her mouth,\nshe looked him over, between glances in her mirror.\n\n\"You don't look like the spy type. If there is a type.\"\n\n\"I'm not a spy. I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"The innocent! Go on, take off your coat and shirt. We'll save Hafitz\nsome time.\"\n\n\"I'll be glad to, just to prove this is all ridiculous. A case of\nmistaken identity. You've made a mistake, that's what you've done.\"\n\nHe stood there, hesitating.\n\nThe girl gave a burst of laughter. Then she said: \"All right,\nSweetheart. I'll turn my back.\"\n\nShe did, and he pulled his shirt out of his trousers. Then he froze.\nTaped to the skin of his back was a flat package.\n\n_Paul Asher made the decision. He bent forward, feeling perspiration in\nthe palms of his hands. There was a faint click._\n\n\n\nQuickly he ripped the adhesive from his back. There was an instant of\npain as the plaster came free. He wadded up the sticky package, dropped\nit to the floor and kicked it under the desk.\n\nThen he took off his coat, tie and shirt.\n\n\"You can turn around now,\" he said.\n\n\"A more modest spy I've never seen. Okay,\" she said, \"now _you_ turn\naround.\"\n\n\"As you see,\" he said, \"there are no plans--no papers.\"\n\n\"No--not now. But there is a red mark on your back. What is it?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Oh--that's a birthmark.\"\n\nShe spun him around to face her. Her face was harsh. She slapped his\ncheek. \"Where is the sticking plaster? Don't trifle with me.\"\n\nHer eyes bored into his. He returned the gaze, then shrugged.\n\n\"Under the desk,\" he said. \"I tore it off and kicked it under the desk.\"\n\n\"You are sensible to confess,\" she said.\n\nShe bent down, unwisely.\n\n_Paul Asher felt the familiar tightening in his chest as he leaned\nforward. The click was barely heard._\n\nHe raised his hand and brought the edge of it down hard on the back of\nher neck.\n\nShe crumpled and fell to the metal floor. He noticed that a smear of her\nfreshly-applied lipstick came off on it.\n\nHe pushed the unconscious body aside and fished the packet out from\nunder the desk. He searched the room for another hiding place.\n\nBut it was too late. A section of wall opened and Hafitz, the fat man in\nthe wheelchair, sped in.\n\nHe wheeled past the young man, looked briefly at the unconscious girl,\nthen whisked himself around.\n\n\"You will pay for this, my friend,\" he said. \"But first we will have the\nplans for the way-station. Where are they?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about any plans and I don't know anything about a\nway-station. I tried to tell the girl: it's all a crazy mistake.\"\n\n\"We will see,\" said Hafitz. He pressed a button on the arm of his\nwheelchair and two bruisers appeared through the walls, in the abrupt\nway people had of materializing here. Bruisers was the only way they\ncould be described. They were human brutes, all muscle and malevolence.\n\n\"Take them,\" said Hafitz, indicating the unconscious girl and the young\nman. \"Take them and search them for a small packet. If you do not find\nit, search this room. If you do not find it still, hurt the male animal.\nThey persuade well with pain here, I understand. But do not kill him. I\nwill be in the communications room.\"\n\nHe sped off, through a wall opening.\n\nOne of the bruisers picked up the girl, roughly, and disappeared with\nher. The other grabbed the young man and hauled him off in a third\ndirection. The young man hastily snatched up his coat, shirt and tie en\nroute.\n\nThey ended up in a cell of a room, about seven feet in all directions,\nin which the bruiser stripped him, methodically went through each piece\nof clothing, and then satisfied himself that he didn't have the packet\nanywhere on his body.\n\nThe muscle-man then raised a fist.\n\n\"Wait,\" his prospective victim said. He thought back quickly. \"Hafitz\ndidn't say you could bat me around till you searched the room, too.\"\n\nThe other spoke for the first time. \"You say the truth.\" He put his arm\ndown.\n\nThe young man watched intently as the bruiser went through the wall of\nthe cell-like room.\n\nHe dressed fast. By placing his fingers in exactly the same position as\nthe other had done, was able to make the wall open for him.\n\nThe silver-metal corridor had two directions. He went to the right.\nAfter many turnings, at each of which he reconnoitered carefully, he\ncame to a passageway that was damp. Why it was damp he couldn't tell,\nbut there in the wetness were tracks which could have been made by a\nwheelchair.\n\nHe followed them, feeling the throb of giant engines underfoot.\n\n\n\nThe wheelchair tracks abruptly made a ninety-degree turn and ended at a\nblank wall. Somewhere beyond it must be the communications room.\n\nHe retreated and waited.\n\nIn time the wall snapped open and Hafitz sped out. The young man\nretreated into the maze of corridors and hoped chance would be on his\nside. It was. Hafitz went another way.\n\nThe young man ran back to the wall and used his fingers on it in the\ncombination he had learned. It opened for him.\n\nHe closed it behind him and blinked at the huge instrument panel which\nfilled almost the entire room.\n\nOne of the instruments was a color vision screen, tuned in to a room in\nwhich there was a mahogany desk, at which was seated a man in uniform.\nBehind him was a map of the United States.\n\nThe man in uniform was a major general in the Air Force. An aide, a\nlieutenant colonel, was leaning over the desk. He had a sheaf of papers\nin his hand. The men's conversation was audible.\n\n\"Messages have been coming in from all over Europe,\" the colonel was\nsaying. \"Here's the way it reconstructs:\n\n\"Our agent was en route to the rendezvous when he was intercepted by\nNaomi. That's the only name we have for her. She's a spy. She's worked\nfor half a dozen countries and her present employer could be any one of\nthem. They were spotted as they crossed the frontier between Italy and\nFrance. Their car went into a barn and we thought we had them. But the\nbarn turned out to be a spaceship in disguise. It took off.\"\n\n_So I'm their agent, Paul Asher thought. So that's what it's all about.\nI'm a secret agent for the United States, but they didn't tell me\nanything about it. This is real George, this is ... He expected to hear\na faint click and leaned forward experimentally, but nothing happened.\nHe leaned backward. Still nothing._\n\nThe colonel was answering a question from the general. \"We don't know\nwho they are, Sir. They're not from Earth, obviously. And the best\nscientific minds go still further--they're not even from our solar\nsystem. Whoever they are, it's clear that they don't want us to build a\nway-station in space.\"\n\n\"Those spaceships started buzzing around right after our first Moon\ntrip,\" the general said. \"This is the first time they've become really\ntroublesome--now that we've got the Moon under control and are ready to\nbuild the way-station so we can get to Mars.\"\n\n\"That's right, Sir,\" said the colonel.\n\n\"Progress is a wonderful thing,\" said the general. \"Things certainly\nhave changed since those early days of strategic atomic bombing and\nguided missile experiments.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" said the colonel.\n\nThe young man in the communications room of the spaceship let his\nattention wander away from the scene back on Earth and experimented with\nsome of the switches and controls. Trial and error led him to one which\nlit up a signal on the desk of the general.\n\nThe general flicked it on.\n\n\"Yes?\" he said. He looked puzzled when he got no picture, just a voice\nsaying, \"Hello, hello.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" he said. \"Hello. Speak up, man.\"\n\n\"This is your agent aboard the enemy spaceship,\" said the young man. \"Do\nyou read me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the general. \"We read you. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"I may not have much time. Get a fix on me if you can. And send help.\"\n\n\"What's your position?\" the general was reacting well. He was alert and\nall business.\n\n\"I don't know. I've been taken prisoner, but I'm temporarily free. There\nisn't much time. Hafitz is bound to be back soon. He seems to be the\nbrains of this outfit--this part of the outfit, anyway. Naomi is here,\ntoo, but I don't know whether she's with them or against them.\"\n\n\"Where are the plans, son?\" asked the general.\n\n\"They're safe, for the moment. I can't guarantee for how long.\"\n\n\"I'm getting the fix,\" the colonel said. He was beyond the range of the\nyoung man's vision screen. \"I've got him. He's still within range, but\naccelerating fast. We can intercept if we get up a rocket soon enough.\"\n\n\"Get it up,\" ordered the general. \"Get up a squadron. Scramble the Moon\npatrol and send out reserves from Earth at once.\"\n\n\"Right!\" said the colonel.\n\nThe young man was so engrossed in the makings of his rescue party that\nhe didn't see the wall open up behind him.\n\nThere was a squeak of rubber tires and he whirled to see Hafitz, in his\nwheelchair, slamming toward him. The fat man's hand held a weird-looking\ngun.\n\nThe young man recoiled. His back pushed against a row of control\nbuttons.\n\n_Then everything went white._\n\n\n\nPaul Asher blinked his eyes, like a man awakening from a vivid dream.\n\nThe house lights went on and the manager of the theater came on the\nstage. He stood in front of the blank master screen with its\ncheckerboard pattern of smaller screens, on which the several lines of\naction had taken place simultaneously. Paul took off his selectorscope\nspectacles with the earphone attachments.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" the manager said. \"I regret very much having to\nannounce that this vicarion of the production _Spies from Space_ was\ndefective. The multifilm has broken and, because of the complexity of\nthe vikie process, it will be impossible to splice it without returning\nit to the laboratory.\n\n\"Ushers are at the exits with passes good for any future performance.\nThose of you who prefer can exchange them at the box office for a full\nrefund of your admission price.\"\n\nPaul Asher unstrapped the wired canvas band from across his chest. He\nput the selectorscope spectacles into the pouch on the arm of the seat\nand walked out of the R.K.O. Vicarion into High Street and around the\ncorner to where his car was parked.\n\nHis roommate at the communapt, MacCloy, was still up when he got there,\ngoing over some projectos. Mac snapped off the screen and quickly swept\nthe slides together and into a case.\n\n\"You're back early,\" MacCloy said.\n\n\"The multifilm broke,\" Paul told him.\n\n\"Oh.\" Mac seemed abstracted, as he often did, and again Paul wondered\nabout this man he knew so casually and who had never confided in him\nabout anything--especially about his government job.\n\n\"So I missed the ending,\" Paul said. \"I guess it was near the end,\nanyhow. The space patrol was on the way, but the villain, that Hafitz,\nwas just about to blast me with his gun and I don't know how I would\nhave got out of that.\"\n\n\"I remember that,\" Mac said. He laughed. \"You must have been Positive\nall the way through. Like I was when I saw it. If you'd had any negative\nreactions--if you'd leaned back against the strap instead of\nforward--you'd have been at some other point in the multiplot and I\nwouldn't have recognized that part. Want me to tell you how it ends?\"\n\n\"Go ahead. Then if I do see it again I'll change the ending somewhere\nalong the line with a lean-back.\"\n\n\"Okay. There really wasn't much more. It takes so much film to provide\nall the plot choices that they can't make them very long.\n\n\"Well, Hafitz blasts me and misses,\" Mac went on, \"--or blasts _you_ and\nmisses, to keep it in your viewpoint. When you jump back, you set off a\nbunch of controls. That was the control room, too, not just the\ncommunications room. Well, those controls you lean back against take the\nship out of automatic pilot and send it into some wild acrobatics and\nthat's why Hafitz misses. Also it knocks him out of the wheelchair so\nhe's helpless and you get his gun. Also you see that the plans are still\nthere--right where you put them, stuck to the bottom of his wheelchair.\"\n\n\"So that was it,\" said Paul.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mac. \"And then you cover Hafitz while he straightens out the\nship and you rendezvous with the space control and they take you all\ninto custody. You get a citation from the government. That's about it.\nCorny, huh?\"\n\n\"But what about the girl?\" Paul asked. \"Is she really a spy?\"\n\n\"Girl? What girl?\"\n\n\"Naomi, her name was,\" Paul said. \"You couldn't miss her. She was in the\nvikie right at the beginning--that brunette in the fast car.\"\n\n\"But there wasn't any girl, Paul,\" Mac insisted. \"Not when I saw it.\"\n\n\"Of course there was. There had to be--the vikies all start out the same\nway, no matter who sees them.\"\n\n\"It beats me, pal. I know I didn't see her. Maybe you dreamed up the\ndame.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Paul said. \"But of course it's possible.\" He yawned.\n\"I wouldn't mind dreaming of her tonight, at that. Think I'll turn in\nnow, Mac. I've got that long trip tomorrow, you know. Up to Canada to\nlook over a new line of Marswool sport jackets at the All-Planets\nShowroom.\"\n\n\"Driving or flying?\"\n\n\"The weather prognosis is zero-zero. I'll drive.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Mac.\n\n\n\nPaul Asher woke up late. He had a confused recollection of a dream.\nSomething about a beautiful brunette giving him a backrub.\n\nA look at the chrono sent the dream out of his head and he hurried\nthrough shaving and dressing.\n\nHis car was waiting for him, engine idling, at the curb. He got in,\ntossing his briefcase and topcoat ahead of him to the far side of the\nfront seat. His back began to itch, insistently, and he rubbed it\nagainst the leather upholstery.\n\nPaul adjusted the safety belt around him, and fastened it. Might as well\ndo it now, instead of having to fool around with it later. Damn that\nitch, anyway! It was as if something were stuck to his skin--like a\nsticking plaster....\n\nThe high-powered vehicle purred smoothly as it took a long, rising\ncurve. The road climbed steadily toward the mountaintop city ahead.\n\nThe scene was familiar.\n\nThe itching of his back spread and became a prickly feeling in the small\nhairs at the nape of his neck.\n\nHe knew now that he was not alone in the car. He looked in the rear-view\nmirror.\n\nNaomi.\n\nShe was looking at him insolently, her wide red mouth in a half smile.\n\nShe said: \"Just keep going, Sweetheart, as fast as you can.\"\n\n\n                                                           ... THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
