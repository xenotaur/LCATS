    "body": "\n\n\n\n\nMr. Jonathon Chambers left his house on Maple Street at exactly\nseven o'clock in the evening and set out on the daily walk he had\ntaken, at the same time, come rain or snow, for twenty solid\nyears.\n\nThe walk never varied. He paced two blocks down Maple Street,\nstopped at the Red Star confectionery to buy a Rose Trofero\nperfecto, then walked to the end of the fourth block on Maple.\nThere he turned right on Lexington, followed Lexington to Oak,\ndown Oak and so by way of Lincoln back to Maple again and to his\nhome.\n\nHe didn't walk fast. He took his time. He always returned to his\nfront door at exactly 7:45. No one ever stopped to talk with\nhim. Even the man at the Red Star confectionery, where he bought\nhis cigar, remained silent while the purchase was being made. Mr.\nChambers merely tapped on the glass top of the counter with a\ncoin, the man reached in and brought forth the box, and Mr.\nChambers took his cigar. That was all.\n\nFor people long ago had gathered that Mr. Chambers desired to be\nleft alone. The newer generation of townsfolk called it\neccentricity. Certain uncouth persons had a different word for\nit. The oldsters remembered that this queer looking individual\nwith his black silk muffler, rosewood cane and bowler hat once\nhad been a professor at State University.\n\nA professor of metaphysics, they seemed to recall, or some such\noutlandish subject. At any rate a furore of some sort was\nconnected with his name ... at the time an academic scandal. He\nhad written a book, and he had taught the subject matter of that\nvolume to his classes. What that subject matter was, had long been\nforgotten, but whatever it was had been considered sufficiently\nrevolutionary to cost Mr. Chambers his post at the university.\n\nA silver moon shone over the chimney tops and a chill, impish\nOctober wind was rustling the dead leaves when Mr. Chambers\nstarted out at seven o'clock.\n\nIt was a good night, he told himself, smelling the clean, crisp\nair of autumn and the faint pungence of distant wood smoke.\n\nHe walked unhurriedly, swinging his cane a bit less jauntily than\ntwenty years ago. He tucked the muffler more securely under the\nrusty old topcoat and pulled his bowler hat more firmly on his\nhead.\n\nHe noticed that the street light at the corner of Maple and\nJefferson was out and he grumbled a little to himself when he was\nforced to step off the walk to circle a boarded-off section of\nnewly-laid concrete work before the driveway of 816.\n\nIt seemed that he reached the corner of Lexington and Maple just\na bit too quickly, but he told himself that this couldn't be. For\nhe never did that. For twenty years, since the year following his\nexpulsion from the university, he had lived by the clock.\n\nThe same thing, at the same time, day after day. He had not\ndeliberately set upon such a life of routine. A bachelor, living\nalone with sufficient money to supply his humble needs, the timed\nexistence had grown on him gradually.\n\nSo he turned on Lexington and back on Oak. The dog at the corner\nof Oak and Jefferson was waiting for him once again and came out\nsnarling and growling, snapping at his heels. But Mr. Chambers\npretended not to notice and the beast gave up the chase.\n\nA radio was blaring down the street and faint wisps of what it\nwas blurting floated to Mr. Chambers.\n\n\"... still taking place ... Empire State building disappeared ...\nthin air ... famed scientist, Dr. Edmund Harcourt....\"\n\nThe wind whipped the muted words away and Mr. Chambers grumbled\nto himself. Another one of those fantastic radio dramas,\nprobably. He remembered one from many years before, something\nabout the Martians. And Harcourt! What did Harcourt have to do\nwith it? He was one of the men who had ridiculed the book\nMr. Chambers had written.\n\nBut he pushed speculation away, sniffed the clean, crisp air again,\nlooked at the familiar things that materialized out of the late\nautumn darkness as he walked along. For there was nothing ...\nabsolutely nothing in the world ... that he would let upset him.\nThat was a tenet he had laid down twenty years ago.\n\n\n\nThere was a crowd of men in front of the drugstore at the corner\nof Oak and Lincoln and they were talking excitedly. Mr. Chambers\ncaught some excited words: \"It's happening everywhere.... What\ndo you think it is.... The scientists can't explain....\"\n\nBut as Mr. Chambers neared them they fell into what seemed an\nabashed silence and watched him pass. He, on his part, gave them\nno sign of recognition. That was the way it had been for many\nyears, ever since the people had become convinced that he did not\nwish to talk.\n\nOne of the men half started forward as if to speak to him, but\nthen stepped back and Mr. Chambers continued on his walk.\n\nBack at his own front door he stopped and as he had done a\nthousand times before drew forth the heavy gold watch from his\npocket.\n\nHe started violently. It was only 7:30!\n\nFor long minutes he stood there staring at the watch in\naccusation. The timepiece hadn't stopped, for it still ticked\naudibly.\n\nBut 15 minutes too soon! For twenty years, day in, day out, he\nhad started out at seven and returned at a quarter of eight.\nNow....\n\nIt wasn't until then that he realized something else was wrong.\nHe had no cigar. For the first time he had neglected to purchase\nhis evening smoke.\n\nShaken, muttering to himself, Mr. Chambers let himself in his\nhouse and locked the door behind him.\n\nHe hung his hat and coat on the rack in the hall and walked\nslowly into the living room. Dropping into his favorite chair, he\nshook his head in bewilderment.\n\nSilence filled the room. A silence that was measured by the\nticking of the old fashioned pendulum clock on the mantelpiece.\n\nBut silence was no strange thing to Mr. Chambers. Once he had\nloved music ... the kind of music he could get by tuning in\nsymphonic orchestras on the radio. But the radio stood silent in\nthe corner, the cord out of its socket. Mr. Chambers had pulled\nit out many years before. To be precise, upon the night when the\nsymphonic broadcast had been interrupted to give a news flash.\n\nHe had stopped reading newspapers and magazines too, had exiled\nhimself to a few city blocks. And as the years flowed by, that\nself exile had become a prison, an intangible, impassable wall\nbounded by four city blocks by three. Beyond them lay utter,\nunexplainable terror. Beyond them he never went.\n\nBut recluse though he was, he could not on occasion escape from\nhearing things. Things the newsboy shouted on the streets, things\nthe men talked about on the drugstore corner when they didn't see\nhim coming.\n\nAnd so he knew that this was the year 1960 and that the wars in\nEurope and Asia had flamed to an end to be followed by a terrible\nplague, a plague that even now was sweeping through country after\ncountry like wild fire, decimating populations. A plague\nundoubtedly induced by hunger and privation and the miseries of\nwar.\n\nBut those things he put away as items far removed from his own\nsmall world. He disregarded them. He pretended he had never heard\nof them. Others might discuss and worry over them if they wished.\nTo him they simply did not matter.\n\nBut there were two things tonight that did matter. Two curious,\nincredible events. He had arrived home fifteen minutes early. He\nhad forgotten his cigar.\n\nHuddled in the chair, he frowned slowly. It was disquieting to\nhave something like that happen. There must be something wrong.\nHad his long exile finally turned his mind ... perhaps just a\nvery little ... enough to make him queer? Had he lost his sense\nof proportion, of perspective?\n\nNo, he hadn't. Take this room, for example. After twenty years it\nhad come to be as much a part of him as the clothes he wore.\nEvery detail of the room was engraved in his mind with ...\nclarity; the old center leg table with its green covering and\nstained glass lamp; the mantelpiece with the dusty bric-a-brac;\nthe pendulum clock that told the time of day as well as the day\nof the week and month; the elephant ash tray on the tabaret and,\nmost important of all, the marine print.\n\nMr. Chambers loved that picture. It had depth, he always said. It\nshowed an old sailing ship in the foreground on a placid sea. Far\nin the distance, almost on the horizon line, was the vague\noutline of a larger vessel.\n\nThere were other pictures, too. The forest scene above the\nfireplace, the old English prints in the corner where he sat, the\nCurrier and Ives above the radio. But the ship print was directly\nin his line of vision. He could see it without turning his head.\nHe had put it there because he liked it best.\n\nFurther reverie became an effort as Mr. Chambers felt himself\nsuccumbing to weariness. He undressed and went to bed. For an\nhour he lay awake, assailed by vague fears he could neither\ndefine nor understand.\n\nWhen finally he dozed off it was to lose himself in a series of\nhorrific dreams. He dreamed first that he was a castaway on a\ntiny islet in mid-ocean, that the waters around the island teemed\nwith huge poisonous sea snakes ... hydrophinnae ... and that\nsteadily those serpents were devouring the island.\n\nIn another dream he was pursued by a horror which he could\nneither see nor hear, but only could imagine. And as he sought to\nflee he stayed in the one place. His legs worked frantically,\npumping like pistons, but he could make no progress. It was as if\nhe ran upon a treadway.\n\nThen again the terror descended on him, a black, unimagined thing\nand he tried to scream and couldn't. He opened his mouth and\nstrained his vocal cords and filled his lungs to bursting with\nthe urge to shriek ... but not a sound came from his lips.\n\n\n\nAll next day he was uneasy and as he left the house that evening,\nat precisely seven o'clock, he kept saying to himself: \"You must\nnot forget tonight! You must remember to stop and get your\ncigar!\"\n\nThe street light at the corner of Jefferson was still out and in\nfront of 816 the cemented driveway was still boarded off.\nEverything was the same as the night before.\n\nAnd now, he told himself, the Red Star confectionery is in the\nnext block. I must not forget tonight. To forget twice in a row\nwould be just too much.\n\nHe grasped that thought firmly in his mind, strode just a bit\nmore rapidly down the street.\n\nBut at the corner he stopped in consternation. Bewildered, he\nstared down the next block. There was no neon sign, no splash of\nfriendly light upon the sidewalk to mark the little store tucked\naway in this residential section.\n\nHe stared at the street marker and read the word slowly: GRANT. He\nread it again, unbelieving, for this shouldn't be Grant Street, but\nMarshall. He had walked two blocks and the confectionery was between\nMarshall and Grant. He hadn't come to Marshall yet ... and here was\nGrant.\n\nOr had he, absent-mindedly, come one block farther than he\nthought, passed the store as on the night before?\n\nFor the first time in twenty years, Mr. Chambers retraced his\nsteps. He walked back to Jefferson, then turned around and went\nback to Grant again and on to Lexington. Then back to Grant\nagain, where he stood astounded while a single, incredible fact\ngrew slowly in his brain:\n\n_There wasn't any confectionery! The block from Marshall to Grant\nhad disappeared!_\n\nNow he understood why he had missed the store on the night\nbefore, why he had arrived home fifteen minutes early.\n\nOn legs that were dead things he stumbled back to his home. He\nslammed and locked the door behind him and made his way\nunsteadily to his chair in the corner.\n\nWhat was this? What did it mean? By what inconceivable\nnecromancy could a paved street with houses, trees and buildings\nbe spirited away and the space it had occupied be closed up?\n\nWas something happening in the world which he, in his secluded\nlife, knew nothing about?\n\nMr. Chambers shivered, reached to turn up the collar of his coat,\nthen stopped as he realized the room must be warm. A fire blazed\nmerrily in the grate. The cold he felt came from something ...\nsomewhere else. The cold of fear and horror, the chill of a half\nwhispered thought.\n\nA deathly silence had fallen, a silence still measured by the\npendulum clock. And yet a silence that held a different tenor than\nhe had ever sensed before. Not a homey, comfortable silence ... but\na silence that hinted at emptiness and nothingness.\n\nThere was something back of this, Mr. Chambers told himself.\nSomething that reached far back into one corner of his brain and\ndemanded recognition. Something tied up with the fragments of\ntalk he had heard on the drugstore corner, bits of news\nbroadcasts he had heard as he walked along the street, the\nshrieking of the newsboy calling his papers. Something to do with\nthe happenings in the world from which he had excluded himself.\n\n\n\nHe brought them back to mind now and lingered over the one\ncentral theme of the talk he overheard: the wars and plagues.\nHints of a Europe and Asia swept almost clean of human life, of\nthe plague ravaging Africa, of its appearance in South America,\nof the frantic efforts of the United States to prevent its spread\ninto that nation's boundaries.\n\nMillions of people were dead in Europe and Asia, Africa and South\nAmerica. Billions, perhaps.\n\nAnd somehow those gruesome statistics seemed tied up with his own\nexperience. Something, somewhere, some part of his earlier life,\nseemed to hold an explanation. But try as he would his befuddled\nbrain failed to find the answer.\n\nThe pendulum clock struck slowly, its every other chime as usual\nsetting up a sympathetic vibration in the pewter vase that stood\nupon the mantel.\n\nMr. Chambers got to his feet, strode to the door, opened it and\nlooked out.\n\nMoonlight tesselated the street in black and silver, etching the\nchimneys and trees against a silvered sky.\n\nBut the house directly across the street was not the same. It was\nstrangely lop-sided, its dimensions out of proportion, like a\nhouse that suddenly had gone mad.\n\nHe stared at it in amazement, trying to determine what was wrong\nwith it. He recalled how it had always stood, foursquare, a solid\npiece of mid-Victorian architecture.\n\nThen, before his eyes, the house righted itself again. Slowly it\ndrew together, ironed out its queer angles, readjusted its\ndimensions, became once again the stodgy house he knew it had\nto be.\n\nWith a sigh of relief, Mr. Chambers turned back into the hall.\n\nBut before he closed the door, he looked again. The house was\nlop-sided ... as bad, perhaps worse than before!\n\nGulping in fright, Mr. Chambers slammed the door shut, locked it\nand double bolted it. Then he went to his bedroom and took two\nsleeping powders.\n\nHis dreams that night were the same as on the night before. Again\nthere was the islet in mid-ocean. Again he was alone upon it.\nAgain the squirming hydrophinnae were eating his foothold piece\nby piece.\n\nHe awoke, body drenched with perspiration. Vague light of early\ndawn filtered through the window. The clock on the bedside table\nshowed 7:30. For a long time he lay there motionless.\n\nAgain the fantastic happenings of the night before came back to\nhaunt him and as he lay there, staring at the windows, he\nremembered them, one by one. But his mind, still fogged by sleep\nand astonishment, took the happenings in its stride, mulled over\nthem, lost the keen edge of fantastic terror that lurked around\nthem.\n\nThe light through the windows slowly grew brighter. Mr. Chambers\nslid out of bed, slowly crossed to the window, the cold of the\nfloor biting into his bare feet. He forced himself to look out.\n\nThere was nothing outside the window. No shadows. As if there\nmight be a fog. But no fog, however, thick, could hide the apple\ntree that grew close against the house.\n\nBut the tree was there ... shadowy, indistinct in the gray, with\na few withered apples still clinging to its boughs, a few\nshriveled leaves reluctant to leave the parent branch.\n\nThe tree was there now. But it hadn't been when he first had\nlooked. Mr. Chambers was sure of that.\n\n\n\nAnd now he saw the faint outlines of his neighbor's house ... but\nthose outlines were all wrong. They didn't jibe and fit together ...\nthey were out of plumb. As if some giant hand had grasped the house\nand wrenched it out of true. Like the house he had seen across the\nstreet the night before, the house that had painfully righted itself\nwhen he thought of how it should look.\n\nPerhaps if he thought of how his neighbor's house should look, it\ntoo might right itself. But Mr. Chambers was very weary. Too\nweary to think about the house.\n\nHe turned from the window and dressed slowly. In the living room\nhe slumped into his chair, put his feet on the old cracked\nottoman. For a long time he sat, trying to think.\n\nAnd then, abruptly, something like an electric shock ran through\nhim. Rigid, he sat there, limp inside at the thought. Minutes\nlater he arose and almost ran across the room to the old mahogany\nbookcase that stood against the wall.\n\nThere were many volumes in the case: his beloved classics on the\nfirst shelf, his many scientific works on the lower shelves. The\nsecond shelf contained but one book. And it was around this book\nthat Mr. Chambers' entire life was centered.\n\nTwenty years ago he had written it and foolishly attempted to teach\nits philosophy to a class of undergraduates. The newspapers, he\nremembered, had made a great deal of it at the time. Tongues had\nbeen set to wagging. Narrow-minded townsfolk, failing to understand\neither his philosophy or his aim, but seeing in him another exponent\nof some anti-rational cult, had forced his expulsion from the\nschool.\n\nIt was a simple book, really, dismissed by most authorities as\nmerely the vagaries of an over-zealous mind.\n\nMr. Chambers took it down now, opened its cover and began\nthumbing slowly through the pages. For a moment the memory of\nhappier days swept over him.\n\nThen his eyes focused on the paragraph, a paragraph written so\nlong ago the very words seemed strange and unreal:\n\n_Man himself, by the power of mass suggestion, holds the physical\nfate of this earth ... yes, even the universe. Billions of minds\nseeing trees as trees, houses as houses, streets as streets ...\nand not as something else. Minds that see things as they are and\nhave kept things as they were.... Destroy those minds and the\nentire foundation of matter, robbed of its regenerative power,\nwill crumple and slip away like a column of sand...._\n\nHis eyes followed down the page:\n\n_Yet this would have nothing to do with matter itself ... but\nonly with matter's form. For while the mind of man through long\nages may have moulded an imagery of that space in which he lives,\nmind would have little conceivable influence upon the existence\nof that matter. What exists in our known universe shall exist\nalways and can never be destroyed, only altered or transformed._\n\n_But in modern astrophysics and mathematics we gain an insight\ninto the possibility ... yes probability ... that there are other\ndimensions, other brackets of time and space impinging on the one\nwe occupy._\n\n_If a pin is thrust into a shadow, would that shadow have any\nknowledge of the pin? It would not, for in this case the shadow\nis two dimensional, the pin three dimensional. Yet both occupy\nthe same space._\n\n_Granting then that the power of men's minds alone holds this\nuniverse, or at least this world in its present form, may we not\ngo farther and envision other minds in some other plane watching\nus, waiting, waiting craftily for the time they can take over the\ndomination of matter? Such a concept is not impossible. It is a\nnatural conclusion if we accept the double hypothesis: that mind\ndoes control the formation of all matter; and that other worlds\nlie in juxtaposition with ours._\n\n_Perhaps we shall come upon a day, far distant, when our plane,\nour world will dissolve beneath our feet and before our eyes as\nsome stronger intelligence reaches out from the dimensional\nshadows of the very space we live in and wrests from us the\nmatter which we know to be our own._\n\n\n\nHe stood astounded beside the bookcase, his eyes staring unseeing\ninto the fire upon the hearth.\n\n_He_ had written that. And because of those words he had been\ncalled a heretic, had been compelled to resign his position at\nthe university, had been forced into this hermit life.\n\nA tumultuous idea hammered at him. Men had died by the millions\nall over the world. Where there had been thousands of minds there\nnow were one or two. A feeble force to hold the form of matter\nintact.\n\n\n\nThe plague had swept Europe and Asia almost clean of life, had\nblighted Africa, had reached South America ... might even have\ncome to the United States. He remembered the whispers he had\nheard, the words of the men at the drugstore corner, the\nbuildings disappearing. Something scientists could not explain.\nBut those were merely scraps of information. He did not know the\nwhole story ... he could not know. He never listened to the\nradio, never read a newspaper.\n\nBut abruptly the whole thing fitted together in his brain like\nthe missing piece of a puzzle into its slot. The significance of\nit all gripped him with damning clarity.\n\nThere were not sufficient minds in existence to retain the\nmaterial world in its mundane form. Some other power from another\ndimension was fighting to supersede man's control _and take his\nuniverse into its own plane!_\n\nAbruptly Mr. Chambers closed the book, shoved it back in the case\nand picked up his hat and coat.\n\nHe had to know more. He had to find someone who could tell him.\n\nHe moved through the hall to the door, emerged into the street.\nOn the walk he looked skyward, trying to make out the sun. But\nthere wasn't any sun ... only an all pervading grayness that\nshrouded everything ... not a gray fog, but a gray emptiness that\nseemed devoid of life, of any movement.\n\nThe walk led to his gate and there it ended, but as he moved\nforward the sidewalk came into view and the house ahead loomed\nout of the gray, but a house with differences.\n\nHe moved forward rapidly. Visibility extended only a few feet and as\nhe approached them the houses materialized like two dimensional\npictures without perspective, like twisted cardboard soldiers lining\nup for review on a misty morning.\n\nOnce he stopped and looked back and saw that the grayness had\nclosed in behind him. The houses were wiped out, the sidewalk\nfaded into nothing.\n\nHe shouted, hoping to attract attention. But his voice frightened\nhim. It seemed to ricochet up and into the higher levels of the\nsky, as if a giant door had been opened to a mighty room high\nabove him.\n\nHe went on until he came to the corner of Lexington. There, on\nthe curb, he stopped and stared. The gray wall was thicker there\nbut he did not realize how close it was until he glanced down at\nhis feet and saw there was nothing, nothing at all beyond the\ncurbstone. No dull gleam of wet asphalt, no sign of a street. It\nwas as if all eternity ended here at the corner of Maple and\nLexington.\n\nWith a wild cry, Mr. Chambers turned and ran. Back down the\nstreet he raced, coat streaming after him in the wind, bowler hat\nbouncing on his head.\n\nPanting, he reached the gate and stumbled up the walk, thankful\nthat it still was there.\n\nOn the stoop he stood for a moment, breathing hard. He glanced\nback over his shoulder and a queer feeling of inner numbness\nseemed to well over him. At that moment the gray nothingness\nappeared to thin ... the enveloping curtain fell away, and he\nsaw....\n\nVague and indistinct, yet cast in stereoscopic outline, a\ngigantic city was lined against the darkling sky. It was a city\nfantastic with cubed domes, spires, and aerial bridges and flying\nbuttresses. Tunnel-like streets, flanked on either side by\nshining metallic ramps and runways, stretched endlessly to the\nvanishing point. Great shafts of multicolored light probed huge\nstreamers and ellipses above the higher levels.\n\nAnd beyond, like a final backdrop, rose a titanic wall. It was\nfrom that wall ... from its crenelated parapets and battlements\nthat Mr. Chambers felt the eyes peering at him.\n\nThousands of eyes glaring down with but a single purpose.\n\nAnd as he continued to look, something else seemed to take form\nabove that wall. A design this time, that swirled and writhed in\nthe ribbons of radiance and rapidly coalesced into strange\ngeometric features, without definite line or detail. A colossal\nface, a face of indescribable power and evil, it was, staring\ndown with malevolent composure.\n\n\n\nThen the city and the face slid out of focus; the vision faded\nlike a darkened magic-lantern, and the grayness moved in again.\n\nMr. Chambers pushed open the door of his house. But he did not\nlock it. There was no need of locks ... not any more.\n\nA few coals of fire still smouldered in the grate and going\nthere, he stirred them up, raked away the ash, piled on more\nwood. The flames leaped merrily, dancing in the chimney's throat.\n\nWithout removing his hat and coat, he sank exhausted in his\nfavorite chair, closed his eyes then opened them again.\n\nHe sighed with relief as he saw the room was unchanged.\nEverything in its accustomed place: the clock, the lamp, the\nelephant ash tray, the marine print on the wall.\n\nEverything was as it should be. The clock measured the silence\nwith its measured ticking; it chimed abruptly and the vase sent\nup its usual sympathetic vibration.\n\nThis was his room, he thought. Rooms acquire the personality of\nthe person who lives in them, become a part of him. This was his\nworld, his own private world, and as such it would be the last to\ngo.\n\nBut how long could he ... his brain ... maintain its existence?\n\nMr. Chambers stared at the marine print and for a moment a little\nbreath of reassurance returned to him. _They_ couldn't take this\naway. The rest of the world might dissolve because there was\ninsufficient power of thought to retain its outward form.\n\nBut this room was his. He alone had furnished it. He alone, since\nhe had first planned the house's building, had lived here.\n\nThis room would stay. It must stay on ... it must....\n\nHe rose from his chair and walked across the room to the book\ncase, stood staring at the second shelf with its single volume.\nHis eyes shifted to the top shelf and swift terror gripped him.\n\nFor all the books weren't there. A lot of books weren't there!\nOnly the most beloved, the most familiar ones.\n\nSo the change already had started here! The unfamiliar books were\ngone and that fitted in the pattern ... for it would be the least\nfamiliar things that would go first.\n\nWheeling, he stared across the room. Was it his imagination, or\ndid the lamp on the table blur and begin to fade away?\n\nBut as he stared at it, it became clear again, a solid,\nsubstantial thing.\n\nFor a moment real fear reached out and touched him with chilly\nfingers. For he knew that this room no longer was proof against\nthe thing that had happened out there on the street.\n\nOr had it really happened? Might not all this exist within his\nown mind? Might not the street be as it always was, with laughing\nchildren and barking dogs? Might not the Red Star confectionery\nstill exist, splashing the street with the red of its neon sign?\n\nCould it be that he was going mad? He had heard whispers when he\nhad passed, whispers the gossiping housewives had not intended\nhim to hear. And he had heard the shouting of boys when he walked\nby. They thought him mad. Could he be really mad?\n\nBut he knew he wasn't mad. He knew that he perhaps was the sanest\nof all men who walked the earth. For he, and he alone, had\nforeseen this very thing. And the others had scoffed at him for\nit.\n\nSomewhere else the children might be playing on a street. But it\nwould be a different street. And the children undoubtedly would\nbe different too.\n\nFor the matter of which the street and everything upon it had\nbeen formed would now be cast in a different mold, stolen by\ndifferent minds in a different dimension.\n\n_Perhaps we shall come upon a day, far distant, when our plane,\nour world will dissolve beneath our feet and before our eyes as\nsome stronger intelligence reaches out from the dimensional\nshadows of the very space we live in and wrests from us the\nmatter which we know to be our own._\n\nBut there had been no need to wait for that distant day. Scant\nyears after he had written those prophetic words the thing was\nhappening. Man had played unwittingly into the hands of those\nother minds in the other dimension. Man had waged a war and war\nhad bred a pestilence. And the whole vast cycle of events was but\na detail of a cyclopean plan.\n\nHe could see it all now. By an insidious mass hypnosis minions from\nthat other dimension ... or was it one supreme intelligence ... had\ndeliberately sown the seeds of dissension. The reduction of the\nworld's mental power had been carefully planned with diabolic\npremeditation.\n\nOn impulse he suddenly turned, crossed the room and opened the\nconnecting door to the bedroom. He stopped on the threshold and a\nsob forced its way to his lips.\n\nThere was no bedroom. Where his stolid four poster and dresser\nhad been there was greyish nothingness.\n\nLike an automaton he turned again and paced to the hall door.\nHere, too, he found what he had expected. There was no hall, no\nfamiliar hat rack and umbrella stand.\n\nNothing....\n\nWeakly Mr. Chambers moved back to his chair in the corner.\n\n\"So here I am,\" he said, half aloud.\n\nSo there he was. Embattled in the last corner of the world that\nwas left to him.\n\nPerhaps there were other men like him, he thought. Men who stood\nat bay against the emptiness that marked the transition from one\ndimension to another. Men who had lived close to the things they\nloved, who had endowed those things with such substantial form by\npower of mind alone that they now stood out alone against the\npower of some greater mind.\n\nThe street was gone. The rest of his house was gone. This room\nstill retained its form.\n\nThis room, he knew, would stay the longest. And when the rest of\nthe room was gone, this corner with his favorite chair would\nremain. For this was the spot where he had lived for twenty\nyears. The bedroom was for sleeping, the kitchen for eating. This\nroom was for living. This was his last stand.\n\nThese were the walls and floors and prints and lamps that had\nsoaked up his will to make them walls and prints and lamps.\n\nHe looked out the window into a blank world. His neighbors'\nhouses already were gone. They had not lived with them as he had\nlived with this room. Their interests had been divided, thinly\nspread; their thoughts had not been concentrated as his upon an\narea four blocks by three, or a room fourteen by twelve.\n\n\n\nStaring through the window, he saw it again. The same vision he\nhad looked upon before and yet different in an indescribable way.\nThere was the city illumined in the sky. There were the\nelliptical towers and turrets, the cube-shaped domes and\nbattlements. He could see with stereoscopic clarity the aerial\nbridges, the gleaming avenues sweeping on into infinitude. The\nvision was nearer this time, but the depth and proportion had\nchanged ... as if he were viewing it from two concentric angles\nat the same time.\n\nAnd the face ... the face of magnitude ... of power of cosmic\ncraft and evil....\n\nMr. Chambers turned his eyes back into the room. The clock was\nticking slowly, steadily. The greyness was stealing into the\nroom.\n\nThe table and radio were the first to go. They simply faded away\nand with them went one corner of the room.\n\nAnd then the elephant ash tray.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Mr. Chambers, \"I never did like that very well.\"\n\nNow as he sat there it didn't seem queer to be without the table\nor the radio. It was as if it were something quite normal.\nSomething one could expect to happen.\n\nPerhaps, if he thought hard enough, he could bring them back.\n\nBut, after all, what was the use? One man, alone, could not stand\noff the irresistible march of nothingness. One man, all alone,\nsimply couldn't do it.\n\nHe wondered what the elephant ash tray looked like in that other\ndimension. It certainly wouldn't be an elephant ash tray nor\nwould the radio be a radio, for perhaps they didn't have ash\ntrays or radios or elephants in the invading dimension.\n\nHe wondered, as a matter of fact, what he himself would look like\nwhen he finally slipped into the unknown. For he was matter, too,\njust as the ash tray and radio were matter.\n\nHe wondered if he would retain his individuality ... if he still\nwould be a person. Or would he merely be a thing?\n\nThere was one answer to all of that. He simply didn't know.\n\nNothingness advanced upon him, ate its way across the room,\nstalking him as he sat in the chair underneath the lamp. And he\nwaited for it.\n\nThe room, or what was left of it, plunged into dreadful silence.\n\nMr. Chambers started. The clock had stopped. Funny ... the first\ntime in twenty years.\n\nHe leaped from his chair and then sat down again.\n\nThe clock hadn't stopped.\n\nIt wasn't there.\n\nThere was a tingling sensation in his feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
