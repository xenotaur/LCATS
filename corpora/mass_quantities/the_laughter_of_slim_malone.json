    "body": "Time has little to do with reputation in the far West, and accordingly\nthe name of Slim Malone grew old in the region of Appleton, and yet\nthe owner of the name was still young.\n\nAppleton was somewhat of a misnomer, for the region had never known\nanything save imported apples or any other sort of fruit since the\ntime of its birth into the history of whisky and revolvers. But a\nmisguided pioneer in the old days had raised a few scrubby trees and\nhad named the town forever. The dreams of the early agriculturalists\nhad died long ago, but the name remained to pique the curiosity of\ntravelers and furnish jokes for inhabitants.\n\nThe town lay at the conjunction of three gorges in the heart of the\nRockies, and the little plain where it nestled was crowded with\norchards which bore everything but apples. The six original trees\nwhich had given the town its name now stood in the back yard of Sandy\nOrton\u2019s saloon\u2014old trees with knotted and mossy limbs which suggested\na venerable age due to the hard climate rather than to the passage of\nyears. They were pointed out to casual travelers with great pride, and\nthey were the established toast of Sandy\u2019s place. But Sandy\u2019s was\nfrequented by a loud-voiced and spendthrift crowd not usual to\nagricultural towns.\n\nIn the old days, when Appleton was a name rather than a fact, the\nhilarity had been as absent as the men; but after gold was discovered\nin the three gorges which led from the settlement into the heart of\nthe mountains, the little town became a rendezvous of a thousand\nadventurers. The stages to and from the railroad thirty miles away,\nwere crowded with men eager to face the hardships of the climate and\nthe great adventure of the gold-fields.\n\nIt was then that Slim Malone appeared. It was said that he had first\ncome upon the scene as the owner of the Red River strike, which was\nfinally owned by Sandy Gleason. It was further rumored that Sandy had\nbeaten Slim Malone out of the claim by a very shady deal at cards; but\nSandy refused to discuss the matter, and Slim Malone was rarely within\nvocal range, so the matter had never been sifted. Sandy was rarely\nmore vocal than a grunt, and when Slim Malone appeared, people had\ngenerally other things to think about than questions concerning his\npast.\n\nA certain percentage of lawlessness is taken for granted in a mining\ntown. People are too busy with their own concerns to pay attention to\ntheir neighbors, but when three stages in succession, passing from\nAppleton to Concord, the nearest railroad station, were robbed by a\nrider on a white horse, the community awoke and waxed wrath. The loss\nwas too much in common to be passed over.\n\nThe first effort was an impromptu organization of half a dozen angered\nminers who rode into the Weston Hills. They found fresh hoof-prints\nafter an hour of riding, and went on greatly encouraged, with the\npistols loosened in their holsters. After some hours of hard travel\nthey came upon a white horse in the midst of a hollow, and then spread\ninto a circle and approached cautiously. But not cautiously enough.\nWhile they were still far from the white horse the bandit opened fire\nupon them from the shelter of a circle of rocks. They rode into town\nthe next day with three of their number badly hurt and the other three\nmarked for life. That started the war.\n\nAs the months passed posse after posse left Appleton and started to\nscour the Weston Hills for the marauder. The luckiest of the\nexpeditions came back telling tales of a sudden fusillade from an\nunexpected covert, and then a swift white horse scouring into the\ndistance. The majority came back with no tales at all save of silent\nmountains and the grim cactus of the desert.\n\nIn the mean time the stages from Appleton to Concord were held up with\na monotonous regularity by a rider of a fleet white horse, and the\nmining town grew more and more irate. Men cursed the name of Slim\nMalone. An adventurous singer in one of Appleton\u2019s dance halls\ninvented a song featuring the marauder, and it was taken up by the\nmatrons of the town as a sort of scare-crow ballad to hush their\nchildren.\n\nThen the new mayor came to Appleton. He owned three claims on\nAskwarthy Gulch, and he ran on the double platform of no-license for\nthe Appleton saloons and the end of Slim Malone. The women used their\ninfluence because of the first clause in his platform, and the men\nvoted for him because of the second. His name was Orval Kendricks, but\nthat didn\u2019t count. What mattered was his red hair and the statements\nof his platform. Slim Malone celebrated the new reign of holding up\ntwo stages within the first five days.\n\nBut the new mayor lived up to the color of his hair, and proved worthy\nof his platform. He held a meeting of every able-bodied citizen in\ntown three days after his inauguration, and in his speech the men\nnoted with relief that he forgot to mention the saloons, and that he\nconcentrated his attention on Slim Malone. He stated that the good\nname and the prosperity of Appleton depended upon the capture of this\nmarauder at once. Divorced from the mayor\u2019s rather sounding rhetoric,\nthe populace of Appleton realized the truth of his remarks and\napplauded him to the echo. His silences were as much appreciated as\nhis words.\n\nAfter a carefully prepared peroration he built up to his climax by the\nproposal that the community import \u201cLefty\u201d Cornwall, at a salary of\nfive hundred dollars a month and five thousand bonus, to act as deputy\nsheriff until the apprehension of Slim Malone. Then the crowd\napplauded to the echo. In their midst were men who had lost more than\nfive thousand at a blow owing to the strenuous activity of this Slim\nMalone. They were equal to any measures for his suppression even if it\nmeant the importation of Lefty Cornwall.\n\nThe fame of Lefty had begun in Texas when he mortally wounded one\ngreaser and crippled two others in a saloon fight. Since then it had\nincreased and spread until he was a household word even farther north\nthan Appleton. He came from that sun-burned southland where a man\u2019s\nprowess was gaged by his speed and dexterity with his \u201cirons,\u201d and\neven on that northern plateau of Appleton men knew that to cross Lefty\nCornwall was death or murderous mutilation.\n\nAt first there were some dissenters. Men stated freely that Lefty\nwould never dream of coming as far north as Appleton for a paltry five\nthousand dollars. There were even a few dissenters who claimed that\neven should he come he would never be able to cope with Slim Malone,\nbut these were laughed and hooted down by a radical minority who came\nfrom the southland and knew the fame of Lefty Cornwall in detail. The\nsheriff accounted for the others by stating that he had already\ncommunicated with Lefty, and had received his assent by letter. This\nannouncement dissolved the meeting in cheers.\n\nAppleton decreed the day of the arrival of the new sheriff a festival\noccasion. The farmers from the adjoining table-land drove into town,\nthe miners from the three valleys rode down. And when the stage\narrived from Concord the incipient sheriff dismounted in the midst of\na huge crowd, and cheers which shook the sign-board of Sandy Orton\u2019s\nsaloon.\n\nNow the mayor of Appleton had declared deathless war against the\nsaloons in his platform, but since his election he had been strangely\nsilent upon the liquor question. He was as canny as his red hair\nsuggested, and he had a truly Scotch insight into the crucial moments\nof life. He perceived the arrival of Lefty Cornwall to be such a\nmoment, and he perceived at the same moment the correct way of meeting\nthat crisis.\n\nIt was with surprise no less than pleasure that the throng heard the\nlusty voice of their chief official inviting them to Sandy Orton\u2019s\nsaloon, and where they were in doubt, his beckoning arm put them\nright. They filled the saloon from bar to door, and those who could\nnot enter thronged at the entrances with gaping mouths.\n\nThe sheriff was equal to the occasion. He mounted the bar much as a\nplainsman mounts a horse, and standing in full view of his fellow\ncitizens, he invited Lefty Cornwall to join him in his prominent\nposition. Nowise loath, Lefty swung onto the bar in the most approved\nfashion, and stood, locked arm in arm with the dignified official of\nAppleton. In the mean time the bartenders, thrilled equally with\nsurprise and pleasure, passed out the drinks to the crowded room. It\nwas apparently a moment big in portent to Appleton, and not a heart\nthere but pulsed big with pride in their mayor.\n\n\u201cFellow citizens,\u201d began the mayor, raising a large freckled hand for\nsilence.\n\nA hush fell upon the assemblage.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d continued the mayor, after a proper silence reigned, \u201cI\nhaven\u2019t got much to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s to you!\u201d yelled a voice. \u201cI hate a guy that\u2019s noisy.\u201d\n\nThe mayor frowned and waved a commanding hand for silence.\n\n\u201cI spotted you, Pete Bartlett,\u201d he called. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like silence\nyou must hate yourself.\u201d\n\nThe crowd roared with approving laughter.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d began Orval Kendricks again, when the laughter had subsided,\n\u201cthis here is a solemn occasion. I feel called upon to summon the\nmanhood of this here town to listen to my words, and I reckon that\nmost of the manhood of the town is within hearin\u2019.\u201d\n\nA chorus of assent followed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need any Daniel Webster to tell you men that this here town\nis hard hit,\u201d continued Mayor Kendricks. \u201cIt don\u2019t need no Henry Clay\nto tell you that these diggin\u2019s are about to bust up unless we have\nthe right sort of a strong arm man in town. We\u2019ve been sufferin\u2019\npatiently from the aggressions of a red-handed desperado who I don\u2019t\nneed to mention, because his name just naturally burns my tongue.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlim Malone!\u201d cried a dozen voices. \u201cWe\u2019re followin\u2019 you, chief!\u201d\n\nThe mayor thrust his hand into his breast and extended the other arm\nin imitation of a popular wood-cut of Patrick Henry. The crowd\nacknowledged the eloquence of the attitude with a common gaping.\n\n\u201cThere may be some of you guys,\u201d cried the mayor, rising to the\nemotion of the moment, \u201cthere may be some of you guys who don\u2019t know\nthe man I mean, but I reckon that a tolerable pile of Appleton\u2019s best\ncitizens spend a large part of their time cursing Slim Malone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t through damning him yet,\u201d yelled a voice, and the crowd\nvoiced their assent, half in growls and half in laughter.\n\n\u201cHe has tricked our posse as an honest man would be ashamed to do,\u201d\nwent on the mayor, warming to his oration; \u201che has shot our citizens,\nand he has swiped our gold! I\u2019m askin\u2019 you as man to man, can a\nself-respectin\u2019 community stand for this? It can\u2019t. What\u2019s the answer\nthat Appleton makes to this desperado?\u201d\n\nHe paused and frowned the audience into a state of suspense.\n\n\u201cThere is only one answer to this gun-fighter, and that answer stands\nat my right hand,\u201d bellowed the mayor, when he judged that the silence\nhad sunk into his hearers sufficiently. \u201cThe name of the answer is\nLefty Cornwall!\u201d\n\nThe following burst of applause brought a momentary blush into even\nLefty\u2019s cheek. At the reiterated demands for a speech he hitched at\nhis revolver in its skeleton holster, removed his sombrero, and mopped\nhis forehead with a ponderous hand. When it became evident that the\nhero was about to break into utterance the crowd became silent.\n\n\u201cFellows,\u201d began the gun-fighter, \u201cmakin\u2019 speeches ain\u2019t much in my\nline.\u201d\n\n\u201cMakin\u2019 dead men is more your game,\u201d broke in the wit of the\nassemblage.\n\nA universal hiss attested that the crowd was anxious to hear the Texan\ngun-man out.\n\n\u201cBut if you are goin\u2019 to do me the honor of makin\u2019 me sheriff of this\nhere county and this here city of Appleton,\u201d he continued, letting his\neye rove down Appleton\u2019s one street, \u201cI\u2019m here to state that law and\norder is goin\u2019 to be maintained here at all costs. Right here I got to\nstate that the only costs I\u2019m referrin\u2019 to is the price of the powder\nand lead for this here cannon of mine.\u201d\n\nThe crowd broke in upon the speech with noisy appreciation, and many\ncries of \u201cThat\u2019s the stuff, old boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cI been hearin\u2019 a tolerable pile about one Slim Malone,\u201d went on the\nnew sheriff.\n\n\u201cSo have we,\u201d broke in the irrepressible wit of the assemblage, only\nto be choked into silence by more serious-minded neighbors.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d agreed the sheriff. \u201cI reckon you\u2019ve heard a lot too much\nabout him. But I\u2019m here to state that all this talk about Slim Malone\nhas got to stop, and has got to stop sudden. I\u2019m here to stop it.\u201d\n\nHe hitched his holster a little forward again as he spoke and a deep\nsilence fell upon the crowd.\n\n\u201cFellow citizens,\u201d he continued, spitting liberally over the side of\nthe bar, \u201cwhatever gun-play is carried on around here in the future is\nto be done strictly by me, and all you men can consider yourselves\nunder warning to leave your shootin\u2019-irons at home, unless you want to\nuse them to dig premature graves.\u201d\n\nThis advice was received with an ironical chuckle of appreciation from\nthe crowd.\n\n\u201cAs for Slim Malone,\u201d he went on, \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 out into the Weston Hills\nto get him single handed. I don\u2019t want no posse. I\u2019ll get him single\nhanded or bust, you can lay to that; and if I come back to this town\nwithout Slim Malone, alive or dead, you can say that Malone has the\nIndian sign on me.\u201d\n\nHaving finished all that he had to say, Lefty felt about in his mind\nto find a graceful manner of closing his exordium, when the mayor came\nto his assistance. He recognized that nervous clearing of the throat\nand wandering of the eyes out of his own first political experiences.\nNow he raised his glass of colored alcohol and water, which in\nAppleton rejoiced in the name of Bourbon.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d he shouted, \u201cthere ain\u2019t no better way of showin\u2019 our\nappreciation of our new sheriff than by turnin\u2019 bottoms up. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nEvery hand in the barroom flashed into the air, and after a loud whoop\nthere was a brief gurgling sound which warmed the heart of Sandy\nOrton.\n\nIt should have been the signal for a day\u2019s carousal, and the good\ncitizens of Appleton were no wise averse. They desired to hear the\nvoice of their new sheriff in friendly converse. They desired to see\nhim in that most amiable of all poses, his foot on the rail and his\nhand on the bar. They wanted to look him over and size him up just as\na boy wishes to fondle his first gun. But the sheriff objected. He was\nsorry to spoil the fun. He said that they could go ahead and have\ntheir little time, but that they must leave him out. He had business\nto perform that didn\u2019t admit of drinking.\n\nThere might have been adverse criticism of this Spartan strenuousness,\nbut at this point a diversion occurred in the shape of four wild\nriders who broke into Appleton and brought the word that Slim Malone\nhad been out again. This time he had held up a mule train on its way\nto carry provisions up Bender Ca\u00f1on to Earl Parrish\u2019s claim. With his\nusual fine restraint Slim had taken no lives, but he had winged two of\nthe drivers badly and had helped himself from the provisions without\nunnecessary waste. He had even lingered to give first aid to the two\ndrivers whose courage had overcome their sense of proportion.\n\nIf anything had been needed to spur on the new official of Appleton it\ncame in the form of the message which Slim Malone had left with the\nwounded man before he rode away.\n\n\u201cTell the new sheriff,\u201d he called, as he sat easily in the saddle,\n\u201cthat I\u2019ve heard of him, and that I\u2019ll organize a little party for him\nas soon as possible so that we can get better acquainted. Tell him\nthat the one thing he lacks to make him a good fighting man is a sense\nof humor.\u201d\n\nLefty Cornwall heard this message in silence the while he spat with\nvicious precision into a distant spittoon. Afterward, and still in\nsilence, he retired and worked for an hour cleaning his already\nshining revolver and patting and oiling the holster. He performed\nthese grave functions in the house of the mayor, and that dignitary\nannounced later that he had wound up by practising the draw and point,\nwalking and sitting down, and at every angle. The mayor was impressed\npast speech.\n\nWhen Lefty issued at last he found a score of hard riders standing by\ntheir horses in the street.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 what might all this here gang be for?\u201d inquired Lefty mildly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the posse, waitin\u2019 to be sworn in,\u201d announced one of the men.\n\n\u201cSwearin\u2019 in takes a terrible lot of time,\u201d said Lefty, \u201can\u2019 besides,\nI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s done. I don\u2019t want no posse, as I said before. I\nwouldn\u2019t know how to handle it. Anyway, twenty men on horseback make\nenough noise to scare away a whole gang of bandits. You might as well\nstart lookin\u2019 for trouble with a brass band, because you\u2019d sure find\nthe trouble.\u201d\n\nHe hitched at his belt in his customary manner when at a loss for\nwords, and his right hand dropped gracefully upon the handle of his\ngun and drooped thereon somewhat sinisterly.\n\n\u201cThis here Malone,\u201d went on the sheriff, \u201cmay be a tolerable bad man\nin his way, but I ain\u2019t no shorn lamb myself. I\u2019m goin\u2019 out to get\nhim, an\u2019 I\u2019m goin\u2019 to get him by myself. I reckon that\u2019s final.\u201d\n\nThey accepted his announcement with cheers, and set about offering all\nthe information in their power. It was generally believed that the\nbandit lived somewhere at the far end of Eagle Head Ca\u00f1on, about\nfifteen miles from the town. His dwelling had never been spotted, but\nhe was most frequently seen riding to and from this place. Thrice\nposses had raked the ca\u00f1on as with a fine-toothed comb, but they had\nnever come upon a trace of his habitation; but the ca\u00f1on was thick\nwith caves, and heaped with giant boulders which offered innumerable\nplaces of concealment, and the legend was strong that Slim Malone\nlived in that place.\n\nThe next thing was to find a proper mount. This proved a more\ndifficult task. The sheriff knew horses from nose to hoof, and he was\nhard to please. At last he selected a tall roan with a wicked eye and\nflat shoulders which promised speed. These preparations made, he swung\nto the saddle, waved his hand to the crowd, and galloped out of town.\n\nThere was not much bluff about Lefty Cornwall, as the curious-minded\nhad frequently discovered in the past, but as he swung into the narrow\nthroat of Eagle Head Ca\u00f1on, he began to realize that he might have\ngone too far. While he was in the town it had been easy enough to make\nringing speeches. Now that the evening began to come down by lazy,\ncool degrees a certain diffidence grew in him.\n\nHe had fought many men during his brief life, but he had never come\nacross a reputation as strange or as fascinating as this of Slim\nMalone. If the challenge which the bandit had sent him was irritating,\nit also roused in his mind a certain degree of respect, and as he rode\nup the ca\u00f1on, winding slowly among the boulders, a hundred doubts\ninfested his mind.\n\nIf he had been back upon the level reaches of the Texan desert, which\nhe knew, these uncertainties would probably have never entered his\nhead, but here every half mile of his journey was passed under the eye\nof a thousand coverts from which a man could have picked him off with\nthe safety of a hunter firing from a blind at partridges. Moreover a\ncurious loneliness akin to homesickness came in him, located, as far\nas he could discover, chiefly in the pit of the stomach.\n\nThe mountains were blue now, and purple along their upper reaches, and\nas the sun left off the moon took up her reign over the chill blue\nspaces. It was very solemn, almost funereal to the thought of Lefty\nCornwall. And the silence was punctuated with the melancholy howling\nof a far-off coyote.\n\nIt was complete night before he reached the upper end of Eagle Head\nCa\u00f1on, and he was weary from the stumbling gait of his horse over the\nrocks. Moreover, the mountain night air was cold\u2014very cold to Lefty.\nHe wanted desperately to turn back, but he had not the heart to face\nthe inquiries which would meet him at the town, and the covert smiles\nwhich would welcome the hero returning empty handed, the man who\nneeded no posse.\n\nLefty was a very brave man, but like almost all of the physically\ncourageous, he dreaded derision more than actual pain. Yet, in spite\nof this he finally decided that it was better to go back to the town\nand face the smiles than to remain through the cold night in these\ndread silences. He wished heartily that he had taken one other man\nwith him if it were only for the companionship. As it was he felt that\nit was no use to hunt further, and he started back down the ca\u00f1on. He\nhad not gone far when his horse stumbled and commenced to limp.\n\nLefty got off with a curse and felt of the fore hoofs. The difficulty\nproved to be a sharp, three-cornered rock which had been picked up\nunder the shoe of the left fore foot. He was bending over to pry this\nloose between his fingers when he caught the glint of a light.\n\nIn his excitement he sprang upright and stared. At once the light\ndisappeared. Lefty began to feel ghostly. His senses had never played\nhim such tricks before.\n\nHe leaned over and commenced work on the stone again, but as he did so\nhis eye caught the same glint of light. There was no possible mistake\nabout it this time. He remained bent over and stared at it until he\nwas certain that he saw a yellow spot of light, a long, thin ray which\npointed out to him like a finger through the shadows.\n\nThis time he took the bearings of the light carefully, and when he\nstood up he was able to locate it again. Lefty\u2019s heart beat high.\n\nHe threw the reins over his horse\u2019s head and commenced to stalk the\nlight carefully. Sometimes as he slipped and stumbled over the rocks\nhe lost sight of it altogether, only to have it reappear when he had\nalmost given up hopes of finding it again. And so he came upon the\ncave.\n\nThe light shone through a little chink between two tall boulders, and\nas Lefty pressed his eye to the aperture, holding his breath as he did\nso, he saw a long dugout, perhaps a dozen paces from end to end, and\nsome five paces wide. Behind a partition at one end he heard the\nstamping of a horse, and as Lefty gazed, a magnificent white head rose\nbehind the partition and looked fairly at him. His heart stopped as\nthat great-eyed gaze turned on him, the ears pricking and the wisp of\nhay motionless in the mouth. But after a moment the horse dropped his\nhead again and went on crunching his fodder, stamping now and then and\nsnorting as he ate.\n\nAt first he saw no other occupant of the place, but by moving his eye\nto one side of the aperture he managed to get a glimpse of the bandit\nhimself. There was no question about his identity. From the\ndescriptions which he had heard while in Appleton he knew him at once,\nthe expressionless gray eyes, and the thin, refined face with an\nalmost Greek modeling about its lower part.\n\nHe sat tilted back in a heavy chair smoking a pipe and reading, and\nLefty saw that he sat facing a blanket at the far end of the room.\nEvidently this was the entrance. So far as Lefty could see the bandit\nwas unarmed, his two long guns lying on the table half a dozen paces\naway.\n\nVery softly he crept along the side of the boulder, and finally came\nto an aperture, as he had expected. It was just wide enough for a man\nto press through, and from the chisel marks at his sides it had\nevidently been artificially widened from time to time. At the end of\nthe narrow passage hung the blanket.\n\nIf Lefty had proceeded cautiously up to this point, his caution now\nbecame almost animal-like. Behind that blanket he had no idea what was\nhappening. Perhaps the bandit had heard a noise long before, and was\nnow crouched against the wall in another part of the place, ready to\nopen fire at the first stir of the blanket. Perhaps he had stolen out\nof the cave by another entrance and was now hunting the hunter. The\nthought sent a chill down Lefty\u2019s back and he turned his head quickly.\nThen he resumed his slow progress. At the very edge of the blanket he\npaused for a long and deathly minute, but Lefty was not a woman, to\nfail at the last moment.\n\nHe swung the blanket aside and crouched in the entrance with his gun\nleveled. The little round sight framed the face of Slim Malone, who\nstill sat reading quietly and puffing at a black-bowled pipe.\n\n\u201cHands up!\u201d said Lefty softly.\n\nEven then, with his bead on his man, he did not feel entirely sure of\nhimself. It seemed that this could not be true. Opportunity had\nfavored him too much. There must still be some turn of the game.\n\nThe meaningless gray eyes raised calmly from the book. It seemed to\nLefty that a yellow glint came into them for a moment like the light\nthat comes into an animal\u2019s eyes when it is angered, but the next\nmoment it was gone, and he could not be sure that it had come there at\nall. The rest of the face was perfectly calm. Malone lowered the book\nslowly and then raised his hands above his head.\n\n\u201cAh, sheriff,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI see that you have honored my\ninvitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight-o,\u201d said Lefty, \u201cI\u2019m here all right.\u201d\n\nHe felt strangely relieved after hearing his quarry speak. He stepped\nthrough the entrance and straightened up, still with the revolver\nleveled. It was beyond his fondest hopes that he should be able to\nbring the desperado alive to Appleton, and the thought of his complete\nsuccess warmed his heart. Also the immediate prospect of that\nfive-thousand-dollar bonus.\n\n\u201cIn order to remove any strain you may be under,\u201d went on Slim Malone,\n\u201cI\u2019ll assure you that I am quite unarmed. My guns are both lying on\nthe table there. In order that you may make sure, I shall stand up,\nwith my hands over my head, and turn around slowly. You can examine me\nto your own satisfaction.\u201d\n\nHe did as he had said, and Lefty\u2019s practised eyes saw that there was\nnot the suspicion of a lump under the clothes.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Slim Malone, as he faced his captor again, and his smile\nwas strangely winning, \u201cI hope that I may lower my arms and we can\ncommence our little party.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour end of this here party is all over, my beauty,\u201d said Lefty\ngrimly, \u201cexcept that the boys at Appleton may give you a little\nimpromptu reception when we hit town. They seem to be rather strong on\ncelebrations.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I understand,\u201d smiled Slim Malone. \u201cI have no doubt they will be\nglad to see me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t no doubt in the world,\u201d grinned Lefty, warming to the perfect\ncalm of this man. \u201cBetween you an\u2019 me, pal, I\u2019m sorry to have to turn\nthis little trick; but\u2014\u201d\n\nMalone waved a careless and reassuring hand.\n\n\u201cBusiness is business, my dear fellow,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat bein\u2019 the case,\u201d said Lefty, \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask you to turn\naround and put your hands behind your back while I put these here\nbracelets on. I don\u2019t want to discourage you any, but while I\u2019m doin\u2019\nit this here gun will be in my hand and pointin\u2019 at your back.\u201d\n\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d nodded Malone; \u201cquite right, of course; but before we\nstart on our little jaunt back to the camp won\u2019t you have a drink with\nme? I have some really rare old stuff here; quite different from the\nfirewater they put labels on in Appleton.\u201d\n\nLefty grinned appreciatively.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good move, pal,\u201d he said, shaking his head with admiration,\n\u201can\u2019 I know that you\u2019re hard put to it or you wouldn\u2019t try such an old\ndodge on me. It\u2019s a good move, but down in Texas the booze stunt is so\nold that they\u2019ve almost forgotten it\u2014not quite!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Malone, with a little sigh of regret, \u201cthen I suppose we\nshall have to ride out in the night without a nip. Gets mighty chilly\nhere before morning, you know.\u201d\n\nThis fact had gradually dawned on Lefty during his ride up the valley,\nand as he looked forward to the journey back he shivered with\nunpleasant anticipation. In Texas a summer night was one thing; in\nthese mountains it was quite another.\n\n\u201cI suppose the booze is the real thing,\u201d he inquired casually.\n\n\u201cThere are little bubbles under the glass,\u201d said Slim Malone with\nsubtle emotion.\n\nLefty Cornwall sighed deeply. The taste of the Appleton bar whisky\nstill burned his mouth. After all this fellow was a man. He might be a\ncriminal, but Lefty\u2019s own past was not free from shady episodes.\nFurthermore he was about to make five thousand dollars on presenting\nhim to the good people of Appleton.\n\n\u201cIf you sure want a drink before we start, go ahead,\u201d said Lefty.\n\n\u201cThe bottle and a glass is over there in that little dugout on the\nwall,\u201d pointed Malone.\n\nIn the little open hutch on the wall the sheriff perceived a tall\nbottle which shimmered pleasantly in the torch-light.\n\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d said the sheriff, \u201cI reckon you know I\u2019m watchin\u2019 all the\ntime.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely,\u201d said Malone pleasantly. \u201cI know you\u2019re on your job all the\ntime.\u201d\n\nHe walked over to the hutch and picked up the bottle and the glass. He\npaused with the bottle tucked away under his arm.\n\n\u201cQueer thing,\u201d pondered Malone, \u201cthe same pack that held this bottle\nof whisky held this also.\u201d\n\nLefty tightened his grip on the gun as Malone reached deeper into the\nhutch, but he straightened again, and appeared carrying a large\nconcert banjo.\n\n\u201cThat fellow had taste,\u201d he continued, crossing the room and laying\ndown the banjo carelessly on the chair; \u201cjust run your eyes over that\nbanjo.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome banjo, all right,\u201d said the sheriff, \u201cbut hurry up with your\ndrink, Malone. We\u2019ve got to be on our way.\u201d\n\nMalone uncorked the bottle and held it under his nose while he inhaled\na whiff.\n\n\u201cThe old aroma, all right,\u201d he pronounced with the air of a\nconnoisseur; \u201cmust be a vintage as far back as the eighties. You won\u2019t\njoin me?\u201d\n\nNow the heart of the sheriff was a human heart, but his will was\nadamant.\n\n\u201cNot me, Malone,\u201d he answered, \u201cI\u2019ve been in the game too long. Can\u2019t\ndrink on this sort of a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess you\u2019re right,\u201d murmured Malone, letting the amber stream\ntrickle slowly into the glass; \u201cbut it\u2019s too bad.\u201d\n\nHe raised the glass to his lips and swallowed half of the contents\nslowly.\n\n\u201cThe stuff is so oily,\u201d he mused, \u201cthat you don\u2019t need a chaser. Just\nsort of oils its own way down, you know.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff moistened his lips.\n\n\u201cIt certainly is a shame that you can\u2019t taste it,\u201d continued Malone,\nas he drained the glass.\n\nThe sheriff hitched his belt with his customary gesture.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the real thing,\u201d he said judicially.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d pronounced Malone with decision, \u201cand after the sort of\npoison they serve you around here\u2014\u201d\n\nThe sheriff shuddered with sympathy.\n\n\u201cI reckon,\u201d he said hesitatingly, \u201cthat you might pour me just a\ndrop.\u201d\n\nIt seemed to him that as he spoke the yellow glint came into the eyes\nof Malone again, but a moment later it was gone, and he decided that\nthe change had been merely a shadow from the wavering torch-light. He\ntook the glass which Malone extended to him under the cover of the\npointed gun and raised it slowly to his lips.\n\n\u201cJust stand a bit further back while I drink, pal,\u201d he said.\n\nMalone obeyed, and the sheriff tilted the glass. It was, as Malone had\nsaid, \u201cthe real old aroma,\u201d and the sheriff drew a deep breath.\n\nNow there is a saying about liquor that the drink which does the harm\nis \u201cjust one more,\u201d and certain it is that one whisky calls for\nanother as surely as a question calls for an answer.\n\n\u201cI reckon it ain\u2019t quite as old as you say,\u201d said the sheriff, feeling\nhis way from word to word cautiously. \u201cI reckon it ain\u2019t more than\nfifteen years old at the outside.\u201d\n\nMalone paused, with the bottle suspended over the glass to consider.\n\n\u201cI thought that myself when I first drank,\u201d he nodded; \u201cbut that was\nbefore I got used to it. All Bourbon is a little sharp, you know.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff was inclined to agree. He also felt sure that one more\ndrink would quite banish from his memory the taste of that one drink\nin Appleton. Moreover, the danger, if there was any, was slight, for\nMalone was taking drink for drink with him, and larger drinks at that.\nIt was a sort of subtle challenge to the manhood of the sheriff, and\nhe was as proud of his capacity for whisky as of his speed with a gun.\n\nIt was perhaps half an hour later that the sheriff indicated the banjo\nwith a careless wave of the pistol.\n\n\u201cPlay any?\u201d he inquired, \u201cor do you keep it around as sort of an\nornament?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d smiled Malone. \u201cIt makes the place more homelike, you know,\nand then I sing once in a while, but not often. Folks around here\naren\u2019t particularly partial to my voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pretty good judge,\u201d stated the sheriff; \u201cblaze away, and I\u2019ll\nsee you ain\u2019t interrupted. Been a long time since I had the pleasure\nof hearing any decent singin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe was, as he said, a fairly good judge, and he was delighted with the\nrich barytone which rang through the cave. After a time, as the whisky\nand the music melted into his mood, he began to call for old\nfavorites, darky ballads, and last of all, for the sentimental ditties\nwhich have always charmed the heart of the rough men of the West:\n\u201cAnnie Laurie,\u201d \u201cOld Black Joe,\u201d \u201cBen Bolt,\u201d \u201cSilver Threads Among the\nGold.\u201d\n\nAs he sang the bandit commenced, naturally, to walk back and forth\nthrough the cave, and the sheriff sat back in the chair and with\nhalf-closed eyes waved the revolver back and forth in time. He failed\nto note that as Malone walked up and down each time he made a longer\ntrip, until at last he was pacing and turning close to the table on\nwhich lay the revolvers side by side. He did not note it, or if he did\nhis mind was too thrilled with the tender airs and the tenderer liquor\nto register the fact clearly. It faded into the pleasant blur of his\nsensations.\n\n    Oh, don\u2019t you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt, Sweet Alice\n    with\u2014\n\nThe music stopped. Malone had stooped over the table with the speed of\na bird picking up a grain of wheat, and with the same movement he\nwhirled and fired. The gun spun from the hand of the sheriff and he\nstood staring into eyes which now beyond all doubt flared with a\nyellow animal fire.\n\n\u201cNow put your hands behind your back after you\u2019ve thrown those\nbracelets to me,\u201d said Malone. \u201cI naturally hate to break up this\nparty, but I think you\u2019ve had about enough whisky to keep you warm on\nthe ride back, Lefty, my boy.\u201d\n\nThere was an insane desire on the sheriff\u2019s part to leap upon Malone\nbare-handed, but he had seen too many fighting men in action before.\nHe knew the meaning of those eyes and the steadiness of the revolver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your game, Slim,\u201d he said, with as little bitterness as\npossible; \u201cbut will you tell me why in the name of God you aren\u2019t on\nthe stage? It isn\u2019t what you do, pal, it\u2019s the way you do it!\u201d\n\nAppleton woke early the next morning. Some one shouted and then fired\na pistol. The populace gathered at windows and doors rubbing sleepy\neyes which a moment later shone wide awake, and yawns turned into\nyells of laughter, for down the middle of Appleton\u2019s one street came\nthe sheriff. He was sitting the roan horse, with his feet tied below\nthe girth, and his hands tied behind his back. And even the weary roan\nseemed to feel in his drooping head the defeat of his rider.\n\nUpon the back of the sheriff was a large piece of cardboard, upon\nwhich was printed in large letters the following:\n\n    I\u2019m sending this back with my signature in token of a\n    pleasant evening in my home in Eagle Head Ca\u00f1on. I\u2019m sorry\n    to announce that I\u2019m moved. Slim Malone.",
