But its outward perils could not compare\nwith the Ryzgas themselves, who slept within, ready to wake and\nconquer...._]\n\n\nAt sunset they were in sight of the Ryzga mountain. Strangely it towered\namong the cliffs and snow-slopes of the surrounding ranges: an immense\nand repellently geometric cone, black, its sides blood-tinted by the\ndying sun.\n\nNeena shivered, even though the surrounding cold could not reach her.\nThe ice-wind blew from the glacier, but Var's love was round her as a\nwarming cloak, a cloak that glowed softly golden in the deepening\ntwilight, even as her love was about him.\n\nVar said, \"The Watcher's cave should be three miles beyond this pass.\"\nHe stood rigid, trying to catch an echo of the Watcher's thoughts, but\nthere was nothing. Perhaps the old man was resting. From the other\ndirection, the long way that they two had come, it was not difficult to\nsense the thought of Groz. That thought was powerful, and heavy with\nvengeance.\n\n\"Hurry,\" said Neena. \"They're closer than they were an hour ago.\"\n\nShe was beautiful and defiant, facing the red sunset and the black\nmountain. Var sensed her fear, and the love that had conquered it. He\nfelt a wave of tenderness and bitterness. For him she had come to this.\nFor the flame that had sprung between them at the Truce of New Grass,\nshe had challenged the feud of their peoples and had left her home, to\nfollow him. Now, if her father and his kinsmen overtook them, it would\nbe death for Var, and for Neena living shame. Which of the two was worse\nwas no longer a simple problem to Var, who had grown much older in the\nlast days.\n\n\"Wait,\" he commanded. While she waited he spun a dream, attaching it to\nthe crags that loomed over the pass, and to the frozen ground underfoot.\nIt was black night, as it would really be when Groz and his henchmen\nreached this place; lurid fire spewed from the Ryzga mountain, and\nstrange lights dipped above it; and for good measure there was an\navalanche in the dream, and hideous beasts rushed snapping and ravening\nfrom the crevices of the rock.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Neena in involuntary alarm.\n\nVar sighed, shaking his head. \"It won't hold them for long, but it's the\nbest I can do now. Come on.\"\n\nThere was no path. Now they were descending the steeper face of the\nsierra, and the way led over bottomless crevasses, sheer drops and sheer\nascents, sheets of traitorous glare ice. Place after place had to be\ncrossed on the air, and both grew weary with the effort such crossings\ncost. They hoarded their strength, helping one another; one alone might\nnever have won through.\n\nIt was starry night already when they saw the light from the Watcher's\ncave. The light shone watery and dim from beneath the hoary back of the\nglacier, and as they came nearer they saw why: the cave entrance was\nsealed by a sheet of ice, a frozen waterfall that fell motionless from\nthe rocks above. They heard no sound.\n\nThe two young people stared for a long minute, intrigued and fearful.\nBoth had heard of this place, and the ancient who lived there to keep\nwatch on the Ryzga mountain, as a part of the oldest legends of their\nchildhood; but neither had been here before.\n\nBut this was no time for shyness. Var eyed the ice-curtain closely to\nmake sure that it was real, not dream-stuff; then he struck it boldly\nwith his fist. It shattered and fell in a rain of splinters, sparkling\nin the light that poured from within.\n\n\n\nThey felt the Watcher rouse, heard his footsteps, and finally saw him--a\nshrunken old man, white-haired, with a lined beardless face. The sight\nof him, more marred by age than anyone they had ever seen before, was\ndisappointing. They had expected something more--an ancient giant, a\ntower of wisdom and strength. The Watcher was four hundred years old;\nbeside him even Groz, who had always seemed so ancient, was like a boy.\n\nThe Watcher peered at them in turn. \"Welcome,\" he said in a cracked\nvoice. He did not speak again; the rest of his conversation was in\nthought only. \"Welcome indeed. I am too much alone here.\"\n\n\"You were asleep!\" said Var. Shock made his thought accusing, though he\nhad not meant to be.\n\nThe old man grinned toothlessly. \"Never fear. Asleep or awake, I watch.\nCome in! You're letting in the wind.\"\n\nInside the cave it was warm as summer. Var saw with some surprise that\nall the walls were sheathed in ice--warm to the touch, bound fast\nagainst melting by the Watcher's will. Light blazed in reflections from\nthe ice walls, till there was no shadow in the place. Behind them began\na tinkling of falling water, thawed from the glacial ridges above to\ndescend sheet-wise over the cave mouth, freezing as it fell into\nlengthening icicles. The old man gazed at his work for a moment, then\nturned questioningly to the young pair.\n\n\"We need a little rest out of the cold,\" said Var. \"And food, if you can\nspare it. We're pursued.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. You shall have what I can give you. Make yourselves\ncomfortable, and in one minute.... Pursued, eh? A pity. I see the world\nis as bad as it was when I was last in it.\"\n\nHot food and drink were before them almost at once. The Watcher regarded\nthem with compassion as their eyes brightened and some of the shadow of\nweariness lifted from them. \"You have stolen your enemy's daughter, no\ndoubt, young man? Such things happened when I was young.\"\n\nWarming to the old man now, Var sketched his and Neena's history\nbriefly. \"We should have been safe among my people by now. And before\nvery long, I'm sure, I would have performed some deed which Groz would\nrecognize as a worthy exploit, and would thus have healed the feud\nbetween our families. But our flight was found out too soon. They cut us\noff and forced us into the mountains, and now they are only a few hours\nbehind us.\"\n\n\"A pity, indeed. I would like to help you--but, you understand, I am the\nMountain Watcher. I must be above feuds and families.\"\n\nVar nodded somberly, thinking that an old recluse would in any case be\nable to do little for them against Groz and his violent kinsfolk.\n\n\"And what will you do now?\"\n\nVar grinned mirthlessly. \"We haven't much choice, since they're\novertaking us. I have only one idea left: we can go where Groz may fear\nto follow us.\"\n\n\"To the mountain, you mean.\"\n\n\"And into it, if need be.\"\n\nThe Watcher was broodingly silent; his eyes shifted to Neena, where she\nnestled by Var's side. He asked, \"And you--are you willing to follow\nyour lover in this?\"\n\nNeena returned his gaze without flinching; then she looked sidelong at\nVar, and her lips curled with a proud and tender mockery. \"Follow? Why,\nI will lead, if his courage should fail him.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man said, \"It is no part of my duty to dissuade you from this\nthing. You are free persons. But I must be sure that you know what you\nare doing. That is the second part of the law the First Watcher made: to\nguard lest the unwary and the ignorant should bring harm on themselves\nand on all men.\"\n\n\"We know the stories,\" Var said brusquely. \"In the hollow heart of their\nmountain the Ryzgas sleep, as they chose to do when their world\ncrumbled. But if they are wakened, the mountain will tremble, and the\nRyzgas will come forth.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that?\"\n\n\"As one believes stories.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said the Watcher heavily. \"In my youth I penetrated\nfarther into the mountain than anyone before, farther even than did the\nFirst Watcher. I did not see the sleepers, nor will any man until they\ncome again, but I met their sentries, the sentinel machines that guard\nthem now as they have for two thousand years. When I had gone that far,\nthe mountain began to shake, the force that is in the Earth rumbled\nbelow, and I returned in time.\" Now for the first time Var sensed the\npower in the old man's look, the power of four hundred years' wisdom.\nVar stared down at his hands.\n\n\"The Ryzgas also were men,\" said the Watcher. \"But they were such a race\nas the world has not seen before or since. There were tyrannies before\nthe Ryzgas, there was lust for power, and atrocious cruelty; but such\ntyranny, power, and cruelty as theirs, had never been known. They ruled\nthe Earth for four generations, and the Earth was too little for them.\nThey laid the world waste, stripped it of metals and fuels and bored to\nits heart for energy, poisoned its seas and its air with the fume of\ntheir works, wrung its peoples dry for their labor ... and in each of\nthose four generations they launched a ship of space. They were great\nand evil as no other people has been, because they wanted the stars.\n\n\"Because of them we must build with dreams instead of iron, and our only\nfire is that of the Sun, and even now, two thousand years later, the\nEarth is still slowly recovering from the pangs and poison of that age.\nIf you turn up the sod in the plain where the wild herds graze, you will\nfind numberless fragments of rusted or corroded metal, bits of glass and\nstrange plastic substances, debris of artifacts still showing the marks\nof their shaping--the scattered wreckage of the things they made. And\nwe--we too are a remnant, the descendants of the few out of all humanity\nthat survived when the Ryzgas' world went down in flame and thunder.\n\n\"In the last generation of their power the Ryzgas knew by their science\nthat the race of man would endure them no longer. They made ready their\nweapons, they mined the cities and the factories for destruction, making\nsure that their works and their knowledge would perish with them.\nMeanwhile they redoubled the yoke and the punishments, hastening the\ncompletion of the last of the starships.\n\n\"From the memories that the old Watchers have left here, and from the\nmemories of dead men that still echo in the air, I have gathered a\npicture of that world's end. I will show it to you....\"\n\n\n\nVar and Neena stared, unstirring, with wide vacant eyes, while the old\nman wove a dream around them, and the bright ice-cave faded from their\nvision, and they saw--\n\nBlack starless night, a sky of rolling smoke above the greatest city\nthat was ever built. Only the angry light of fires relieved the city's\ndarkness--that, and the blue-white lightning flashes that silhouetted\nthe naked skeletons of buildings and were followed by thunder and a\nshaking of the earth.\n\nAlong lightless streets, half choked with rubble and with the dead,\npoured a mad, hating horde. The recurrent flashes lit scarred faces,\nnaked bodies blackened and maimed from the hell of the workshops where\nthe Ryzgas' might had been forged, eyes that stared white and half\nsightless from the glare of the furnaces, gnarled hands that now at long\nlast clutched the weapons of the last rebellion--a rebellion without\nhope of new life on a world gutted and smoldering from the fulfilment of\nthe Ryzgas' dream, without slogans other than a cry for blood.\n\nBefore them death waited around the citadel where the masters still\nfought. All round, from the lowest and most poisonous levels of the\nshattered city, the slaves swarmed up in their millions. And the\nlightning blazed, and the city howled and screamed and burned.\n\nThen, unbelievably, the thunder fell silent, and the silence swept\noutward like a wave, from ruined street to street. The mouths that had\nshouted their wrath were speechless, and the rage-blinded eyes were\nlifted in sudden awe. From the center, over the citadel, an immense\nwhite globe soared upward, rising swiftly without sound.\n\nThey had never seen its like, but they knew. It was the last starship,\nand it was leaving.\n\nIt poised motionless. For an instant the burning city lay mute; then the\nmillions found voice. Some roared ferocious threats and curses; others\ncried desolately--_wait!_\n\nThen the whole city, the dark tumuli of its buildings and its leaping\nfires and tormented faces, and the black sky over it, seemed to twist\nand swim, like a scene under water when a great fish sweeps past, and\nthe ship was gone.\n\nThe stunned paralysis fell apart in fury. Flame towered over the\ncitadel. The hordes ran and shrieked again toward the central inferno,\nand the city burned and burned....\n\n\n\nVar blinked dazedly in the shadowless glow of the ice-cave. His arm\ntightened about Neena till she gasped. He was momentarily uncertain that\nhe and she were real and here, such had been the force of the dream, a\nvision of such scope and reality as Var had never seen--no, lived\nthrough--before. With deep respect now he gazed upon the bent old man\nwho was the Mountain Watcher.\n\n\"Some of the Ryzgas took flight to the stars, and some perished on\nEarth. But there was a group of them who believed that their time to\nrule would come again. These raised a black mountain from the Earth's\nheart, and in hollows within it cast themselves into deathless sleep,\ntheir deathless and lifeless sentinels round them, to wait till someone\ndare arouse them, or until their chosen time--no one knows surely.\n\n\"I have told you the story you know, and have shown you a glimpse of the\nold time, because I must make sure that you do not approach the mountain\nin ignorance. Our world is unwise and sometimes evil, full of arrogance,\nfolly, and passion that are in the nature of man. Yet it is a happy\nworld, compared to that the Ryzgas made and will make again.\"\n\nThe Watcher eyed them speculatively. \"Before all,\" he said finally,\n\"this is a world where you are free to risk wakening the old tyrants, if\nin your own judgment your great need renders the chance worth taking.\"\n\nNeena pressed her face against Var's shoulder, hiding her eyes. In her\nmind as it groped for his there was a confusion of horror and pity. Var\nlooked grimly at the Watcher, and would have spoken; but the Watcher\nseemed suddenly a very long way off, and Var could no longer feel his\nown limbs, his face was a numb mask. Dully he heard the old man say,\n\"You are tired. Best sleep until morning.\"\n\nVar strove to cry out that there was no time, that Groz was near and\nthat sleep was for infants and the aged, but his intention sank and\ndrowned under wave upon wave of unconquerable languor. The bright cave\nswam and dissolved; his eyelids closed.\n\n\n\nVar woke. Daylight glimmered through the ice of the cave mouth. He had\nbeen unconscious, helpless, for hours! At the thought of that, panic\ngripped him. He had not slept since childhood, and he had forgotten how\nit was.\n\nHe came to his feet in one quick movement, realizing in that action that\nsleep had refreshed his mind and body--realizing also that a footstep\nhad wakened him. Across the cave he faced a young man who watched him\ncoolly with dark piercing eyes that were familiar though he did not know\nthe face.\n\nNeena sat up and stifled a cry of fright. Var growled, \"Who are you?\nWhere's the Watcher?\"\n\nThe other flashed white teeth in a smile. \"I'm the Watcher,\" he\nanswered. \"Often I become a youth at morning, and relax into age as the\nday passes. A foolish amusement, no doubt, but amusements are few here.\"\n\n\"You made us fall asleep. Groz will be on us--\"\n\n\"Groz and his people could not detect your thoughts as you slept. They\nwere all night chasing elusive dreams on the high ridges, miles away.\"\n\nVar passed a hand across bewildered eyes. Neena said softly, \"Thank you,\nWatcher.\"\n\n\"Don't thank me. I take no sides in your valley feuds. But now you are\nrested, your minds are clear. Do you still mean to go on to the Ryzga\nmountain?\"\n\nNot looking at the Watcher, Var muttered unsteadily, \"We have no\nalternative.\"\n\nThere was a liquid tinkling as the ice-curtain collapsed; the fresh\nbreeze of morning swept into the cave. The youth beckoned to them, and\nthey followed him outside.\n\nThe glacial slope on which the cavern opened faced toward the mountain.\nIt rose black and forbidding in the dawn as it had by sunset. To right\nand left of it, the grand cliffs, ocher and red, were lit splendidly by\nthe morning sun, but the mountain of the Ryzgas drank in the light and\ngave nothing back.\n\nBelow their feet the slope fell away into an opaque sea of fog, filling\na mile-wide gorge. There was a sound of turbulent water, of a river\ndashed from rock to rock in its struggle toward the plain, but the\ncurling fog hid everything.\n\n\"You have an alternative,\" said the Watcher crisply. The two took their\neyes from the black mountain and gazed at him in sudden hope, but his\nface was unsmiling. \"It is this. You, Var, can flee up the canyon to the\nnorth, by a way I will show you, disguising your thoughts and masking\nyour presence as well as you are able, while the girl goes in the other\ndirection, southward, without seeking to conceal herself. Your pursuers\nwill be deceived and follow her, and by the time they catch her it will\nbe too late for them to overtake Var.\"\n\nThat possibility had not occurred to them at all. Var and Neena looked\nat one another. Then by common consent they blended their minds into\none.\n\nThey thought, in the warm intimacy of unreserved understanding: \"_It\nwould work: I-you would make the sacrifice of shame and mockery--yet\nthese can be borne--that I-you might be saved from death--which is alone\nirreparable.... But to become_ I _and_ you _again--that cannot be\nborne._\"\n\nThey said in unison, \"No. Not that.\"\n\nThe Watcher's face did not change. He said gravely, \"Very well. I will\ngive you what knowledge I have that may help you when you enter the\nRyzga mountain.\"\n\nQuickly, he impressed on them what he had learned of the structure of\nthe mountain and of its guardian machines. Var closed his eyes, a little\ndizzied by the rapid flood of detail.\n\n\"You are ready to go,\" said the Watcher. He spoke aloud, and his voice\nwas cracked and harsh. Var opened his eyes in surprise, and saw that the\nWatcher had become again the hoary ancient of last night.\n\nVar felt a twinge of unfamiliar emotion; only by its echo in Neena's\nmind did he recognize it as a sense of guilt. He said stiffly, \"You\ndon't blame us?\"\n\n\"You have taken life in your own hands,\" rasped the Watcher. \"Who does\nthat needs no blessing and feels no curse. Go!\"\n\n\n\nThey groped through the fog above blank abysses that hid the snarling\nriver, crept hand in hand, sharing their strength, across unstable dream\nbridges from crag to crag. Groz and his pack, in their numbers, would\ncross the gorge more surely and swiftly. When Var and Neena set foot at\nlast on the cindery slope of the great volcanic cone, they sensed that\nthe pursuit already halved their lead.\n\nThey stood high on the side of the Ryzga mountain, and gazed at the\ndoorway. It was an opaque yet penetrable well of darkness, opening into\nthe face of a lava cliff, closed only by an intangible curtain--so\nlittle had the Ryzgas feared those who might assail them in their sleep.\n\nVar sent his thoughts probing beyond the curtain, listened intently,\nhead thrown back, to their echoes that returned. The tunnel beyond\nslanted steeply downward. Var's hands moved, molding a radiant globe\nfrom the feeble sunshine that straggled through the fog-bank. With an\nabrupt motion he hurled it. The sun-globe vanished, as if the darkness\nhad drunk it up, but though sight did not serve they both sensed that it\nhad passed through to light up the depths beyond. For within the\nmountain something snapped suddenly alert--something alive yet not\nliving, seeing yet blind. They felt light-sensitive cells tingle in\nresponse, felt electric currents sting along buried, long-idle\ncircuits....\n\nThe two stood shivering together.\n\nThe morning wind stirred, freshening, the fog lifted a little, and they\nheard a great voice crying, \"There they are!\"\n\nVar and Neena turned. Far out in the sea of fog, on a dream bridge that\nthey could not see, stood Groz. He shook the staff he carried. It was\ntoo far to discern the rage that must contort his features, but the\nthought he hurled at them was a soundless bellow: \"Young fools! I've\ncaught you now!\"\n\nBehind Groz the figures of his followers loomed up as striding shadows.\nNeena's hand tightened on Var's. Var sent a thought of defiance: \"Go\nback! Or you'll drive us to enter the mountain!\"\n\nGroz seemed to hesitate. Then he swung his staff up like a weapon, and\nfor the two on the mountainside the world turned upside down, the\nmountain's black shoulder hung inverted above them and the dizzy gulf of\nsky was beneath. Var fought for footing with his balance gone, feeling\nNeena reel against him until, summoning all his strength, he broke the\ngrip of the illusion and the world seemed to right itself. The mist\nbillowed again and Groz was out of sight, but they could hear him\nexhorting his men to haste.\n\nNeena's face was deadly pale and her lips trembled, but her urgent\nwhisper said, \"Come on!\"\n\nTogether they plunged into the curtain of darkness.\n\n\n\nAt Var's thought command Neena froze instantly. \"Feel that!\" he\nmuttered, and she, listening, sensed it too: the infinitesimal trickle\nof currents behind what appeared to be a blank tunnel wall, a rising\npotential that seemed to whisper _Ready ... ready.... _\n\nThe sun-globe floated behind them, casting light before them down the\nfeatureless tunnel that sloped always toward the mountain's heart. Var\nsummoned it, and it drifted ahead, a dozen feet, a little more--\n\nBetween wall and wall a blinding spindle of flame sprang into being,\npulsed briefly with radiant energy that pained the eyes, and went out.\nThe immaterial globe of light danced on before them.\n\n\"Forward, before the charge builds up again!\" said Var. A few feet\nfurther on, they stumbled over a pile of charred bones. Someone else had\nmade it only this far. It was farther than the Watcher had gone into\nthese uncharted regions, and only the utmost alertness of mind and sense\nhad saved them from death in traps like this. But as yet the way was not\nblocked....\n\nThen they felt the mountain begin to tremble. A very faint and remote\nvibration at first, then an increasingly potent shuddering of the floor\nunder their feet and the walls around them. Somewhere far below immense\nenergies were stirring for the first time in centuries. The power that\nwas in the Earth was rising; great wheels commenced to turn, the\nmechanical servitors of the Ryzgas woke one by one and began to make\nready, while their masters yet slept, for the moment of rebirth that\nmight be near at hand.\n\nFrom behind, up the tunnel, came a clear involuntary thought of dismay,\nthen a directed thought, echoing and ghostly in the confinement of the\ndark burrow:\n\n\"_Stop!_--before you go too far!\"\n\nVar faced that way and thought coldly: \"Only if you return and let us go\nfree.\"\n\nIn the black reaches of the shaft his will groped for and locked with\nthat of Groz, like the grip of two strong wrestlers. In that grip each\nknew with finality that the other's stubbornness matched his own--that\nneither would yield, though the mountain above them and the world\noutside should crumble to ruin around them.\n\n\"Follow us, then!\"\n\nThey plunged deeper into the mountain. And the shaking of the mountain\nincreased with every step, its vibrations became sound, and its sound\nwas like that of the terrible city which they had seen in the dream.\nThrough the slow-rolling thunder of the hidden machines seemed to echo\nthe death-cries of a billion slaves, the despair of all flesh and blood\nbefore their monstrous and inhuman power.\n\nWithout warning, lights went on. Blinking in their glare, Var and Neena\nsaw that fifty paces before them the way opened out into a great rounded\nroom that was likewise ablaze with light. Cautiously they crept forward\nto the threshold of that chamber at the mountain's heart.\n\nIts roof was vaulted; its circular walls were lined with panels studded\nwith gleaming control buttons, levers, colored lights. As they watched\nlight flicked on and off in changing patterns, registering the\nprogressive changes in the vast complex of mechanisms for which this\nmust be the central control station. Behind those boards circuits opened\nand closed in bewildering confusion; the two invaders felt the rapid\nshifting of magnetic fields, the fury of electrons boiling in vacuum....\n\nFor long moments they forgot the pursuit, forgot everything in wonder at\nthis place whose remotest like they had never seen in the simplicity of\ntheir machineless culture. In all the brilliant space there was no life.\nThey looked at one another, the same thought coming to both at once:\nperhaps, after two thousand years, the masters were dead after all, and\nonly the machines remained? As if irresistibly drawn, they stepped over\nthe threshold.\n\nThere was a clang of metal like a signal. Halfway up the wall opposite,\nabove a narrow ramp that descended between the instrument panels, a\nmassive doorway swung wide, and in its opening a figure stood.\n\nVar and Neena huddled frozenly, half expecting each instant to be their\nlast. And the Ryzga too stood motionless, looking down at them.\n\n\n\nHe was a man of middle height and stocky build, clad in a garment of\nchanging colors, of fabric delicate as dream-stuff. In his right hand,\nwith the care one uses with a weapon, he grasped a gleaming metal tube;\nhis other hand rested as for support against the frame of the doorway.\nThat, and his movements when he came slowly down the ramp toward them,\nconveyed a queer suggestion of weariness or weakness, as if he were yet\nnot wholly roused from his two millenia of slumber. But the Ryzga's\nmanner and his mind radiated a consciousness of power, a pride and\nassurance of self that smote them like a numbing blow.\n\nWith a new shock, Var realized that the Ryzga's thoughts were quite\nopen. They had a terse, disconnected quality that was strange and\nunsettling, and in part they were couched in alien and unintelligible\nsymbols. But there was no block. Apparently the Ryzga felt no need to\nclose his mind in the presence of inferior creatures....\n\nHe paused with his back to the central control panel, and studied the\ninterlopers with the dispassionate gaze of a scientist examining a new,\nbut not novel, species of insect. His thoughts seemed to click, like\nmetal parts of a mechanism falling into places prepared for them. The\nimage occurred oddly to Var, to whom such a comparison would ordinarily\nhave been totally strange.\n\n\"Culture: late barbarism. Handwork of high quality--good. Physically\nexcellent stock....\" There was a complicated and incomprehensible\nschemata of numbers and abstract forms. \"The time: two thousand\nyears--more progress might have been expected, if any survivors at all\ninitially postulated; but this will do. The pessimists were mistaken. We\ncan begin again.\" Then, startlingly super-imposed on the cool\nprogression of logical thought, came a wave of raw emotion, devastating\nin its force. It was a lustful image of a world once more obedient,\ncrawling, laboring to do the Ryzgas' will--_toward the stars, the\nstars!_ The icy calculation resumed: \"Immobilize these and the ones\nindicated in the passage above. Then wake the rest....\"\n\nVar was staring in fascination at the Ryzga's face. It was a face formed\nby the custom of unquestioned command; yet it was lined by a deeply\ningrained weariness, the signs of premature age--denied, overridden by\nthe driving will they had sensed a moment earlier. It was a sick man's\nface.\n\nThe Ryzga's final thought clicked into place: _Decision!_ He turned\ntoward the switchboard behind him, reaching with practised certainty for\none spot upon it.\n\nNeena screamed.\n\nBetween the Ryzga and the control panel a nightmare shape reared up\nseven feet tall, flapping black amorphous limbs and flashing red eyes\nand white fangs. The Ryzga recoiled, and the weapon in his hand came up.\nThere was an instantaneous glare like heat lightning, and the monster\ncrumpled in on itself, twitched briefly and vanished.\n\nBut in that moment a light of inspiration had flashed upon Var, and it\nremained. As the Ryzga stretched out his hand again, Var acted. The\nRyzga froze, teetering off balance and almost falling, as a numbing grip\nclosed down on all his motor nerves.\n\nHolding that grip, Var strode across the floor and looked straight into\nthe Ryzga's frantic eyes. They glared back at him with such hatred and\nsuch evil that for an instant he almost faltered. But the Ryzga's\nefforts, as he strove to free himself from the neural hold, were as\nmisdirected and unavailing as those of a child who has not learned to\nwrestle with the mind.\n\nVar had guessed right. When Neena in her terror had flung a dream\nmonster into the Ryzga's way--a mere child's bogey out of a fairy\ntale--the Ryzga had not recognized it as such, but had taken it for a\nreal being. Var laughed aloud, and with great care, as one communicates\nwith an infant, he projected his thoughts into the other's mind. \"There\nwill be no new beginning for you in _our_ world, Ryzga! In two thousand\nyears, we've learned some new things. Now at last I understand why you\nbuilt so many machines, such complicated arrangements of matter and\nenergy to do simple tasks--it was because you knew no other way.\"\n\nBehind the hate-filled eyes the cold brain tried to reason still.\n\"Barbarians...? Our party was wrong after all. After us the machine\ncivilization could never rise again, because it was a fire that consumed\nits fuel. After us _man_ could not survive on the Earth, because the\nconditions that made him great were gone. The survivors must be\nsomething else--capacities undeveloped by our science--after us the end\nof man, the beginning.... But those of us who chose to die were right.\"\n\nThe tide of hate and sick desire rose up to drown all coherence. The\nRyzga made a savage, wholly futile effort to lift the weapon in his\nparalyzed hand. Then his eyes rolled upward, and abruptly he went limp\nand fell in a heap, like a mechanical doll whose motive power has\nfailed.\n\nVar felt Neena beside him, and drew her close. As she sobbed her relief,\nhe continued to look down absently at the dead man. When at last he\nraised his head, he saw that the drama's end had had a further audience.\nIn the outer doorway, backed by his clansmen, stood Groz, gazing first\nin stupefaction at the fallen Ryzga, then with something like awe at\nVar.\n\nVar eyed him for a long moment; then he smiled, and asked, \"Well, Groz?\nIs our feud finished, or does your ambition for a worthy son-in-law go\nbeyond the conqueror of the Ryzgas?\"\n\n\n\n\n",
