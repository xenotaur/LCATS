    "body": "The Secretary of Defense, flown in by special plane from the new Capitol\nBuilding in Denver, trotted down the ramp with his right hand\noutstretched before him.\n\nAt the base of the ramp his hand was touched, clutched and hidden by the\nright hand of General \"Smiley\" Webb in a hearty parody of a casual\nhandshake. General Webb did everything in a big way, and that included\neven little things like handshakes.\n\nRetrieving his hand once more, James Whitlow, the Secretary of Defense,\nsmiled nervously with his tiny mouth, and said,\n\n\"Well, here I am.\"\n\nThis statement was taken down by a hovering circle of news reporters,\ndispatched by wireless and telephone to every town in the forty-nine\nstates, expanded, contracted, quoted and misquoted, ignored and\nmisconstrued, and then forgotten; all this in a matter of hours.\n\nThe nation, hearing it, put aside its wonted trepidations, took an extra\ntranquilizer or two, and felt secure once more. The government was in\ngood hands.\n\n\n\nLeaving the reporters in a disgruntled group beyond the\ncyclone-fence-and-barbed-wire barriers surrounding Project W, General\nWebb, seated beside Whitlow in the back of his private car, sighed and\nfolded his arms.\n\n\"You'll be amazed!\" he chortled, nudging his companion with a bony\nelbow.\n\n\"I--I expect so,\" said Whitlow, clinging to his brief case with both\nhands. It contained, among other things, a volume of mystery stories and\na ham sandwich, neatly packaged in aluminum foil. Whitlow didn't want to\nchance losing it. Not, at least, until he'd eaten the sandwich.\n\n\"Of course, you're wondering where I got the idea for my project,\" said\n\"Smiley\" Webb, adding, for the benefit of his driver, \"Keep your eyes on\nthe road, Sergeant! The WAC barracks will still be there when you get\noff duty!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" came a hollow grunt from the front seat.\n\n\"Weren't you?\" asked General Webb, gleaming a toothy smile in Whitlow's\ndirection.\n\n\"Weren't I _what_?\" Whitlow asked miserably, having lost the thread of\ntheir conversation due to a surreptitious glance backward at the WAC\nbarracks in their wake.\n\n\"Wondering about the project!\" snapped the general.\n\n\"Yes. We _all_ were,\" said the Secretary of Defense, appending somewhat\ntartly, \"That's why they _sent_ me here.\"\n\n\"To be sure. To be sure,\" General Webb muttered. He didn't much like\ntartness in responses, but the Secretary of Defense, unfortunately, was\nhardly a subordinate, and therefore not subject to the general's choler.\nSilly little ass! he said to himself. Rather liking the sound of the\nwords--albeit in his mind--he repeated them over again, adding\nembellishments like \"pompous\" and \"mousy\" and \"squirrel-eyed.\" After\nthree or four such thoughts, the general felt much better.\n\n\"_I_ thought the whole thing up, myself,\" he said, proudly.\n\n\"I wish you'd stop being so ambiguous,\" Whitlow protested in a small\nvoice. \"Just what _is_ this project? How does it work? Will it help us\nwin the war?\"\n\n\"_Sssh!_\" said the general, jerking a quivering forefinger perpendicular\nbefore pursed lips. \"Security!\"\n\nHe closed one eye in a broad wink and wriggled a thumb in the direction\nof the driver. \"He's only cleared for Confidential material,\" said the\ngeneral, his tone casting aspersions on the sergeant's patriotism,\nancestry and personal hygiene. \"This project is, of course, _Top\nSecret_!\" He said the words reverently, his face going all noble and\nbrave. Whitlow half-expected him to remove his hat, but he did not.\n\n\n\nThey drove onward, then, in silence, until they passed by a large field,\nin the center of which Whitlow could discern the outlines of an immense\nbull's-eye, in front of a tall, somewhat rickety khaki-colored reviewing\nstand, draped in tired bunting.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Whitlow, relinquishing his grip on his brief case\nlong enough to point toward the field.\n\n\"_Ssssh!_\" said \"Smiley\" Webb. \"You'll find out in a matter of hours.\"\n\n\"Many hours?\" Whitlow asked, thinking of the ham sandwich.\n\nGeneral Webb consulted a magnificent platinum timepiece anchored to his\nthick hairy wrist by a stout leather strap.\n\n\"In exactly one hour, thirty-seven minutes, and\nforty-three-point-oh-oh-nine seconds!\" he said, proudly.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Whitlow sighed. \"You're certainly running this\nthing--whatever it is--in an efficient manner.\"\n\n\"Thank _you_!\" General Webb glowed. \"We like to think so,\" he added\nmodestly.\n\n\n\nPasswords, signs, countersigns, combination-locks and electronic\nrecognition signals were negotiated one by one, until Whitlow was\ndespairing of ever getting into the heart of Project W. He said as much\nto General Webb, who merely flashed the grin which gave him his\nnickname, and opened a final door.\n\nFor a moment, Whitlow thought he was going deaf. The shrill roar of\nscreeching metal and throbbing dynamos that pounded at his eardrums\nbegan to fuddle his mind, until General Webb handed him a small\ncardboard box--also stamped, like every door and wall in the place, \"Top\nSecret\"--in which his trembling fingers located two ordinary rubber\nearplugs, which he instantly put to good use.\n\n\"There she is!\" said General Webb, proudly, gesturing over the railing\nof the small balcony upon which they stood. \"The Whirligig!\"\n\n\"What?\" called Secretary of Defense Whitlow, shaking his head to\nindicate he hadn't heard a word.\n\nSomewhat piqued, but resigned, General Webb leaned his wide mouth nearly\nup against Whitlow's small pink plugged ear, and roared the same\ninformation at the top of his lungs.\n\nWhitlow, a little stunned by the volume despite the plugs, nodded\nwearily, to indicate that he'd heard, then asked, in a high, piping\nvoice, \"What's it for?\"\n\nWebb's eyes bulged in their sockets. \"Great heavens, man, can't you\n_see_?\" He gestured down at his creation, his baby, his project, as\nthough it were self-evident what its function was.\n\nWhitlow strained his eyes to divine anything that might give a clue as\nto just what the government had been pouring money into for the past\neight months. All he saw was what appeared to be a sort of ferris-wheel,\nexcept that it was revolving in a horizontal plane. The structure was\ncompletely enclosed in metal, and was whirling too fast for even the\ncentral shaft to be anything but a hazy, silver-blue blur.\n\n\"I see it,\" he shouted, squeakily. \"But I don't understand it!\"\n\n\"Come with me,\" said General Webb, re-opening the door at their backs.\nHe was just about to step through when, with a quick blush of\nmortification, he remembered the \"Top Secret\" earplugs. Hastily,\naverting his face lest the other man see his embarrassment, he returned\nhis plugs to their box, and did the same with Whitlow's.\n\nWhitlow was glad when the door closed behind them.\n\n\"My office is this way,\" said Webb, striding off in a stiff military\nmanner.\n\nWhitlow, with a forlorn shrug, could do nothing but clutch his brief\ncase and follow.\n\n\n\n\"It's this way,\" General Webb began, once they were seated uncomfortably\nin his office. From a pocket in his khaki jacket, Webb had produced a\nbig-bowled calabash pipe, and was puffing its noxious gray fumes in all\ndirections while he spoke. \"Up until the late fifties, war was a simple\nthing ...\"\n\nOh, not the March of Science Speech! said Whitlow to himself. He knew it\nby heart. It was the talk of the Capitol, and the nightmare of military\nstrategists. As the general's voice droned on and on, Whitlow barely\nlistened. The general, Top Secret or no Top Secret, was divulging\nnothing that wasn't common knowledge from the ruins of Philadelphia to\nthe great Hollywood crater ...\n\nAll at once, weapons had gotten _too_ good. That was the whole problem.\nWars, no matter what the abilities of the death-dealing guns, cannon,\nrifles, rockets or whatever, needed one thing on the battlefield that\ncould not be turned out in a factory: Men.\n\nIn order to win a war, a country must be vanquished. In order to\nvanquish a country, soldiers must be landed. And that was precisely\nwherein the difficulty lay: landing the soldiers.\n\nShips were nearly obsolete in this respect. Landing barges could be\nblown out of the water as fast as they were let down into it.\n\nParatroops were likewise hopeless. The slow-moving troop-carrying planes\ndaren't even peek above the enemy's horizon without chancing an\nonslaught of \"thinking\" rockets that would stay on their trail until\nthey were molten cinders falling into the sea.\n\nSo someone invented the supersonic carrier. This was pretty good,\nallowing the planes to come in high and fast over the enemy's territory,\nas fast as the land-to-air missiles themselves. The only drawback was\nthat the first men to try parachuting at that speed were battered to\nconfetti by the slipstream of their own carriers. That would not do.\n\nNext, someone thought of the capsules. Each man was packed into a\nbreak-proof, shock-proof, water-proof, wind-proof plastic capsule, and\nejected safely beyond the slipstream area of the carriers, at which\npoint, each capsule sprouted a silken chute that lowered the enclosed\nmen gently down into range of the enemy's rocket-fire ...\n\nThis plan was scrapped like the others.\n\nAnd so, things were at a stalemate. There hadn't been a really good\nskirmish for nearly five years. War was hardly anything but a memory,\nwhat with both sides practically omnipotent. Unless troops could be\nlanded, war was downright impossible. And, no one could land troops, so\nthere was no war.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Whitlow _liked_ the state of affairs. To be\nSecretary of Defense during a years-long peace was a soft job to top all\nsoft jobs. And Whitlow didn't much like war. He'd rather live peacefully\nwith his mystery stories and ham sandwiches.\n\nBut the Capitol, under the relentless lobbying of the munitions\ninterests, was trying to find a way to get a war started.\n\nThey _had_ tried simply bombing the other countries, but it hadn't\nworked out too well: the other countries had bombed back.\n\nThis plan had been scrapped as too dangerous.\n\nAnd then, just when all seemed lost, when it looked as though mankind\nwas doomed to eternal peace ...\n\nAlong came General \"Smiley\" Webb.\n\n\"Land troops?\" he'd said, confidently, \"nothing easier. With the\ngovernment's cooperation, I can have our troops in any country in the\nworld, safely landed, within the space of one year!\"\n\nCongress had voted him the money unanimously, and off he'd gone to work\nat Project W. No one knew _quite_ what it was about, but the general had\nseemed so self-assured that-- Well, they'd almost forgotten about him\nuntil some ambitious clerk, trying to balance at least _part_ of the\nbudget, had discovered a monthly expenditure to an obscure base in the\nsouthwest totalling some millions of dollars. Perfunctory checking had\nbrought out the fact that \"Smiley\" Webb had been drawing this money\nevery month, and hadn't as much as mailed in a single progress report.\n\nThere'd been swift phone-calls from Denver to Project W, and, General\nWebb informed them, not only was all the money to be accounted for, but\nso was all the time and effort: the project was completed, and about to\nbe tested. Would someone like to come down and watch?\n\nSomeone would.\n\n\n\nAnd thus it was that James Whitlow, with mystery stories and ham\nsandwich, had taken the first plane from the Capitol ...\n\n\"... when all at once, I thought: Speed! Endurance! _That_ is the\nproblem!\" said Webb, breaking in on Whitlow's reverie.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said the Secretary of Defense.\n\nWebb whacked the dottle out of his pipe into a meaty palm, tossed the\nsmoking cinders rather carelessly into a waste-basket, and leaned\nforward to confront the other man face to face, their noses almost\nnudging.\n\n\"Why are parachutes out?\" he snapped.\n\n\"They go too slow,\" said Whitlow.\n\n\"Why do we use parachutes at all?\"\n\n\"To keep the men from getting killed by the fall.\"\n\n\"Why does a fall kill the men?\"\n\n\"It-- It breaks their bones and stuff.\"\n\n\"_Bah!_\" Webb scoffed.\n\n\"Bah?\" reiterated Whitlow. \"Bah?\"\n\n\"Certainly bah!\" said the general. \"All it takes is a little training.\"\n\n\n\n\"All _what_ takes?\" said Whitlow, helplessly.\n\n\"Falling, man, falling!\" the general boomed. \"If a man can fall safely\nfrom ten feet-- Why not from ten times ten feet!?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Whitlow, \"increasing height accelerates the _rate_ of\nfalling, and--\"\n\n\"_Poppycock!_\" the general roared.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Whitlow, somewhat cowed.\n\n\"Muscle-building. That's the secret. Endurance. Stress. Strain.\nTension.\"\n\n\"If-- If you say so ...\" said Whitlow, slumping lower and lower in his\nchair as the general's massive form leaned precariously over him.\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Of _course_ you are puzzled,\" said the general, suddenly chummy.\n\"Anyone would be. Until they realized the use to which I've put the\nWhirligig!\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I suppose so ...\" said Whitlow, thinking longingly of his ham\nsandwich, and its crunchy, moist green smear of pickle relish.\n\n\"The first day--\" said General Webb, \"it revolved at _one_ gravity! They\nwithstood it!\"\n\n\"What did? Who withstood? When?\" asked Whitlow, with much confusion.\n\n\"The men!\" said the general, irritably. \"The men in the Whirligig!\"\n\nWhitlow jerked bolt upright. \"There are _men_ in that thing?\" It's not\npossible, he thought.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Webb, soothingly. \"But they're all right. They've been\nin there for thirty days, whirling around at one gravity more each day.\nWe have constant telephone communication with them. They're all feeling\nfine, just fine.\"\n\n\"But--\" Whitlow said, weakly.\n\nGeneral Webb had him firmly by the arm, and was leading him out of the\noffice. \"We must get to the stands, man. Operation Human Bomb in ten\nminutes.\"\n\n\"Bomb?\" Whitlow squeaked, scurrying alongside Webb as the larger man\nstrode down the echoing corridor.\n\n\"A euphemism, of course,\" said Webb. \"Because they will fall much like a\nbomb does. But they will not explode! No, they will land, rifles in\nhand, ready to take over the enemy territory.\"\n\n\"Without parachutes?\" Whitlow marveled.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the general, leading the way out into the blinding\ndesert sunlight. \"You see,\" he remarked, as they strolled toward the\nheat-shimmering outlines of the reviewing stand, its bunting hanging\nlimp and faded in the dry, breezeless air, \"it's really so simple I'm\nastonished the enemy didn't think of it first. Though, of course, I'm\nglad they didn't-- Ha! ha!\" He oozed self-appreciation.\n\n\"Ha ha,\" repeated Whitlow, with little enthusiasm.\n\n\"When one is whirled at one gravity, you see, the wall--the outside\nrim--of the Whirligig, becomes the floor for the men inside. Each day,\nthey have spent up to ten hours doing nothing but deep knee-bends, and\neating high protein foods. Their legs will be able to withstand _any_\nforce of landing. If they can do deep knee-bends at thirty\ngravities--during which, of course, each of them weighed nearly three\ntons--they can jump from any height and survive. Good, huh?\"\n\n\n\nWhitlow was worried as they clambered up into the stands. There seemed\nto be no one about but the two of them.\n\n\"Who else is coming?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just us,\" said Webb. \"I'm the only one with a clearance high enough to\nwatch this. You're only here because you're _my_ guest.\"\n\n\"But--\" said Whitlow, observing the heat-baked wide-open spaces\nextending on all sides of the reviewing stand and bull's-eye, \"the men\non this base can surely watch from almost anywhere not beyond the\nhorizon.\"\n\n\"They'd _better_ not!\" was the general's only comment.\n\n\"Well,\" said Whitlow, \"what happens now?\"\n\n\"The men that were in that Whirligig have--since you and I went to my\noffice to chat--been transported to the airfield, from which point they\nwere taken aloft--\" he consulted his watch, \"five minutes, and\nfifty-five-point-six seconds ago.\"\n\n\"And?\" asked Whitlow, casually unbuckling the straps of his brief case\nand slipping out his sandwich.\n\n\"The plane will be within bomb vector of this target in just ten\nseconds!\" said Webb, confidently.\n\nWhitlow listened, for the next nine seconds, then, right on schedule, he\nheard the muted droning of a plane, high up. Webb joggled him with an\nelbow. \"They'll fall faster than any known enemy weapon can track them,\"\nhe said, smugly.\n\n\"That's fortunate,\" said Whitlow, munching desultorily at his sandwich.\n\"Bud dere's wud thig budduhs bee.\"\n\n\"Hmmf?\" asked the general.\n\nWhitlow swallowed hastily. \"I say, there's one thing bothers me.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked the general.\n\n\"Well, it's just that gravity is centripetal, you know, and the\nWhirligig is centrifugal. I wondered if it might not make some sort of\ndifference?\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said General Webb. \"Just a minor detail.\"\n\n\"If you say so,\" Whitlow shrugged.\n\n\"There they come!\" shouted the general, jumping to his feet.\n\nWhitlow, despite his misgivings, found that he, too, was on his feet,\nstaring skyward at the tiny dots that were detaching themselves from the\nshining bulk of the carrier plane. As he watched, his heart beating\nmadly, the dots grew bigger, and soon, awfully soon, they could be\ndistinguished as man-shaped, too.\n\n\"There's-- There's something wrong!\" said the general. \"What's that\nthey're all shouting? It _should_ be 'Geronimo' ...\"\n\nWhitlow listened. \"It sounds more like 'Eeeeeyaaaaa',\" he said.\n\nAnd it was.\n\nThe sound grew from a distant mumble to a shrieking roar, and the next\nthing, each man had landed upon the concrete-and-paint bull's-eye before\nthe reviewing stand.\n\nWhitlow sighed and re-buckled his brief case.\n\nThe general moaned and fainted.\n\nAnd the men of the Whirligig, all of whom had landed on the target\nhead-first, did nothing, their magnificently muscled legs waving idly in\na sudden gentle gust of desert breeze.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
