The old man smiled. \"I\nspeck 'twuz one time er two times, er maybe a time an' a half. You know\nwhen Johnny Ashcake 'gun ter bake? Well, 'twuz 'long in dem days. Once\n'pon a time,\" he resumed, \"Mr. Man had a gyarden so fine dat all de\nneighbors come ter see it. Some 'ud look at it over de fence, some 'ud\npeep thoo de cracks, an' some 'ud come an' look at it by de light er de\nstars. An' one un um wuz ol' Brer Rabbit; starlight, moonlight,\ncloudlight, de nightlight wuz de light fer him. When de turn er de\nmornin' come, he 'uz allers up an' about, an' a-feelin' purty well I\nthank you, suh!\n\n\"Now, den, you done hear what I say. Dar wuz Mr. Man, yander wuz de\ngyarden, an' here wuz ol' Brer Rabbit.\" Uncle Remus made a map of this\npart of the story by marking in the sand with his walking-cane. \"Well,\ndis bein' de case, what you speck gwineter happen? Nothin' in de roun'\nworl' but what been happenin' sence greens an' sparrer-grass wuz planted\nin de groun'. Dey look fine an' dey tas'e fine, an' long to'rds de shank\ner de mornin', Brer Rabbit 'ud creep thoo de crack er de fence an'\nnibble at um. He'd take de greens, but leave his tracks, mo' speshually\nright atter a rain. Takin' an' leavin'--it's de way er de worl'.\n\n\"Well, one mornin', Mr. Man went out in his truck patch, an' he fin'\nsump'n missin'--a cabbage here, a turnip dar, an' a mess er beans\nyander, an' he ax how come dis? He look 'roun', he did, an' he seed Brer\nRabbit's tracks what he couldn't take wid 'im. Brer Rabbit had lef' his\nshoes at home, an' come bar'footed.\n\n\"So Mr. Man, he call his dogs 'Here, Buck! Here, Brinjer! Here, Blue!'\nan' he sicc'd um on de track, an' here dey went!\n\n\"You'd 'a' thunk dey wuz runnin' atter forty-lev'm rhinossyhosses fum de\nfuss dey made. Brer Rabbit he hear um comin' an' he put out fer home,\nkinder doublin' 'roun' des like he do deze days.\n\n\"When he got ter de p'int whar he kin set down fer ter rest his face an'\nhan's, he tuck a poplar leaf an' 'gun ter fan hisse'f. Den Brer Fox come\na-trottin' up. He say, 'Brer Rabbit, what's all dis fuss I hear in de\nwoods? What de name er goodness do it mean?' Brer Rabbit kinder scratch\nhis head an' 'low, 'Why, deyer tryin' fer drive me ter de big bobbycue\non de creek. Dey all ax me, an' when I 'fuse dey say deyer gwine ter\nmake me go any how. Dey aint no fun in bein' ez populous ez what I is,\nBrer Fox. Ef you wanter go, des git in ahead er de houn's an' go\nlickity-split down de big road!'\n\n\"Brer Fox roll his little eyes, an' lick his chops whar he dribble at de\nmouf, an put out ter de bobbycue, an' he aint mo' dan made his\ndisappearance, 'fo' here come Brer Wolf, an' when he got de news, off he\nput.\n\n\"An' he aint mo'n got out'n sight, 'fo' here come ol' Brer B'ar, an'\nwhen he hear talk er de bakin' meat an' de big pan er gravy, he sot up\non his behime legs an' snored. Den off he put, an' he aint got out'n\nhearin', 'fo' Brer Coon come rackin' up, an' when he got de news, he put\nout.\n\n\"So dar dey wuz an' what you gwine do 'bout it? It seem like dey all got\nin front er de dogs, er de dogs got behime um, an' Brer Rabbit sot by de\ncreek-side laughin' an' hittin' at de snake doctors. An' dem po'\ncreeturs had ter go clean past de bobbycue--ef dey wuz any bobbycue,\nwhich I don't skacely speck dey wuz. Dat what make me say what I\ndoes--when you git a invite ter a bobbycue, you better fin' out when an'\nwhar it's at, an' who runnin' it.\"\n\n\n\n\nBRER RABBIT'S FROLIC\n\nThe little boy, when he next saw Uncle Remus, after hearing how the\nanimals went to the barbecue, wanted to know what happened to them: he\nwas anxious to learn if any of them were hurt by the dogs that had been\nchasing Brother Rabbit. The old darkey closed his eyes and chuckled.\n\"You sho is axin' sump'n now, honey. Und' his hat, ef he had any, Brer\nRabbit had a mighty quick thinkin' apple-ratus, an' mos' inginner'lly,\nall de time, de pranks he played on de yuther creeturs pestered um bofe\nways a-comin' an' a-gwine. De dogs done mighty well, 'long ez dey had\ndealin's wid de small fry, like Brer Fox, an' Brer Coon, an' Brer Wolf,\nbut when dey run ag'in' ol' Brer B'ar, dey sho struck a snag. De mos'\nservigrous wuz de identual one dat got de wust hurted. He got too close\nter Brer B'ar, an' when he look at hisse'f in runnin' water, he tuck\nnotice dat he wuz split wide open fum flank ter dewlap.\n\n\"Atter de rucus wuz over, de creeturs hobbled off home de best dey\ncould, an' laid 'roun' in sun an' shade fer ter let der cuts an' gashes\ngit good an' well. When dey got so dey could segashuate, an' pay der\nparty calls, dey 'gree fer ter insemble some'rs, an' hit on some plan\nfer ter outdo Brer Rabbit. Well, dey had der insembly, an' dey jower'd\nan' jower'd des like yo' pa do when he aint feelin' right well; but,\nbimeby, dey 'greed 'pon a plan dat look like it mought work. Dey 'gree\nfer ter make out dat dey gwine ter have a dance. Dey know'd dat ol' Brer\nRabbit wuz allers keen fer dat, an' dey say dey'll gi' him a invite, an'\nwhen he got dar, dey'd ax 'im fer ter play de fiddle, an' ef he 'fuse,\ndey'll close in on 'im an' make way wid 'im.\n\n\"So fur, so good! But all de time dey wuz jowerin' an' confabbin', ol'\nBrer Rabbit wus settin' in a shady place in de grass, a-hearin' eve'y\nword dey say. When de time come, he crope out, he did, an' run 'roun',\nan' de fust news dey know'd, here he come down de big\nroad--bookity-bookity--same ez a hoss dat's broke thoo de pastur' fence.\nHe say, sezee, 'Why, hello, frien's! an' howdy, too, kaze I aint seed\nyou-all sence de last time! Whar de name er goodness is you been deze\nodd-come-shorts? an' how did you far' at de bobbycue? Ef my two eyeballs\naint gone an' got crooked, dar's ol' Brer B'ar, him er de short tail an'\nsharp tush--de ve'y one I'm a-huntin' fer! An' dar's Brer Coon! I sho is\nin big luck. Dar's gwineter be a big frolic at Miss Meadows', an' her\nan' de gals want Brer B'ar fer ter show um de roas'n'-y'ar shuffle; an'\ndey put Brer Coon down fer de jig dey calls rack-back-Davy.\n\n\"'I'm ter play de fiddle--sump'n I aint done sence my oldest gal had de\nmumps an' de measles, bofe de same day an' hour! Well, dis mornin' I\ntuck down de fiddle fum whar she wuz a-hangin' at, an' draw'd de bow\nbackerds an' forerds a time er two, an' den I shot my eyes an' hit some\ner de ol'-time chunes, an' when I come ter myse'f, dar wuz my whole\nblessed fambly skippin' an' sasshayin' 'roun' de room, spite er de fack\ndat brekkus wuz ter be cooked!'\n\n\"Wid dat, Brer Rabbit bow'd, he did, an' went back down de road like de\ndogs wuz atter 'im.\"\n\n\"But what happened then?\" the little boy asked. \"Nothin' 't all,\"\nreplied Uncle Remus, taking up the chuckle where he had left off. \"De\ncreeturs aint had no dance, an' when dey went ter Miss Meadows', she put\nher head out de winder, an' say ef dey don't go off fum dar she'll have\nde law on um!\"\n\n\n\n\nBROTHER BEAR'S BIG HOUSE\n\n\"Uv all de creeturs\", said Uncle Remus, in response to a questioning\ntook on the part of the little boy, \"ol Brer B'ar had de biggest an' de\nwarmest house. I dunner why ner wharfo', but I'm a-tellin' you de plain\nfack, des ez dey to!' it unter me. Ef I kin he'p it I never will be\ndeceivin' you, ner lead you inter no bad habits. Yo' pappy trotted wid\nme a mighty long time, an' ef you'll ax him he'll tell you dat de one\nthing I never did do wuz ter deceive him whiles he had his eyes open;\nnot ef I knows myse'f. Well, ol' Brer B'ar had de big house I'm\na-tellin' you about. Ef he y'ever is brag un it, it aint never come down\nter me. Yit dat's des what he had--a big house an' plenty er room fer\nhim an' his fambly; an' he aint had mo' dan he need, kaze all er his\nfambly wuz fat an' had what folks calls heft--de nachal plunkness.\n\n\"He had a son name Simmon, an' a gal name Sue, not countin' his ol'\n'oman, an' dey all live wid one an'er day atter day, an' night atter\nnight; an' when one un um went abroad, dey'd be spected home 'bout\nmeal-time, ef not befo', an' dey segashuated right along fum day ter\nday, washin' der face an' han's in de same wash-pan in de back po'ch,\nan' wipin' on de same towel same ez all happy famblies allers does.\n\n\"Well, time went on an' fotched de changes dat might be spected, an' one\nday dar come a mighty knockin' on Brer B'ar's do'. Brer B'ar, he holla\nout, he did. 'Who dat come a-knockin' dis time er de year, 'fo' de\ncorn's done planted, er de cotton-crap's pitched?' De one at de do' make\na big noise, an' rattle de hinges. Brer B'ar holla out, he did, 'Don't\nt'ar down my house! Who is you, anyhow, an' what you want?' An' de\nanswer come, 'I'm one an' darfo' not two; ef youer mo' dan one, who is\nyou an' what you doin' in dar?' Brer B'ar, he say, sezee, 'I'm all er\none an' mighty nigh two, but I'd thank you fer ter tell me yo' full\nfambly name.' Den de answer come.\n\n\"'I'm de knocker an' de mover bofe, an' ef I can't clim' over I'll crawl\nunder ef you do but gi' me de word. Some calls me Brer Polecat, an' some\na big word dat it aint wuff while ter ermember, but I wanter move in.\nIt's mighty col' out here, an' all I meets tells me it's mighty warm in\ndar whar you is.' Den ol' Brer B'ar say, sezee. 'It's warm nuff fer dem\nwhat stays in here, but not nigh so warm fer dem on de outside. What\ndoes you reely want?' Brer Polecat 'spon', he did, 'I wants a heap er\nthings dat I don't git. I'm a mighty good housekeeper, but I takes\nnotice dat dar's mighty few folks dat wants me ter keep house fer um.'\nBrer B'ar say, sezee, 'I aint got no room fer no housekeeper; we aint\nskacely got room fer ter go ter bed. Ef you kin keep my house on de\noutside, you er mighty welcome.'\n\n\"Brer Polecat say, 'You may think you aint got no room, but I bet you\ngot des ez much room ez anybody what I know. Ef you let me in dar one\ntime, I boun' you I'll make all de room I want.'\"\n\nUncle Remus paused to see what effect this statement would have on the\nlittle boy. He closed his eyes, as though he were tired, but when he\nopened them again, he saw the faint shadow of a smile on the child's\nface. \"'Taint gwine ter hurt you fer ter laugh a little bit, honey. Brer\nPolecat come in Brer B'ar's house, an' he had sech a bad breff dat dey\nall hatter git out--an' he stayed an' stayed twel time stopped runnin'\nag'in' him.\"\n\n\n\n\nBRER RABBIT TREATS THE CREETURS TO A RACE\n\nOne sultry summer day, while the little boy was playing not far from\nUncle Remus's cabin, a heavy black cloud made its appearance in the\nwest, and quickly obscured the sky. It sent a brisk gale before it, as\nif to clear the path of leaves and dust. Presently there was a blinding\nflash of lightning, a snap and a crash, and, with that, the child took\nto his heels, and ran to Uncle Remus, who was standing in his door. \"Dar\nnow!\" he exclaimed, before the echoes of the thunder had rolled away,\n\"Dat dust an' win', an' rain, puts me in mind er de time when ol' Brer\nRabbit got up a big race fer ter pleasure de yuther creeturs. It wuz de\nmos' funniest race you ever hear tell on. Brer Rabbit went 'way off in\nde woods twel he come ter de Rainmaker's house. He knocked an' went in,\nan' he ax de Rainmaker ef he can't fix it up so dey kin have a race\n'tween Brer Dust an' Cousin Rain, fer ter see which kin run de fastes'.\nDe Rainmaker growled an' jowered, but bimeby he 'gree, but he say that\nef 'twuz anybody but Brer Rabbit, he wouldn't gi' it but one thunk.\n\n\"Well, dey fix de day, dey did, an' den Brer Rabbit put out ter whar de\ncreeturs wuz stayin' at, an' tol' um de news. Dey dunner how Brer Rabbit\nknow, but dey all wanter see de race. Now, him an' de Rainmaker had fixt\nit up so dat de race would be right down de middle er de big road, an'\nwhen de day come, dar's whar he made de creeturs stan'--Brer B'ar at de\nbend er de road, Brer Wolf a leetle furder off, an' Brer Fox at a p'int\nwhar de cross-roads wuz. Brer Coon an' Brer Possum an' de yuthers be\nscattered about up an' down de Road.\n\n\"Ter dem what has ter wait, it seem like de sun stops an' all de clocks\nwid 'im. Brer B'ar done some growlin'; Brer Wolf some howlin' an' Brer\nPossum some laughin'; but atter while a cloud come up fum some'rs.\n'Twant sech a big cloud, but Brer Rabbit know'd dat Cousin Rain wuz in\ndar 'long wid Uncle Win'. De cloud crope up, it did, twel it got right\nover de big road, an' den it kinder drapped down a leetle closer ter de\ngroun'. It look like it kinder stop, like a buggy, fer Cousin Rain ter\ngit out, so der'd be a fa'r start. Well, he got out, kaze de creeturs\nkin see 'im, an' den Uncle Win', he got out.\n\n\"An' den, gentermens! de race begun fer ter commence. Uncle Win' hep'd\num bofe; he had his bellows wid 'im, an' he blow'd it! Brer Dust got up\nfum whar he wuz a-layin' at, an' come down de road des a-whirlin'. He\nstricken ol' Brer B'ar fust, den Brer Wolf, an' den Brer Fox, an' atter\ndat, all de yuther creeturs, an' it come mighty nigh smifflicatin' um!\nNot never in all yo' born days is you y'ever heern sech coughin' an'\nsneezin', sech snortin' an' wheezin'! An' dey all look like dey wuz\npainted red. Brer B'ar sneeze so hard dat he hatter lay down in de road,\nan' Brer Dust come mighty nigh buryin' 'im, an' 'twuz de same wid de\nyuther creeturs--dey got der y'ears, der noses, an' der eyeses full.\n\n\"An' den Cousin Rain come 'long, a-pursuin' Brer Dust, an' he come\nmighty nigh drownin' um. He left um kivver'd wid mud, an' dey wuz wuss\noff dan befo'. It wuz de longest 'fo' dey kin git de mud out 'n der eyes\nan' y'ears, an' when dey git so dey kin see a leetle bit, dey tuck\nnotice dat Brer Rabbit, stidder bein' full er mud, wuz ez dry ez a chip,\nef not dryer.\n\n\"It make um so mad, dat dey all put out atter 'im, an' try der level\nbest fer ter ketch, but ef dey wuz anything in de roun' worl' dat Brer\nRabbit's got, it's soople foots, an' 'twant no time 'fo' de yuther\ncreeturs can't see ha'r ner hide un 'im! All de same Brer Rabbit aint\nbargain fer ter have two races de same day.\"\n\n\"But, Uncle Remus,\" said the little boy, \"which beat, Brother Dust or\nCousin Rain?\" The old man stirred uneasily in his chair, and rubbed his\nchin with his hand. \"Dey tells me,\" he responded cautiously, \"dat when\nCousin Rain can't see nothin' er Brother Dust, he thunk he am beat, but\nhe holla out, 'Brer Dust, wharbouts is you?' an' Brer Dust he holla\nback, 'You'll hatter scuzen me; I fell down in de mud an' can't run no\nmo'!'\"\n\n\n\n\nBRER RABBIT'S FLYING TRIP\n\n    Dar once wuz a time when most er de creeturs\n      Got mighty tired er Brer Rabbit's capers,\n    An' dey 'semble', dey did, grass an' meat eaters.\n      Browsers an' grazers, an' likewiss de bone-scrapers,\n            Fer ter see what dey kin do.\n\n    Brer B'ar wuz dar, wid his bid fur suit on,\n      An' ol' Brer Wolf fetched his big howl along,\n    An' when eve'ything wuz ready, wid a long, loud hoot on,\n      Here come ol' Simon Swamp Owl along,\n            A-tootin' of his too-whoo.\n\n    Dar wuz ol' Brer Fox, suh, wid his black socks, suh,\n      An' a heap er creeturs dat I don't hatter mention;\n    Some bow-legged an' some knock-kneed in de hocks, suh.\n      An' dey all agree fer ter hol' a convention\n            Fer ter stop Brer Rabbit's pranks.\n\n    Brer Fox, he 'low he'll gi' a pot er gol', suh,\n      Ter de man what kin tol Brer Rabbit off, suh;\n    Brer Buzzard say, \"I'm a-gittin' ol', suh,\n      But I'll try my han,\" an' den he cough, suh.\n            An' de rest un um bowed dere thanks.\n\n    Now, ol' Brer B'ar wuz a-settin' in de cheer, suh,\n      So he stand up an' move a motion;\n    He up an' 'low, \"Le's erso'v right here, suh,\n      Fer ter thank Brer Buzzard whiles we're in de notion,\n            An' not put it off ter some yuther day.\"\n\n    An' den dey had it up an' down, suh,\n      'Sputin' 'bout what dey oughter do,\n    Some wanter gi' 'im a flower crown, suh,\n      Ef he rid Brer Rabbit up dar in de blue,\n            An' drap 'im when he got half-way.\n\n    Dey sont a runner atter ol' Brer Rabbit\n      Ter ax 'im ter call an' 'ten' de convention;\n    But ol' frien' Wobble-nose had a quare habit\n      Er knowin' a thing befo' it wuz mention',\n            An he come 'fo' he got de word.\n\n    He wiggle his nose, an' wunk his eye--\n      \"Here sho is de man I wants ter see, suh!\n    Brer Buzzard I'm tryin' ter l'arn how ter fly!\"\n      An' c'ose Brer Buzzard gi' his agree, suh,\n            An' all un um say he's a 'commydatin' bird!\n\n    An' den Brer Buzzard half spread his wing, suh\n      He try ter look young, but he wuz ol' suh--\n    He try ter strut an' walk wid a swing, suh;\n      He wuz dreamin' 'bout dat pot er gol', suh,\n            An' what he wuz gwine fer ter buy.\n\n    Brer Buzzard ain't skacely got thoo wid his pride, suh,\n      'Fo' Brer Rabbit lit right 'tween his floppers,\n    Wid, \"Now, hump yo'se'f, an' gi' me a ride, suh,\n      Ef you don't I'll hit--I'll hit you some whoppers\n            When I git you up dar in de sky!\"\n\n    Well, de creeturs grinned when Brer Buzzard riz, suh.\n      An' made a big fuss accordin' ter der natur';\n    Ez fer ol' Brer Rabbit, de pleasure wuz all his, suh\n      De ridin' wuz easy ez eatin' tater\n            When it's b'iled an' made inter pie!\n\n    Kaze under bofe wings he had a paw, suh,\n      An', when Brer Buzzard try fer ter drap 'im.\n    He'd scratch an' tickle 'im wid his claw, suh;\n      An' when Brer Buzzard try fer ter flap 'im,\n            He'd scratch an' wink his eye!\n\n    An' wid his claws he tuck an' steered 'im\n      Fum post ter pillar in de deep blue, suh;\n    He'd holla an' laugh--all de creeturs heer'd 'im--\n      You know how you'd feel ef it hab been you, suh,\n            A-waitin' fer some un ter fall!\n\n    When ol' Brer Rabbit got tired er ridin',\n      He steered Brer Buzzard right straight ter de groun', suh,\n    An' den an' dar went right inter hidin'.\n      When de creeturs come up he couldn't be foun', suh,\n            An' I speck an' I reckon dat's all!\n\n\n\n\nBRER RABBIT AND THE GOLD MINE\n\nThere had been silence in the cabin for a long ten minutes, and Uncle\nRemus, looking up, saw a threat of sleep in the little boy's eyes.\nWhereupon he plunged headlong into a story without a word of\nexplanation.\n\n\"Well, suh, one year it fell out dat de craps wuz burnt up. A dry drouth\nhad done de work, an' ef you'd 'a' struck a match anywhar in dat\nsettlement, de whole county would 'a' blazed up. Ol' man Hongriness des\nnatchally tuck of his cloze an' went paradin' 'bout eve'ywhar, an' de\ncreeturs got bony an' skinny. Ol' Brer B'ar done better dan any un um,\nkaze all he hatter do wuz go ter sleep an' live off'n his own fat; an'\nBrer Rabbit an' his ol' 'oman had put some calamus root by, an' saved up\nsome sugar-cane dat dey fin' lyin' 'roun' loose, an' _dey_ got 'long\npurty well. But de balance er de creeturs wuz dat ga'nt dat dey ain't\ngot over it down ter dis day.\n\n\"De creeturs had der meetin'-place, whar dey could all set 'roun' an'\ntalk de kind er politics dey had, des like folks does at de cross-roads\ngrocery. One day, whiles dey wuz all settin' an' squottin' 'roun',\njowerin' an' confabbin', Brer Rabbit, he up 'n' say, sezee, dat ol'\nMammy-Bammy-Big-Money tol' his great gran'daddy dat dar wuz a mighty big\nan' fat gol' mine in deze parts, an' he say dat he wouldn't be 'tall\n'stonished ef 'twant some'rs close ter Brer B'ar's house. Brer B'ar, he\ngrowled, he did, an' say dat de gol' mine better not let him fin' it,\nkaze atter he got done wid it, dey won't be no gol' mine dar.\n\n\"Some laughed, some grinned an' some gapped, an', atter jowerin' some\nmo', dey all put out ter whar der famblies wuz livin' at; but I boun'\nyou dey ain't fergit 'bout dat gol' mine, kaze, fum dat time on, go whar\nyou mought, you'd ketch some er de creeturs diggin' an' grabblin' in de\ngroun', some in de fields, some in de woods, an' some in de big road;\nan' dey wuz so weak an' hongry dat dey kin skacely grabble fer fallin'\ndown.\n\n\"Well, dis went on fer de longest, but bimeby, one day, dey all 'gree\ndat sump'n bleeze ter be done, an' dey say dey'll all take one big hunt\nfer de gol' mine, an' den quit. Dey hunted in gangs, wid de gangs not\nfur fum one an'er, an' it so happen dat Brer Rabbit wuz in de gang wid\nBrer Wolf, an' he know'd dat he hatter keep his eyes wide open. All de\ncreeturs hatter dig in diffunt places, an' whiles Brer Rabbit want much\nuv a grabbler, he had a way er makin' de yuthers b'lieve dat he wuz de\nbest er de lot. So he made a heap er motion like he wuz t'arin' up de\nyeth. Dey ain't been gwine on dis away long fo' Brer Wolf holler out,\n\n\"'Run here, Brer Rabbit! I done foun' it!' Brer B'ar an' Brer Fox wuz\nbofe diggin' close by, an' Brer Rabbit kinder wunk one eye at de\nelements; he say, sezee, 'Glad I is fer yo' sake, Brer Wolf; git yo'\ngol' an' 'joy yo'se'f!' Brer Wolf say, 'Come git some, Brer Rabbit! Come\ngit some!' Ol' Brer Rabbit 'spon', 'I'll take de leavin's, Brer Wolf;\nyou take what you want, an' den when you done got 'nough I'll get de\nleetle bit I want.' Brer Wolf say, 'I wanter show you sump'n.' Brer\nRabbit 'low, 'My eyes ain't big fer nothin'.' Brer Wolf say, 'I got a\nsecret I wanter tell you.' Brer Rabbit 'low, 'My y'ears ain't long fer\nnothin'. Des stan' dar an' do yo' whisperin', Brer Wolf, an' I'll hear\neve'y word you say.'\n\n\"Brer Wolf ain't say nothin', but make out he's grabblin', an' den, all\nof a sudden, he made a dash at Brer Rabbit, but when he git whar Brer\nRabbit wuz at, Brer Rabbit ain't dar no mo'; he done gone.

LION LOST HIS WOOL\n\n\"Twuz des sech a day ez dis dat Mr Lion lost his wool,\" remarked Uncle\nRemus to the little boy, \"Mr. Man tuck a notion dat de time done come\nfer him fer ter have a hog-killin' an' he got 'im a big barrel, an' fill\nit half full er water fum de big springs. Den he piled up 'bout a cord\ner wood, an' ez he piled, he put rocks 'twix' de logs, an' den he sot de\nwood after at bofe een's an' in de middle. 'Twan't long 'fo' dey had de\nhogs killt, an' eve'ything ready fer ter scrape de ha'r off. Den he tuck\nde red-hot rocks what he put in de fire, an' flung um in de barrel whar\nde water wuz, an' 'twan't long, mon, 'fo' dat water wuz ready fer ter\nbile. Den dey tuck de hogs, one at a time, an' soused um in de water,\nan' time dey tuck um out, he ha'r wuz ready fer ter drap out by de\nroots. Den dey'd scrape un wid sticks an' chips, an' dey aint leave a\nha'r on um.\n\n\"Well, bimeby, dey had all de hogs killt an' cleaned, an' hauled off,\nan' when eve'ything wuz still ez a settin' hen, ol' Brer Rabbit stuck\nhis head out fum behine a bush whar he been settin' at. He stuck his\nhead out, he did, an' look all 'roun', an' den he went whar de fier wuz\nan' try fer ter warm hisse'f. He aint been dar long 'fo' here come Brer\nWolf an' Brer Fox, an den he got busy.\n\n\"He say, 'Hello, frien's! howdy an' welcome! I 'm des fixin' fer ter\ntake a warm baff like Mr. Man gi' his hogs; wont you j'ine me?' Dey say\ndey aint in no hurry, but dey holp Brer Rabbit put de hot rocks in de\nbarrel an' dey watch de water bubble, an' bimeby, when eve'ything wuz\nready, who should walk up but ol' Mr. Lion?\n\n\"He had a mane fum his head plum ter de een' er his tail, an' in some\nplaces it wuz so long it drug on de groun'--dat what make all de\ncreeturs 'fear'd un 'im. He growl an' ax um what dey doin', an' when\nBrer Rabbit tell 'im, he say dat's what he long been needin'. 'How does\nyou git in?' 'Des back right in,' sez ol' Brer Rabbit, sezee, an' wid\ndat,\n\n\"Mr. Lion backed in, an' de water wuz so hot, he try fer ter git out,\nan' he slipped in plum ter his shoulder-blades. You kin b'lieve me er\nnot, but dat creetur wuz scall'd so dat he holler'd an' skeer'd\neve'ybody fur miles aroun'.\n\n\"An when he come out, all de wool drap't out, 'cep' de bunch you see on\nhis neck, an' de leetle bit you'll fin' on de een' er his tail--an'\ndat'd 'a' come off ef de tail hadn't 'a' slipped thoo de bung-hole er de\nbarrel.\" With that, Uncle Remus closed his eyes, but not so tightly that\nhe couldn't watch the little boy. For a moment the child said nothing,\nand then, \"I must tell that tale to mother before I forget it!\" So\nsaying, he ran out of the cabin as fast as his feet could carry him,\nleaving Uncle Remus shaking with laughter.\n\n\n\n\nHOW BRER RABBIT GOT A HOUSE\n\n    Oh, once 'pon a time, all de creeturs, all de creeturs,\n        Tuck a notion dat dey'd build a house,\n    An' fix it so ez ter keep out de skeeters,\n        An' fix it up nix cummy rous!\n    Dey all wuz dar fum de B'ar ter de Possum,\n        Brer Wolf, Brer Fox, Brer Coon,\n    Wid ol' Brer Rabbit fer ter stan' 'roun' an' boss um,\n        Kaze dey hatter have de' house right soon.\n\n    Brer Rabbit, he wuz busy, oh, yes, mighty busy,\n        Not doin' uv a blessed thing;\n    Ef he clim' de scaffle, he say he'll git dizzy,\n        So he medjur an' mark an' sing.\n    Dey buil' de house, an' it sho wuz a fine un,\n        Made er poplar, oak an' pine;\n    De littlest room wuz a sev'm-by-nine un,\n        Whar de sick could go an' whine!\n\n    Brer Rabbit, he wait, an' when de time come\n        He choosened a upsta's room,\n    An' dar he sot (ef I kin make de rhyme come)\n        A-singin' \"Hark fum de Toom\"!\n    An' den he got what he aint had oughter,\n        Ez all de creeturs said,\n    A gun, a cannon, an' a tub er water,\n        An' hid um under his bed!\n\n    When de creeturs come home, Brer Rabbit wuz ready,\n        An' he tell um he gwineter set down;\n    \"Well, set,\" sez dey, \"an' we'll try ter be ste'dy,\"\n        An' wid dat, Brer Rabbit kinder frown;\n    Bang-bang! went de gun--de barrels wuz double--\n        An' de creeturs wuz still ez mice;\n    Brer B'ar he say, \"Dy must be some trouble,\n      But I hope heedon't loosen de j'is!\"\n\n    Brer Rabbit, he say, \"Wharbouts mus' I spit at?\"\n        An' Brer Wolf answer, wid a grin,\n    \"Des wharsomever you kin make it hit at!\"\n        Brer Fox, he rub his chin;\n    Brer Rabbit, he tuck de tub er water,\n        An' empty it all on de sta'rs,\n    An' it come nigh drownin' Brer Coon's daughter.\n        An' likewise one er Brer B'ar's!\n\n    Brer Rabbit say, \"When I sneeze I'll skeer you,\n        An' I hate fer ter have it ter do!\"\n    Brer Fox say, \"We'll lissen an' hear you\n        Des go right ahead wid yo' sneeze-a-ma-roo!\"\n    Boom-a-lam! went de cannon, an' de creeturs, dey lit out\n        Thoo window-sash an' do'\n    Any way, any way dat dey kin git oot,\n        An' dey aint come dar no mo'!\n\n\n\n\nBRER RABBIT AND THE PARTRIDGE NEST\n\n    Oh, what's de matter wid de Whipperwill,\n    Dat she sets an' cries on de furder hill?\n    An' what's de matter wid Miss Bob White,\n    Dat she choke herse'f wid sayin' Good-night?\n    You know mighty well dat sump'n is wrong\n    When dey sets an' sings dat kinder song,\n    'Twix' a call an' a cry, 'twix' a weep an' a wail--\n    Dey must be tellin' a mighty sad tale.\n\n    Miss Whipperwill's troubles, an' what she say\n    Will do fer ter tell some yuther day;\n    But Miss Bob White--my! aint she a sight?--\n    I'll hatter tell why she hollers Good-night.\n    Dey once wuz a time (needer mo' ner less)\n    When she ain't try ter hide ner kivver her nes';\n    She built it in de open, whar all kin see,\n    An' wuz des ez perlite ez she kin be.\n\n    She'd make her house facin' eas' an' wes',\n    An' den wid eggs she'd fill her nes';\n    Fer ter keep um warm she'd brood an' set,\n    An' keep her house fum gittin' wet.\n    Whiles dis gwine on, Brer Rabbit come by,\n    A-wigglin' his mouf, an' a-blinkin' his eye:\n    \"De top er de mornin', Miss Bob,\" sezee;\n    \"De same ter you, Brer Rabbit,\" se' she.\n\n    Sez ol' Brer Rabbit, \"I been missin' you long,\n    I wuz mighty fear'd dat sump'n wuz wrong,\n    But here you set ez still ez a mouse,\n    Not doin' nothin' but keepin' house!\"\n    \"Oh, well,\" se' she, \"I'm too ol' ter gad,\n    I use' ter do it, but I wish I never had!\n    De only thing I want is ter wash my dress,\n    But I can't do dat whiles I'm on my nes'.\"\n\n    Brer Rabbit, he say, \"Can't I he'p you out?\n    I ain't doin' nothin' but walkin' about,\n    An' my ol' 'oman is willin' fer ter bet\n    Dat ef settin 's de thing, I'm ol' man Set!\"\n    \"I know mighty well,\" sez Miss Bob White,\n    \"Ef you set a-tall, it'll be done right.\"\n    \"Thanky-do, Miss Bob!
