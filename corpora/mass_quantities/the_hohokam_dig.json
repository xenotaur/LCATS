    "body": "At first the two scientists thought the Indian attack on them was a joke\nperpetrated by some of their friends. After all, modern Indians did not\nattack white men any more.\n\nExcept that these did.\n\nGeorge Arthbut and Sidney Hunt were both out of New York, on the staff\nof the Natural History Museum. George was an ethnologist who specialized\nin what could be reconstructed about the prehistoric Indians of North\nAmerica, with emphasis on those of the Southwest. He was a tall, lean,\ngracious bald man in his early sixties.\n\nSidney was an archeologist who was fascinated by the ruins of the same\nkind of ancient Indians. Medium-sized, with black hair that belied his\nsixty-five years, he and George made an excellent team, being the\nleaders in their field.\n\nThey had come west on a particular bit of business this spring, trying\nto solve the largest question that remained about the old cliff dwellers\nand the prehistoric desert Indians, both of whom had deserted their\nvillages and gone elsewhere for reasons that remained a mystery.\n\nOne theory was that drought had driven them both away. Another theory\nran to the effect that enemies wiped them out or made off with them as\ncaptives. Still another supposition, at least for the Hohokam desert\npeople, the builders of Casa Grande whose impressive ruins still stood\nnear Coolidge, had to do with their land giving out so they could no\nlonger grow crops, forcing them to go elsewhere to find better soil.\n\nNo one really knew. It was all pure guesswork.\n\n\n\nThe two scientists meant to spend the entire summer trying to solve this\nriddle for all time, concentrating on it to the exclusion of everything\nelse. They drove west in a station wagon stuffed with equipment and\ntracking a U-Haul-It packed with more.\n\nGeorge drove, on a road that was only two sand tracks across the wild\nempty desert between Casa Grande Monument and Tonto National Monument\nwhere cliff dwellers had lived. It was here, not far ahead, in new ruins\nthat were being excavated, that they hoped to solve the secret of the\nexodus of the prehistoric Indians. The place was known as the Hohokam\nDig.\n\nThey topped a rise of ground and came to the site of the dig. Here the\nsand tracks ended right in the middle of long trenches dug out to reveal\nthick adobe walls. In the partially bared ruins the outline of a small\nvillage could be seen; the detailed excavation would be done this summer\nby workmen who would arrive from Phoenix and Tucson.\n\nGeorge stopped their caravan and the two men got out, stretching their\nlegs. They looked about, both more interested in the dig, now they were\nback at it, than setting up camp. They walked around, examining various\nparts of it, and the excitement of the promise of things to be\ndiscovered in the earth came to them. \"This summer we'll learn the\nanswer,\" Sidney predicted.\n\nWith skeptical hope George replied, \"Maybe.\"\n\nIt was early afternoon when they set up camp, getting out their tent\nfrom the U-Haul-It. They took out most of their gear, even setting up a\nportable TV set run on batteries brought along. They worked efficiently\nand rapidly, having done this many times before and having their\nequipment well organized from long experience. By the middle of the\nafternoon all was ready and they rested, sitting on folding chairs at a\nsmall table just outside the opening of their tent.\n\nLooking around at the dig Sidney remarked, \"Wouldn't it be easy if we\ncould talk to some of the people who once lived here?\"\n\n\"There's a few questions I'd like to ask them,\" said George. \"I\ncertainly wish we had some to talk with.\"\n\nHe had no more than uttered this casual wish than there sounded, from\nall sides of where they sat, screeching whoops. The naked brown men who\nsuddenly appeared seemed to materialize from right out of the\nexcavations. As they yelled they raised their weapons. The air was\nfilled, for an instant, with what looked like long arrows. Most of them\nwhistled harmlessly past the two scientists, but one hit the side of the\nstation wagon, making a resounding thump and leaving a deep dent, while\ntwo buried themselves in the wood of the U-Haul-It and remained there,\nquivering.\n\nGeorge and Sidney, after the shock of their first surprise at this\nattack, leaped to their feet.\n\n\"The car!\" cried Sidney. \"Let's get out of here!\"\n\nThey both started to move. Then George stopped and grabbed Sidney's arm.\n\"Wait!\"\n\n\"Wait?\" Sidney demanded. \"They'll kill us!\"\n\n\"Look,\" advised George, indicating the red men who surrounded them; they\nnow made no further move of attack.\n\nGeorge gazed about. \"Oh,\" he said, \"you think somebody's playing a joke\non us?\"\n\n\"Could be,\" said George. He ran one hand over his bald head.\n\n\"Some dear friends,\" Sidney went on, resenting the scare that had been\nthrown into them, \"hired some Indians to pretend to attack us?\"\n\n\"Maybe Pimas,\" said George. He peered at the Indians, who now were\njabbering among themselves and making lamenting sounds as they glanced\nabout at the ruins of the ancient village. There were eighteen of them.\nThey were clad in nothing more than a curious cloth of some kind run\nbetween their legs and up and over a cord about their waists, to form a\nshort apron, front and back.\n\n\"Or Zunis,\" said Sidney.\n\n\"Maybe Maricopas,\" said George.\n\n\"Except,\" Sidney observed, \"none of them look like those kind of\nIndians. And those arrows they shot.\" He stared at the two sticking in\nthe U-Haul-It. \"Those aren't arrows, George--they're atlatl lances!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said George.\n\nSidney breathed, \"They aren't holding bows--they've got atlatls!\"\n\n\"No modern Indian of any kind,\" said George, \"uses an atlatl.\"\n\n\"Most of them wouldn't even know what it was,\" Sidney agreed. \"They\nhaven't been used for hundreds of years; the only place you see them is\nin museums.\"\n\nAn atlatl was the weapon which had replaced the stone axe in the stone\nage. It was a throwing stick consisting of two parts. One was the lance,\na feathered shaft up to four feet long, tipped with a stone point. The\ntwo-foot flat stick that went with this had a slot in one end and two\nrawhide finger loops. The lance end was fitted in the slot to be thrown.\nThe stick was an extension of the human arm to give the lance greater\nforce. Some atlatls had small charm stones attached to them to give\nthem extra weight and magic.\n\nCharm stones could be seen fastened to a few of the atlatls being held\nby the Indians now standing like bronze statues regarding them.\n\nGeorge whispered, \"What do you make of it?\"\n\n\"It isn't any joke,\" replied Sidney. He gazed tensely at the Indians.\n\"That's all I'm sure of.\"\n\n\"Have you noticed their breechclouts?\"\n\nSidney stared again. \"They aren't modern clouts. George, they're right\nout of Hohokam culture!\"\n\n\"They aren't made of cloth, either. That's plaited yucca fibre.\"\n\n\"Just like we've dug up many times. Only here ...\" George faltered.\n\"It's being worn by--by I don't know what.\"\n\n\"Look at their ornaments.\"\n\nNecklaces, made of pierced colored stones, hung about many of the brown\nnecks. Shell bracelets were to be seen, and here and there a carved\npiece of turquoise appeared.\n\n\"Look at the Indian over there,\" George urged.\n\nSidney looked to the side where George indicated, and croaked, \"It's a\ngirl!\"\n\nIt was a girl indeed. She stood straight and magnificent in body\ncompletely bare except for the brief apron at her loins. Between her\nbeautiful full copper breasts there hung a gleaming piece of turquoise\ncarved in the shape of a coyote.\n\nAt her side stood a tall young Indian with a handsome face set with\ngreat pride. On her other side was a wizened little old fellow with a\nwrinkled face and ribs corrugated like a saguaro.\n\nSidney turned back and demanded, \"What do you make of this? Are we\nseeing things?\" Hopefully, he suggested, \"A mirage or sort of a mutual\nhallucination?\"\n\nIn a considered, gauging tone George replied, \"They're real.\"\n\n\"Real?\" cried Sidney. \"What do you mean, real?\"\n\n\"Real in a way. I mean, Sidney, these--I sound crazy to myself saying\nit--but I think these are--well, Sid, maybe they're actual prehistoric\nIndians.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Well, let's put it this way: We asked for them and we got them.\"\n\nSidney stared, shocked at George's statement. \"You're crazy, all right,\"\nhe said. \"Hohokams in the middle of the Twentieth Century?\"\n\n\"I didn't say they're Hohokams, though they probably are, of the village\nhere.\"\n\n\"You said they're prehistoric,\" Sidney accused. He quavered, \"Just how\ncould they be?\"\n\n\"Sid, you remember in our Indian studies, again and again, we meet the\nmedicine man who has visions. Even modern ones have done things that are\npretty impossible to explain. I believe they have spiritual powers\nbeyond the capability of the white man. The prehistoric medicine men may\nhave developed this power even more. I think the old man there is their\nmedicine man.\"\n\n\"So?\" Sidney invited.\n\n\"I'm just supposing now, mind you,\" George went on. He rubbed his bald\npate again as though afraid of what thoughts were taking place under it.\n\"Maybe way back--a good many hundreds of years ago--this medicine man\ndecided to have a vision of the future. And it worked. And here he is\nnow with some of his people.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Sidney objected. \"So he had this vision and transported\nthese people to this moment in time. But if it was hundreds of years ago\nthey're already dead, been dead for a long time, so how could they--\"\n\n\"Don't you see, Sid? They can be dead, but their appearance in the\nfuture--for them--couldn't occur until now because it's happened with us\nand we weren't living and didn't come along here at the right time until\nthis minute.\"\n\nSidney swallowed. \"Maybe,\" he muttered, \"maybe.\"\n\n\"Another thing,\" George said. \"If we can talk with them we can learn\neverything we've tried to know in all our work and solve in a minute\nwhat we're ready to spend the whole summer, even years, digging for.\"\n\nSidney brightened. \"That's what we wanted to do.\"\n\nGeorge studied the Indians again. \"I think they're just as surprised as\nwe are. When they discovered themselves here and saw us--and you must\nremember we're the first white men they've ever seen--their immediate\ninstinct was to attack. Now that we don't fight back they're waiting for\nus to make a move.\"\n\n\"What do we do?\"\n\n\"Take it easy,\" advised George. \"Don't look scared and don't look\nbelligerent. Look friendly and hope some of the modern Indian dialects\nwe know can make connection with them.\"\n\n\n\nThe two scientists began, at a gradual pace, to make their way toward\nthe old man, the young man, and the girl. As they approached, the girl\ndrew back slightly. The young man reached over his shoulder and from the\nfurred quiver slung on his back drew an atlatl lance and fitted it to\nhis throwing stick, holding it ready. The other warriors, all about,\nfollowed suit.\n\nThe medicine man alone stepped forward. He held up a short colored stick\nto which bright feathers were attached and shook it at the two white\nmen. They stopped.\n\n\"That's his aspergill,\" observed Sidney. \"I'd like to have that one.\"\n\nThe medicine man spoke. At first the scientists were puzzled, then\nGeorge told Sidney, \"That's Pima, or pretty close to it, just pronounced\ndifferently. It probably shows we were right in thinking the Pimas\ndescended from these people. He wants to know who we are.\"\n\nGeorge gave their names. The medicine man replied, \"The man who has\nwhite skin instead of red speaks our language in a strange way. I am\nHuk.\" He turned to the young man at his side and said, \"This is Good\nFox, our young chief.\" He indicated the girl. \"That is Moon Water, his\nwife.\"\n\nGeorge explained what he and the other white man with him were doing\nhere. Huk, along with all the other Indians, including Good Fox and Moon\nWater, listened intently; they seemed greatly excited and disturbed.\n\nWhen George was finished Good Fox turned to Huk and said, \"You have\nsucceeded, wise one, in bringing us forward, far in the future to the\ntime of these men with white skins.\"\n\n\"This is the truth,\" said the wrinkled Huk; he did not boast but rather\nseemed awed.\n\nMoon Water spoke in a frightened tone. She looked about at the partially\nexcavated ruins and asked, \"But what has happened to our village?\" She\nfaltered, \"Is this the way it will look in the future?\"\n\n\"It is the way,\" Good Fox informed her sorrowfully.\n\n\"I weep for our people,\" she said. \"I do not want to see it.\" She hung\nher pretty face over her bare body, then, in a moment, raised it\nresolutely.\n\nGood Fox shook the long scraggly black hair away from his eyes and told\nthe white men, \"We did not mean to harm you. We did not know what else\nto do upon finding you here and our village buried.\"\n\nIgnoring that in his excited interest, Sidney asked, \"What year are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Year?\" asked Good Fox. \"What is this word?\"\n\nBoth Sidney and George tried to get over to him what year meant in\nregard to a date in history, but Good Fox, Huk, and Moon Water, and none\nof the others could understand.\n\n\"We do not know what you mean,\" Huk said. \"We know only that we live\nhere in this village--not as you see it now--but one well built and\nalive with our people. As the medicine man I am known to have extra\npower and magic in visions. Often I have wondered what life would be\nlike in the far future. With this group I conjured up a vision of it,\ncarrying them and myself to what is now here before us.\"\n\nGeorge and Sidney glanced at each other. George's lips twitched and\nthose of Sidney trembled. George said softly to the Indians, \"Let us be\nfriends.\" He explained to them what they were doing here. \"We are trying\nto find out what you were--are--like. Especially what made you desert\npeople leave your villages.\"\n\nThey looked blank. Huk said, \"But we have not left--except in this\nvision.\"\n\nIn an aside to George, Sidney said, \"That means we've caught them before\nthey went south or wherever they went.\" He turned back to Huk. \"Have\nthe cliff people yet deserted their dwellings?\"\n\nHuk nodded solemnly. \"They have gone. Some of them have joined us here,\nand more have gone to other villages.\"\n\n\"We have read that into the remains of your people, especially at Casa\nGrande,\" Sidney told him. With rising excitement in his voice he asked,\n\"Can you tell us why they left?\"\n\nHuk nodded. \"This I can do.\"\n\nNow the glance of Sidney and George at each other was quick, their eyes\nlighting.\n\n\"I'll take it down on the typewriter,\" Sidney said. \"Think of it! Now\nwe'll know.\"\n\nHe led Huk to the table set in front of the tent, where he brought out a\nportable typewriter and opened and set it up. He sat on one chair, and\nHuk, gingerly holding his aspergill before him as though to protect\nhimself, sat on the other.\n\nGood Fox, Moon Water and the other Indians crowded about, curious to see\nthe machine that came alive under Sidney's fingers as Huk began to\nrelate his story. Soon their interest wandered in favor of other things\nabout the two men with white skin. They wanted to know about the machine\nwith four legs.\n\nGeorge opened up the hood of the station wagon and showed them the\nengine. He sat in the car and started the motor. At the noise the\nIndians jumped back, alarmed, and reaching for their atlatls. Moon Water\napproached the rear end of the car. Her pretty nose wrinkled at the\nfumes coming from it and she choked, drawing back in disgust. \"It is\ntrying to kill me,\" she said.\n\nClearly, she did not approve of an automobile.\n\nGeorge cut off its engine.\n\nOver Good Fox's shoulder hung a small clay water jug hung in a plaited\nyucca net. George asked for a drink from it and when he tasted it and\nfound it fresh it was wondrous to him that its water was hundreds of\nyears old. He brought out a thermos, showing the Indians the modern\nversion of carrying water. They tasted of its contents and exclaimed at\nits coolness. Good Fox held the thermos, admiring it.\n\n\"Would you like to have it?\" asked George.\n\n\"You would give it to me?\" the handsome young Indian asked.\n\n\"It's yours.\"\n\n\"Then I give you mine.\" He gave George his clay water jug and could not\nknow how much more valuable it was than the thermos.\n\nGeorge then took them to the portable television set and turned it on.\nWhen faces, music, and words appeared the Indians jerked back, then\njabbered and gathered closer to watch. A girl singer, clad in a gown\nthat came up to her neck, caused Moon Water to inquire, \"Why does she\nhide herself? Is she ashamed?\"\n\nThe standards of modesty, George reflected as he glanced at the lovely\nnude form of the prehistoric Indian girl, change with the ages.\n\nOf the people and noises on the TV screen Good Fox wanted to know quite\nsolemnly, \"Are these crazy people? Is it the way you treat your people\nwho go crazy?\"\n\nGeorge laughed. \"You might say it's something like that.\"\n\nA shout came from Sidney at the card table near the tent where he was\ntaking down Huk's story. \"George! He's just told me why the cliff people\nleft! And why the desert people will have to leave in time. It's a\nreason we never thought of! It's because--\"\n\nJust then a big multi-engined plane came over, drowning out his words.\nThe Indians stared skyward, now in great alarm. They looked about for a\nplace to run and hide, but there was none. They held their hands over\ntheir ears and glanced fearfully at the TV which now spluttered, its\npicture and sound thrown off by the plane. Awesomely, they waited until\nthe plane went over.\n\n\"We fly now in machines with wings,\" George explained.\n\n\"To make such a noise in the air,\" Moon Water said, \"is wicked,\ndestroying all peace.\"\n\n\"I'll agree with you there,\" said George.\n\n\"You have this,\" Good Fox observed, indicating the TV, which was now\nback to normal, \"and you send the other through the sky to make it\ncrazier than before.\" He shook his head, not comprehending.\n\nGeorge shut off the TV. He took up a camera of the kind that\nautomatically finishes a picture in a minute's time. Grouping Good Fox,\nMoon Water and the other warriors, he took their picture, waited, then\npulled it out and showed it to them.\n\nThey cried out, one man shouting in fear, \"It is great magic!\"\n\nGeorge took a number of photographs, including several of Huk as he sat\ntalking with Sidney. No matter what happened he would have this record\nas Sidney would have that he was taking down on the typewriter.\n\nNext he showed them a pair of binoculars, teaching them how to look\nthrough them. They exclaimed and Good Fox said, \"With this we could see\nour enemies before they see us.\"\n\n\"You have enemies?\" George asked.\n\n\"The Apache,\" Good Fox said fiercely.\n\nGeorge handed him the binoculars. \"It is yours to use against the\nApache.\"\n\nSolemnly the young chief answered, \"The man with white skin is thanked.\nThe red man gives in return his atlatl and lances.\" He held out his\nthrowing stick and unslung his quiver of lances. George accepted them\nwith thanks; they would be museum pieces.\n\nFinally George showed them a rifle. He looked about for game and after\nsome searching saw a rabbit sitting on a mound in the excavations. As\nhe took aim Good Fox asked, \"You would hunt it with your stick?\"\n\nGeorge nodded.\n\n\"This cannot be done from here,\" stated one warrior.\n\nGeorge squeezed the trigger. Instantaneously with the explosion of the\nshell the rabbit jumped high and then came down, limp and dead. The\nIndians yelled with fright and ran off in all directions. Huk jumped up\nfrom the table. Then all stopped and cautiously returned. One went to\nthe rabbit and picked it up, bringing it back. All, including Huk who\nleft the table, stared with fright at it and at the rifle.\n\nMoon Water expressed their opinion of it. \"The thunder of the killing\nstick is evil.\"\n\n\"Moon Water speaks the truth,\" said Huk.\n\n\"It would make hunting easy,\" said Good Fox, \"but we do not want it even\nif given to us.\"\n\nHe drew back from the rifle, and the others edged away from it.\n\nGeorge put it down.\n\nSidney held up a sheaf of papers. \"I've got it all, George,\" he said\nexultantly in English, \"right here! I asked Huk if they can stay with us\nin our time, at least for a while. We can study them more, maybe even\ntake them back to show the world.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He didn't have a chance to reply when you shot the rifle.\"\n\nGeorge put it formally to the Indians, addressing Huk, Good Fox, Moon\nWater and the rest. \"You have seen something of the modern world. We\nwould like you to stay in it if it is your wish. I don't know how long\nyou could stay in Huk's vision, but if you can remain here permanently\nand not go back to your time and--well, not being alive there any\nmore--we hope you will consider this.\"\n\nHuk replied, \"It is possible that we could stay in your time, at least\nas long as my vision lasts, which might be for as long as I lived.\" He\nglanced at Good Fox.\n\nThe young chief in turn looked at Moon Water. Her gaze went to the\nstation wagon, to the TV, then up at the sky where the plane had\nappeared, at the rifle, the camera, the thermos, and all else of the\nwhite man. She seemed to weigh their values and disadvantages, looking\ndubious and doubtful.\n\nGood Fox announced, \"We will hold a council about it. As is our custom,\nall have words to say about such a thing.\"\n\nAbruptly he led his people away, into the excavations and over a slight\nrise of ground, behind which they disappeared.\n\nSidney murmured, \"I don't like that so much.\"\n\n\"They must do as they want.\" George led the way to the card table and\nthey sat there. On it rested Huk's aspergill.\n\n\"He gave it to me,\" Sidney explained.\n\nGeorge placed Good Fox's netted clay water jug and his atlatl and furred\nquiver of lances on the table, together with the pictures he had taken\nof the ancient Indians. They waited.\n\nSidney, glancing at the low hill behind which the Indians had gone,\nsaid, \"What they're doing is choosing between living in modern\ncivilization and remaining dead. What do you think they'll do?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said George. \"They didn't think so much of us.\"\n\n\"But they couldn't choose death and complete oblivion!\"\n\n\"We'll see.\"\n\nThey waited some more.\n\n\"At least,\" said Sidney, indicating the articles on the table, \"we'll\nhave these for evidence.\" He held up the sheaf of papers containing\nHuk's story. \"And this, giving the real reason the cliff dwellers left.\nI haven't told you what it was, George. It's so simple that--\"\n\nHe didn't complete his sentence, for just then Huk, Good Fox, Moon\nWater, and the other warriors made their choice. It was announced\ndramatically.\n\nThe water jug, the aspergill, and the atlatl and quiver of lances\ndisappeared from the table. In their places, suddenly, there were the\nthermos and the binoculars.\n\nSidney stared stupidly at them.\n\nGeorge said quietly, \"They've gone back.\"\n\n\"But they can't do this!\" George protested.\n\n\"They have.\"\n\nSidney's hand shook as he picked up the sheaf of papers holding Huk's\nstory. Indicating it and the photographs, he said, \"Well, they haven't\ntaken these away.\"\n\n\"Haven't they?\" asked George. He picked up some of the pictures. \"Look.\"\n\nSidney looked and saw that the pictures were now blank. His glance went\nquickly to the typewritten sheets of paper in his hands. He cried out\nand then shuffled them frantically.\n\nThey, too, were blank.\n\nSidney jumped up. \"I don't care!\" he exclaimed. \"He told me and I've got\nit here!\" He pointed to his head. \"I can remember it, anyway.\"\n\n\"Can you?\" asked George.\n\n\"Why, certainly I can,\" Sidney asserted confidently. \"The reason the\ncliff dwellers left, George, was that they ...\" Sidney stopped.\n\n\"What's the matter, Sid?\"\n\n\"Well, I--it--I guess it just slipped my mind for a second.\" His brow\npuckered. He looked acutely upset and mystified. \"Huk told me,\" he\nfaltered. \"Just a minute ago I was thinking of it when I started to tell\nyou. Now ... I can't remember.\"\n\n\"That's gone, too.\"\n\n\"I'll get it!\" Sidney declared. \"I've just forgotten it for a minute.\nI'll remember!\"\n\n\"No,\" said George, \"you won't.\"\n\nSidney looked around. \"There must be something left.\" He thought. \"The\natlatl lances they shot at us!\" He looked at the U-Haul-It. The lances\nno longer stuck in its side. Nor were those that had fallen to the\nground to be seen.\n\nSidney sat down again, heavily. \"We had it all,\" he moaned. \"Everything\nwe'd been working for. And now ...\"\n\n\"Now we'll have to dig for it again,\" said George. \"Do it the hard way.\nWe'll start tomorrow when the workmen come.\"\n\nSidney looked up. \"There's one thing!\" he cried. \"The dent in the car\nmade by the lance! It's still there, George! However everything else\nworked, that was forgotten. It's still there!\"\n\nGeorge glanced at the dent in the side panel of the station wagon. \"It's\nstill there,\" he agreed. \"But only to tell us this wasn't a dream. No\none else would believe it wasn't caused by a rock.\"\n\nGeorge groaned. He stared at the rise of ground behind which the Indians\nhad disappeared. \"Huk,\" he pleaded. \"Good Fox. Moon Water. The others.\nCome back, come back ...\"\n\nNo one appeared over the rise of ground as the cool desert night began\nto close in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
