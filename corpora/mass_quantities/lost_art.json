    "body": "Sargon of Akkad was holding court in all of his splendor in the\nMesopotamia area, which he thought to be the center of the Universe.\nThe stars to him were but holes in a black bowl which he called the\nsky. They were beautiful then, as they are now, but he thought that\nthey were put there for his edification only; for was he not the ruler\nof Akkadia?\n\nAfter Sargon of Akkad, there would come sixty centuries of climbing\nbefore men reached the stars and found not only that there had been men\nupon them, but that a civilization on Mars had reached its peak four\nthousand years before Christ and was now but a memory and a wealth of\npictographs that adorned the semipreserved Temples of Canalopsis.\n\nAnd sixty centuries after, the men of Terra wondered about the\nideographs and solved them sufficiently to piece together the wonders\nof the long-dead Martian Civilization.\n\nSargon of Akkad did not know that the stars that he beheld carried on\nthem wonders his mind would not, could not, accept.\n\nAltas, the Martian, smiled tolerantly at his son. The young man boasted\non until Altas said: \"So you have memorized the contents of my manual?\nGood, Than, for I am growing old and I would be pleased to have my\nson fill my shoes. Come into the workshop that I may pass upon your\nproficiency.\"\n\nAltas led Than to the laboratory that stood at the foot of the great\ntower of steel; Altas removed from a cabinet a replacement element from\nthe great beam above their heads, and said: \"Than, show me how to hook\nthis up!\"\n\nThan's eyes glowed. From other cabinets he took small auxiliary parts.\nFrom hooks upon the wall, Than took lengths of wire. Working with a\nbrilliant deftness that was his heritage as a Martian, Than spent an\nhour attaching the complicated circuits. After he was finished, Than\nstepped back and said: \"There--and believe it or not, this is the first\ntime you have permitted me to work with one of the beam elements.\"\n\n\"You have done well,\" said Altas with that same cryptic smile. \"But now\nwe shall see. The main question is: Does it work?\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Than in youthful pride. \"Is it not hooked up exactly\nas your manual says? It will work.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" repeated Altas. \"We shall see.\"\n\n\n\nBarney Carroll and James Baler cut through the thin air of Mars in a\ndriver-wing flier at a terrific rate of speed. It was the only kind\nof flier that would work on Mars with any degree of safety since it\ndepended upon the support of its drivers rather than the wing surface.\nThey were hitting it up at almost a thousand miles per hour on their\nway from Canalopsis to Lincoln Head; their trip would take an hour and\na half.\n\nAs they passed over the red sand of Mars, endlessly it seemed, a glint\nof metal caught Barney's eye, and he shouted.\n\n\"What's the matter, Barney?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"Roll her over and run back a mile or so,\" said Barney. \"I saw\nsomething down there that didn't belong in this desert.\"\n\nJim snapped the plane around in a sharp loop that nearly took their\nheads off, and they ran back along their course.\n\n\"Yop,\" called Barney, \"there she is!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"See that glint of shiny metal? That doesn't belong in this mess of\nerosion. Might be a crash.\"\n\n\"Hold tight,\" laughed Jim. \"We're going down.\"\n\nThey did. Jim's piloting had all of the aspects of a daredevil racing\npilot's, and Barney was used to it. Jim snapped the nose of the little\nflier down and they power-dived to within a few yards of the sand\nbefore he set the plane on its tail and skidded flatwise to kill speed.\nHe leveled off, and the flier came screaming in for a perfect landing\nnot many feet from the glinting object.\n\n\"This is no crash,\" said Baler. \"This looks like the remains of an\nair-lane beacon of some sort.\"\n\n\"Does it? Not like any I've ever seen. It reminds me more of some of\nthe gadgets they find here and there--the remnants of the Ancients.\nThey used to build junk like this.\"\n\n\"Hook up the sand-blower,\" suggested Jim Baler. \"We'll clear some of\nthis rubble away and see what she really looks like. Can't see much\nmore than what looks like a high-powered searchlight.\"\n\nBarney hauled equipment out of the flier and hitched it to a small\nmotor in the plane. The blower created a small storm for an hour or so,\nits blast directed by suit-clad Barney Carroll. Working with experience\ngained in uncovering the remains of a dozen dead and buried cities,\nBarney cleared the shifting sand from the remains of the tower.\n\nThe head was there, preserved by the dry sand. Thirty feet below the\nplatform, the slender tower was broken off. No delving could find the\nlower portion.\n\n\"This is quite a find,\" said Jim. \"Looks like some of the carvings\non the Temple of Science at Canalopsis--that little house on the top\nof the spire with the three-foot runway around it; then this dingbat\nperched on top of the roof. Never did figure out what it was for.\"\n\n\"We don't know whether the Martians' eyes responded as ours do,\"\nsuggested Barney. \"This might be a searchlight that puts out with\nMartian visible spectrum. If they saw with infrared, they wouldn't\nbe using Terran fluorescent lighting. If they saw with long heat\nfrequencies, they wouldn't waste power with even a tungsten filament\nlight, but would have invented something that cooked its most energy\nin the visible spectrum, just as we have in the last couple of hundred\nyears.\"\n\n\"That's just a guess, of course.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Barney. \"Here, I've got the door cracked. Let's be\nthe first people in this place for six thousand years Terran. Take it\neasy, this floor is at an angle of thirty degrees.\"\n\n\"I won't slide. G'wan in. I'm your shadow.\"\n\n\n\nThey entered the thirty-foot circular room and snapped on their\ntorches. There was a bench that ran almost around the entire room. It\nwas empty save for a few scraps of metal and a Martian book of several\nhundred metal pages.\n\n\"Nuts,\" said Barney, \"we would have to find a thing like this but\nempty. That's our luck. What's the book, Jim?\"\n\n\"Some sort of text, I'd say. Full of diagrams and what seems to be\nmathematics. Hard to tell, of course, but we've established the fact\nthat mathematics is universal, though the characters can not possibly\nbe.\"\n\n\"Any chance of deciphering it?\" asked Barney.\n\n\"Let's get back in the flier and try. I'm in no particular hurry.\"\n\n\"Nor am I. I don't care whether we get to Lincoln Head tonight or the\nmiddle of next week.\"\n\n\"Now let's see that volume of diagrams,\" he said as soon as they were\nestablished in the flier.\n\nJim passed the book over, and Barney opened the book to the first page.\n\"If we never find anything else,\" he said, \"this will make us famous.\nI am now holding the first complete volume of Martian literature that\nanyone has ever seen. The darned thing is absolutely complete, from\ncover to cover!\"\n\n\"That's a find,\" agreed Jim. \"Now go ahead and transliterate it--you're\nthe expert on Martian pictographs.\"\n\nFor an hour, Barney scanned the pages of the volume. He made copious\nnotes on sheets of paper which he inserted between the metal leaves\nof the book. At the end of that time, during which Jim Baler had been\ninspecting the searchlight-thing on the top of the little house, he\ncalled to his friend, and Jim entered the flier lugging the thing on\nhis shoulders.\n\n\"What'cha got?\" he grinned. \"I brought this along. Nothing else in that\nshack, so we're complete except for the remnants of some very badly\ncorroded cable that ran from this thing to a flapping end down where\nthe tower was broken.\"\n\nBarney smiled and blinked. It was strange to see this big man working\nstudiously over a book; Barney Carroll should have been leading a horde\nof Venusian engineers through the Palanortis country instead of delving\ninto the artifacts of a dead civilization.\n\n\"I think that this thing is a sort of engineer's handbook,\" he said.\n\"In the front there is a section devoted to mathematical tables. You\nknow, a table of logs to the base twelve which is because the Martians\nhad six fingers on each hand. There is what seems to be a table of\ndefinite integrals--at least if I were writing a handbook I'd place the\ntable of integrals at the last part of the math section. The geometry\nand trig is absolutely recognizable because of the designs. So is the\nsolid geom and the analyt for the same reason. The next section seems\nto be devoted to chemistry; the Martians used a hexagonal figure for\na benzene ring, too, and so that's established. From that we find the\nkey to the Periodic Chart of the Atoms which is run vertically instead\nof horizontally, but still unique. These guys were sharp, though; they\nseem to have hit upon the fact that isotopes are separate elements\nthough so close in grouping to one another that they exhibit the same\nproperties. Finding this will uncover a lot of mystery.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Baler, \"from a book of this kind we can decipher most\nanything. The keying on a volume of physical constants is perfect and\nalmost infinite in number. What do they use for Pi?\"\n\n\"Circle with a double dot inside.\"\n\n\"And Planck's Constant?\"\n\n\"Haven't hit that one yet. But we will. But to get back to the meat of\nthis thing, the third section deals with something strange. It seems to\nhave a bearing on this gadget from the top of the tower. I'd say that\nthe volume was a technical volume on the construction, maintenance, and\nrepair of the tower and its functions--whatever they are.\"\n\nBarney spread the volume out for Jim to see. \"That dingbat is some sort\nof electronic device. Or, perhaps subelectronic. Peel away that rusted\nside and we'll look inside.\"\n\nJim peeled a six-inch section from the side of the big metal tube, and\nthey inspected the insides. Barney looked thoughtful for a minute and\nthen flipped the pages of the book until he came to a diagram.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said exultantly, \"this is she. Look, Jim, they draw a\ncathode like this, and the grids are made with a series of fine\nparallel lines. Different, but more like the real grid than our symbol\nof a zig-zag line. The plate is a round circle instead of a square, but\nthat's so clearly defined that it comes out automatically. Here's your\nannular electrodes, and the ... call 'em deflection plates. I think we\ncan hook this do-boodle up as soon as we get to our place in Lincoln\nHead.\"\n\n\"Let's go then. Not only would I like to see this thing work, but I'd\ngive anything to know what it's for!\"\n\n\"You run the crate,\" said Barney, \"and I'll try to decipher this mess\ninto voltages for the electrode-supply and so on. Then we'll be in\nshape to go ahead and hook her up.\"\n\n\n\nThe trip to Lincoln Head took almost an hour. Barney and Jim landed in\ntheir landing yards and took the book and the searchlight-thing inside.\nThey went to their laboratory, and called for sandwiches and tea. Jim's\nsister brought in the food a little later and found them tinkering with\nthe big beam tube.\n\n\"What have you got this time?\" she groaned.\n\n\"Name it and it's yours,\" laughed Barney.\n\n\"A sort of gadget that we found on the Red Desert.\"\n\n\"What does it do?\" asked Christine Baler.\n\n\"Well,\" said Jim, \"it's a sort of a kind of a dingbat that does things.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" said Christine. \"A dololly that plings the inghams.\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\n\"You're well met, you two. Have your fun. But for Pete's sake don't\nforget to eat. Not that you will, I know you, but a girl has got\nto make some sort of attempt at admonishment. I'm going to the\nmoom-picher. I'll see you when I return.\"\n\n\"I'd say stick around,\" said Barney. \"But I don't think we'll have\nanything to show you for hours and hours. We'll have something by the\ntime you return.\"\n\nChristine left, and the men applied themselves to their problem. Barney\nhad done wonders in unraveling the unknown. Inductances, he found,\nwere spirals; resistance were dotted lines; capacitances were parallel\nsquares.\n\n\"What kind of stuff do we use for voltages?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"That's a long, hard trail,\" laughed Barney. \"Basing my calculations\non the fact that their standard voltage cell was the same as ours, we\napply the voltages as listed on my schematic here.\"\n\n\"Can you assume that their standard is the same as ours?\"\n\n\"Better,\" said Barney. \"The Terran Standard Cell--the well-known Weston\nCell--dishes out what we call 1.0183 volts at twenty degrees C. Since\nthe Martian description of their Standard Cell is essentially the same\nas the Terran, they are using the same thing. Only they use sense and\nsay that a volt is the unit of a standard cell, period. Calculating\ntheir figures on the numerical base of twelve is tricky, but I've done\nit.\"\n\n\"You're doing fine. How do you assume their standard is the same?\"\n\n\"Simple,\" said Barney in a cheerful tone. \"Thank God for their habit of\ndrawing pictures. Here we have the well-known H tube. The electrodes\nare signified by the symbols for the elements used. The Periodic Chart\nin the first section came in handy here. But look, master mind, this\ndinky should be evacuated, don't you think?\"\n\n\"If it's electronic or subelectronic, it should be. We can solder up\nthis breach here and apply the hyvac pump. Rig us up a power supply\nwhilst I repair the blowout.\"\n\n\"Where's the BFO?\"\n\n\"What do you want with that?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"The second anode takes about two hundred volts worth of eighty-four\ncycles,\" explained Barney. \"Has a sign that seems to signify 'In\nPhase,' but I'll be darned if I know with what. Y'know, Jim, this\ndingbat looks an awful lot like one of the drivers we use in our\nspaceships and driver-wing fliers.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" drawled Jim. \"About the same recognition as the difference\nbetween Edison's first electric light and a twelve-element, electron\nmultiplier, power output tube. Similarity: They both have cathodes.\"\n\n\"Edison didn't have a cathode--\"\n\n\"Sure he did. Just because he didn't hang a plate inside of the bottle\ndoesn't stop the filament from being a cathode.\"\n\nBarney snorted. \"A monode, hey?\"\n\n\"Precisely. After which come diodes, triodes, tetrodes, pentodes,\nhexodes, heptodes--\"\n\n\"--and the men in the white coats. How's your patching job?\"\n\n\"Fine. How's your power-supply job?\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" said Barney. \"This eighty-four cycles is not going to be\na sine wave at two hundred volts; the power stage of the BFO overloads\njust enough to bring in a bit of second harmonic.\"\n\n\"A beat-frequency-oscillator was never made to run at that level,\"\ncomplained Jim Baler. \"At least, not this one. She'll tick on a bit of\nsecond, I think.\"\n\n\"Are we ready for the great experiment?\"\n\n\"Yup, and I still wish I knew what the thing was for. Go ahead, Barney.\nCrack the big switch!\"\n\n\n\nAltas held up a restraining hand as Than grasped the main power switch.\n\"Wait,\" he said. \"Does one stand in his sky flier and leave the ground\nat full velocity? Or does one start an internal combustion engine at\nfull speed?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the youngster. \"We usually take it slowly.\"\n\n\"And like the others, we must tune our tube. And that we cannot do\nunder full power. Advance your power lever one-tenth step and we'll\nadjust the deflection anodes.\"\n\n\"I'll get the equipment,\" said Than. \"I forgot that part.\"\n\n\"Never mind the equipment,\" smiled Altas. \"Observe.\"\n\nAltas picked up a long screw-driverlike tool and inserted it into the\nmaze of wiring that surrounded the tube. Squinting in one end of the\nbig tube, he turned the tool until the cathode surface brightened\nslightly. He adjusted the instrument until the cathode was at its\nbrightest, and then withdrew the tool.\n\n\"That will do for your experimental set-up,\" smiled Altas. \"The\noperation in service is far more critical and requires equipment. As\nan experiment, conducted singly, the accumulative effect cannot be\ndangerous, though if the deflection plates are not properly served with\ntheir supply voltages, the experiment is a failure. The operation of\nthe tube depends upon the perfection of the deflection-plate voltages.\"\n\n\"No equipment is required, then?\"\n\n\"It should have been employed,\" said Altas modestly. \"But in my years\nas a beam-tower attendant, I have learned the art of aligning the\nplates by eye. Now, son, we may proceed from there.\"\n\n\n\nBarney Carroll took a deep breath and let the power switch fall home.\nCurrent meters swung across their scales for an instant, and then the\nlights went out in the house!\n\n\"Fuse blew,\" said Barney shortly. He gumbled his way through the dark\nhouse and replaced the fuse. He returned smiling. \"Fixed that one,\" he\ntold Jim. \"Put a washer behind it.\"\n\n\"O.K. Hit the switch again.\"\n\nBarney cranked the power over, and once more the meters climbed up\nacross the scales. There was a groaning sound from the tube, and the\nsmell of burning insulation filled the room. One meter blew with an\naudible sound as the needle hit the end stop, and immediately afterward\nthe lights in the entire block went out.\n\n\"Fix that one by hanging a penny behind it,\" said Jim with a grin.\n\n\"That's a job for Martian Electric to do,\" laughed Barney.\n\nSeveral blocks from there, an attendant in the substation found the\nopen circuit-breaker and shoved it in with a grim smile. He looked up\nat the power-demand meter and grunted. High for this district, but not\ndangerous. Duration, approximately fifteen seconds. Intensity, higher\nthan usual but not high enough to diagnose any failure of the wiring in\nthe district. \"Ah, well,\" he thought, \"we can crank up the blow-point\non this breaker if it happens again.\"\n\nHe turned to leave and the crashing of the breaker scared him out of\na week's growth. He snarled and said a few choice words not fit for\npublication. He closed the breaker and screwed the blow-point control\nup by two-to-one. \"That'll hold 'em,\" he thought, and then the ringing\nof the telephone called him to his office, and he knew that he was in\nfor an explanatory session with some people who wanted to know why\ntheir lights were going on and off. He composed a plausible tale on his\nway to the phone. Meanwhile, he wondered about the unreasonable demand\nand concluded that one of the folks had just purchased a new power saw\nor something for their home workshop.\n\n\"Crack the juice about a half,\" suggested Barney. \"That'll keep us on\nthe air until we find out what kind of stuff this thing takes. The book\nclaims about one tenth of the current-drain for this unit. Something\nwe've missed, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Let's see that circuit,\" said Jim. After a minute, he said: \"Look,\nguy, what are these screws for?\"\n\n\"They change the side plate voltages from about three hundred to about\nthree hundred and fifty. I've got 'em set in the middle of the range.\"\n\n\"Turn us on half voltage and diddle one of 'em.\"\n\n\"That much of a change shouldn't make the difference,\" objected Barney.\n\n\"Brother, we don't know what this thing is even for,\" reminded Jim.\n\"Much less do we know the effect of anything on it. Diddle, I say.\"\n\n\"O.K., we diddle.\" Barney turned on half power and reached into the\nmaze of wiring and began to tinker with one of the screws. \"Hm-m-m,\"\nhe said after a minute. \"Does things, all right. She goes through\nsome kind of resonance point or something. There is a spot of minimum\ncurrent here. There! I've hit it. Now for the other one.\"\n\nFor an hour, Barney tinkered with first one screw and then the other\none. He found a point where the minimum current was really low; the two\nscrews were interdependent and only by adjusting them alternately was\nhe able to reach the proper point on each. Then he smiled and thrust\nthe power on full. The current remained at a sane value.\n\n\"Now what?\" asked Barney.\n\n\"I don't know. Anything coming out of the business end?\"\n\n\"Heat.\"\n\n\"Yeah, and it's about as lethal as a sun lamp. D'ye suppose the\nMartians used to artificially assist their crops by synthetic sunshine?\"\n\nBarney applied his eye to a spectroscope. It was one of the newer\ndesigns that encompassed everything from short ultraviolet to long\ninfrared by means of fluorescent screens at the invisible wave lengths.\nHe turned the instrument across the spectrum and shook his head. \"Might\nbe good for a chest cold,\" he said, \"but you wouldn't get a sunburn\noff of it. It's all in the infra. Drops off like a cliff just below\nthe deep red. Nothing at all in the visible or above. Gee,\" he said\nwith a queer smile, \"you don't suppose that they died off because of a\npernicious epidemic of colds and they tried chest-cooking _en masse_?\"\n\n\"I'd believe anything if this darned gadget were found in a populated\ndistrict,\" said Jim. \"But we know that the desert was here when the\nMartians were here, and that it was just as arid as it is now. They\nwouldn't try farming in a place where iron oxide abounds.\"\n\n\"Spinach?\"\n\n\"You don't know a lot about farming, do you?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"I saw a cow once.\"\n\n\"That does not qualify you as an expert on farming.\"\n\n\"I know one about the farmer's daughter, and--\"\n\n\"Not even an expert on dirt farming,\" continued Jim. \"Nope, Barney, we\naren't even close.\"\n\nBarney checked the book once more and scratched his nose.\n\n\"How about that eighty-four cycle supply,\" asked Jim.\n\n\"It's eighty-four, all right. From the Martian habit of using twelve as\na base, I've calculated the number to be eighty-four.\"\n\n\"Diddle that, too,\" suggested Jim.\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Barney. \"It doesn't take a lot to crank that one around\nfrom zero to about fifteen thousand c.p.s. Here she goes!\"\n\n\n\nBarney took the main dial of the beat-frequency oscillator and began\nto crank it around the scale. He went up from eighty-four to the top\nof the dial and then returned. No effect. Then he passed through\neighty-four and started down toward zero.\n\nHe hit sixty cycles and the jackpot at the same time!\n\nAt exactly sixty cycles, a light near the wall dimmed visibly. The\nwallpaper scorched and burst into a smoldering flame on a wall opposite\nthe dimmed light.\n\nBarney removed the BFO from the vicinity of sixty cycles and Jim\nextinguished the burning wallpaper.\n\n\"Now we're getting somewhere,\" said Barney.\n\n\"This is definitely some sort of weapon,\" said Jim. \"She's not very\nefficient right now, but we can find out why and then we'll have\nsomething hot.\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Barney. \"Nobody hates anybody any more.\"\n\n\"Unless the birds who made this thing necessary return,\" said Jim\nsoberly. His voice was ominous. \"We know that only one race of Martians\nexisted, and they were all amicable. I suspect an inimical race from\nouter space--\"\n\n\"Could be. Some of the boys are talking about an expedition to Centauri\nright now. We could have had a visitor from somewhere during the past.\"\n\n\"If you define eternity as the time required for everything to happen\nonce, I agree. In the past or in the future, we have or will be visited\nby a super race. It may have happened six thousand years ago.\"\n\n\"Did you notice that the electric light is not quite in line with the\naxis of the tube?\" asked Barney.\n\n\"Don't turn it any closer,\" said Jim. \"In fact, I'd turn it away before\nwe hook it up again.\"\n\n\"There she is. Completely out of line with the light. Now shall we try\nit again?\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\nBarney turned the BFO gingerly, and at sixty cycles the thing seemed\nquite sane. Nothing happened. \"Shall I swing it around?\"\n\n\"I don't care for fires as a general rule,\" said Jim. \"Especially in my\nown home. Turn it gently, and take care that you don't focus the tube\nfull on that electric light.\"\n\nBarney moved the tube slightly, and then with a cessation of noise,\nthe clock on the wall stopped abruptly. The accustomed ticking had not\nbeen noticed by either man, but the unaccustomed lack-of-ticking became\nevident at once. Barney shut off the BFO immediately and the two men\nsat down to a head-scratching session.\n\n\"She's good for burning wallpaper, dimming electric lights, and\nstopping clocks,\" said Barney. \"Any of which you could do without a\nwarehouse full of cockeyed electrical equipment. Wonder if she'd stop\nanything more powerful than a clock.\"\n\n\"I've got a quarter-horse motor here. Let's wind that up and try it.\"\n\nThe motor was installed on a bench nearby, and the experiment was tried\nagain. At sixty cycles the motor groaned to a stop, and the windings\nbegan to smolder. But at the same time the big tube began to exhibit\nthe signs of strain. Meters raced up their scales once more, reached\nthe stops and bent. Barney shut off the motor, but the strains did not\nstop in the tube. The apparent overload increased linearly and finally\nthe lights went out all over the neighborhood once more.\n\n\"Wonderful,\" said Barney through the darkness. \"As a weapon, this thing\nis surpassed by everything above a fly swatter.\"\n\n\"We might be able to cook a steak with it--if it would take the\nterrific overload,\" said Jim. \"Or we could use it as an insect\nexterminator.\"\n\n\"We'd do better by putting the insect on an anvil and hitting it\nfirmly with a five-pound hammer,\" said Barney. \"Then we'd only have\nthe anvil and hammer to haul around. This thing is like hauling a\nfifty-thousand-watt radio transmitter around. Power supplies, BFO,\ntube, meters, tools, and a huge truck full of spare fuses for the times\nwhen we miss the insect. Might be good for a central heating system.\"\n\n\"Except that a standard electric unit is more reliable and considerably\nless complicated. You'd have to hire a corps of engineers to run the\nthing.\"\n\nThe lights went on again, and the attendant in the substation screwed\nthe blow-point control tighter. He didn't know it, but his level was\nnow above the rating for his station. But had he known it he might not\nhave cared. At least, his station was once more in operation.\n\n\"Well,\" said Barney, getting up from the table, \"what have we missed?\"\n\n\n\nAltas said: \"Now your unit is operating at its correct level. But, son,\nyou've missed one thing. It is far from efficient. Those two leads\nmust be isolated from one another. Coupling from one to the other will\nlead to losses.\"\n\n\"Gosh,\" said Than, \"I didn't know that.\"\n\n\"No, for some reason the books assume that the tower engineer has had\nconsiderable experience in the art. Take it from me, son, there are a\nlot of things that are not in the books. Now isolate those leads from\none another and we'll go on.\"\n\n\n\n\"While you're thinking,\" said Jim, \"I'm going to lockstitch these\ncables together. It'll make this thing less messy.\" Jim got a roll of\ntwelve-cord from the cabinet and began to bind the many supply leads\ninto a neat cable.\n\nBarney watched until the job was finished, and then said: \"Look, chum,\nlet's try that electric-light trick again.\"\n\nThey swung the tube around until it was in the original position, and\nturned the juice on. Nothing happened.\n\nBarney looked at Jim, and then reached out and pointed the big tube\nright at the electric light.\n\nNothing happened.\n\n\"Check your anode voltages again.\"\n\n\"All O.K.\"\n\n\"How about that aligning job?\"\n\nBarney fiddled with the alignment screws for minutes, but his original\nsetting seemed to be valid.\n\n\"Back to normal,\" said Barney. \"Rip out your cabling.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Sure. You did something. I don't know what. But rip it out and fan out\nthe leads. There is something screwy in the supply lines. I've been\ntied up on that one before; this thing looks like electronics, as we\nagree, and I've had occasion to remember coupling troubles.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Jim, and he reluctantly ripped out his\nlock-stitching. He fanned the leads and they tried it again.\n\nObediently the light dimmed and the wallpaper burned.\n\n\"Here we go again,\" said Jim, killing the circuits and reaching for a\nsmall rug to smother the fire. \"No wonder the Martians had this thing\nout in the middle of the desert. D'ye suppose that they were trying to\nfind out how it works, too?\"\n\n\"Take it easier this time and we'll fan the various leads,\" said\nBarney. \"There's something tricky about the lead placement.\"\n\n\"Half power,\" announced Barney. \"Now, let's get that sixty cycles.\"\n\nThe light dimmed slightly and a sheet of metal placed in front of the\ntube became slightly warm to the touch. The plate stopped the output of\nthe tube, for the wallpaper did not scorch. Jim began to take supply\nline after supply line from the bundle of wiring. About halfway through\nthe mess he hit the critical lead, and immediately the light went out\ncompletely, and the plate grew quite hot.\n\n\"Stop her!\" yelled Barney.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"How do we know what we're overloading this time?\"\n\n\"Do we care?\"\n\n\"Sure. Let's point this thing away from that light. Then we can hop it\nup again and try it at full power.\"\n\n\"What do you want to try?\"\n\n\"This energy-absorption thing.\"\n\n\"Wanna burn out my motor?\"\n\n\"Not completely. This dingbat will stop a completely mechanical gadget\nlike a clock. It seems to draw power from electric lights. It stops\nelectromechanical power. I wonder just how far it will go toward\nabsorbing power. And also I want to know where the power goes.\"\n\nThe tube was made to stop the clock again. The motor groaned under the\nload put upon it by the tube. Apparently the action of the tube was\nsimilar to a heavy load being placed on whatever its end happened to\npoint to. Barney picked up a small metal block and dropped it over the\ntable.\n\n\"Want to see if it absorbs the energy of a falling object--Look at\nthat!\"\n\nThe block fell until it came inside of the influence of the tube. Then\nit slowed in its fall and approached the table slowly. It did not hit\nthe table, it touched and came to rest.\n\n\"What happens if we wind up a spring and tie it?\" asked Jim.\n\nThey tried it. Nothing happened.\n\n\"Works on kinetic energy, not potential energy,\" said Barney.\n\nHe picked up a heavy hammer and tried to hit the table. \"Like swinging\na club through a tub of water,\" he said.\n\n\"Be a useful gadget for saving the lives of people who are falling,\"\nsaid Jim thoughtfully.\n\n\"Oh, sure. Put it on a truck and rush it out to the scene of the\nsuicide.\"\n\n\"No. How about people jumping out of windows on account of fires? How\nabout having one of the things around during a flier-training course?\nThink of letting a safe down on one of these beams, or taking a piano\nfrom the fifth floor of an apartment building.\"\n\n\"The whole apartment full of furniture could be pitched out of a\nwindow,\" said Barney.\n\n\"Mine looks that way now,\" said Jim, \"and we've only moved a couple of\ntimes. No, Barney, don't give 'em any ideas.\"\n\n\n\nJim picked up the hammer and tried to hit the table. Then, idly, he\nswung the hammer in the direction of the tube's end.\n\nBarney gasped. In this direction there was no resistance. Jim's swing\ncontinued, and the look on Jim's face indicated that he was trying to\nbrake the swing in time to keep from hitting the end of the tube. But\nit seemed as though he were trying to stop an avalanche. The swing\ncontinued on and on and finally ended when the hammer head contacted\nthe end of the tube.\n\nThere was a burst of fire. Jim swung right on through, whirling around\noff balance and coming to a stop only when he fell to the floor.\nHe landed in darkness again. The burst of fire emanated from the\ninsulation as it flamed under the heat of extreme overload.\n\nThis time the lights were out all over Lincoln Head. The whole city was\nin complete blackout!\n\nCandles were found, and they inspected the tube anxiously. It seemed\nwhole. But the hammer head was missing. The handle was cut cleanly, on\nan optically perfect surface.\n\nWhere the hammer head went, they couldn't say. But on the opposite wall\nthere was a fracture in the plaster that Jim swore hadn't been there\nbefore. It extended over quite an area, and after some thought, Barney\ncalculated that if the force of Jim's hammer blow had been evenly\ndistributed over that area on the wall, the fracturing would have been\njust about that bad.\n\n\"A weapon, all right,\" said Barney.\n\n\"Sure. All you have to do is to shoot your gun right in this end and\nthe force is dissipated over quite an area out of that end. In the\nmeantime you blow out all of the powerhouses on the planet. If a hammer\nblow can raise such merry hell, what do you think the output of a\nsixteen-inch rifle would do? Probably stop the planet in its tracks.\nD'ye know what I think?\"\n\n\"No, do you?\"\n\n\"Barney, I think that we aren't even close as to the operation and use\nof this device.\"\n\n\"For that decision, Jim, you should be awarded the Interplanetary Award\nfor Discovery and Invention--posthumously!\"\n\n\"So what do we do now?\"\n\n\"Dunno. How soon does this lighting situation get itself fixed?\"\n\n\"You ask me.... I don't know either.\"\n\n\"Well, let's see what we've found so far.\"\n\n\"That's easy,\" said Jim. \"It might be a weapon, but it don't weap. We\nmight use it for letting elevators down easy, except that it would be a\nshame to tie up a room full of equipment when the three-phase electric\nmotor is so simple. We could toast a bit of bread, but the electric\ntoaster has been refined to a beautiful piece of breakfast furniture\nthat doesn't spray off and scorch the wallpaper. We could use it to\ntransmit hammer blows, or to turn out electric lights, but both of\nthose things have been done very simply; one by means of sending the\nhammerer to the spot, and the other by means of turning the switch. And\nthen in the last couple of cases, there is little sense in turning out\na light by short circuiting the socket and blowing all the fuses.\"\n\n\"That is the hard way,\" smiled Barney. \"Like hitting a telephone pole\nto stop the car, or cutting the wings off a plane to return it to the\nground.\"\n\n\"So we have a fairly lucid book that describes the entire hook-up of\nthe thing except what it's for. It gives not only the use of this\ndevice, but also variations and replacements. Could we figure it out\nby sheer deduction?\"\n\n\"I don't see how. The tower is in the midst of the Red Desert. There\nis nothing but sand that assays high in iron oxide between Canalopsis,\nat the junction of the Grand Canal and Lincoln Head. Might be hid,\nof course, just as this one was, and we'll send out a crew of expert\nsub-sand explorers with under-surface detectors to cover the ground\nfor a few hundred miles in any direction from the place where we found\nthis. Somehow, I doubt that we'll find much.\"\n\n\"And how do you ... ah, there's the lights again ... deduce that?\"\nasked Jim.\n\n\"This gadget is or was of importance to the Martians. Yet in the Temple\nof Science and Industry at Canalopsis, there is scant mention of the\ntowers.\"\n\n\"Not very much, hey?\"\n\n\"Very little, in fact. Of course the pictographs on the Temple at\nCanalopsis shows one tower between what appear two cities. Wavy lines\nrun from one city to the tower and to the other city. Say! I'll bet a\ncooky that this is some sort of signaling device!\"\n\n\"A beam transmitter?\" asked Jim skeptically. \"Seems like a lot of junk\nfor just signaling. Especially when such a swell job can be done with\nstandard radio equipment. A good civilization--such as the Martians\nmust have had--wouldn't piddle around with relay stations between\ntwo cities less than a couple of thousand miles apart. With all the\njuice this thing can suck, they'd be more than able to hang a straight\nbroadcast station and cover halfway around the planet as ground-wave\narea. What price relay station?\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I'm going to tinker up another one of these and see if\nit is some sort of signaling equipment.\"\n\n\n\nThe door opened and Christine Baler entered. She waved a newspaper\nbefore her brother's eyes and said: \"Boy, have you been missing it!\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Barney.\n\n\"Pixies or gremlins loose in Lincoln Head.\"\n\n\"Huh-huh. Read it,\" said Jim.\n\n\"Just a bunch of flash headlines. Fire on Manley Avenue. Three planes\nhad to make dead-tube landings in the center of the city; power went\ndead for no good reason for about ten minutes. Fa\u00e7ade of the City Hall\ncaved in. Power plants running wild all over the place. Ten thousand\ndollars' worth of electrical equipment blown out. Automobiles stalled\nin rows for blocks.\"\n\nJim looked at Barney. \"Got a bear by the tail,\" he said.\n\n\"Could be,\" admitted Barney.\n\n\"Are you two blithering geniuses going to work all night?\" asked\nChristine.\n\n\"Nope. We're about out of ideas. Except the one that Barney had about\nthe gadget being some sort of signaling system.\"\n\n\"Why don't you fellows call Don Channing? He's the signaling wizard of\nthe Solar System.\"\n\n\"Sure, call Channing. Every time someone gets an idea, everyone says,\n'Call Channing!' He gets called for everything from Boy Scout wigwag\nideas to super-cyclotronic-electron-stream beams to contact the outer\nplanets. Based upon the supposition that people will eventually get\nthere, of course.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I ... we, I mean ... found this thing and we're jolly well going\nto tinker it out. In spite of the fact that it seems to bollix up\neverything from electric lights to moving gears. I think we're guilty\nof sabotage. Fa\u00e7ade of the City Hall, et cetera. Barney, how long do\nyou think it will take to tinker up another one of these?\"\n\n\"Few hours. They're doggoned simple things in spite of the fact that we\ncan't understand them. In fact, I'm of the opinion that the real idea\nwould be to make two; one with only the front end for reception, one\nfor the rear end for transmission, and the one we found for relaying.\nThat's the natural bent, I believe.\"\n\n\"Could be. Where are you going to cut them?\"\n\n\"The transmitter will start just before the cathode and the receiver\nwill end just after the ... uh, cathode.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Obviously the cathode is the baby that makes with the end product. She\nseems to be a total intake from the intake end and a complete output\nfrom the opposite end. Right?\"\n\n\"Right, but it certainly sounds like heresy.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Barney thoughtfully, \"but the thing is obviously\ndifferent from anything that we know today. Who knows how she works?\"\n\n\"I give up.\"\n\nChristine, who had been listening in an interested manner, said: \"You\nfellers are the guys responsible for the ruckus that's been going on\nall over Lincoln Head?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so.\"\n\n\"Well, brother warlocks, unless you keep your activities under cover\nuntil they're worth mentioning, you'll both be due for burning at the\nstake.\"\n\n\"O.K., Chris,\" said Jim. \"We'll not let it out.\"\n\n\"But how are you going to tinker up that transmitter-relay-receiver\nsystem?\"\n\n\"We'll take it from here to Barney's place across the avenue and into\nhis garage. That should do it.\"\n\n\"O.K., but now I'm going to bed.\"\n\n\"Shall we knock off, too?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"Yup. Maybe we'll dream a good thought.\"\n\n\"So long then. We'll leave the mess as it is. No use cleaning up now,\nwe'll only have to mess it up again tomorrow with the same junk.\"\n\n\"And I'll have that--or those--other systems tinkered together by\ntomorrow noon. That's a promise,\" said Barney. \"And you,\" he said to\nChristine, \"will operate the relay station.\"\n\n\n\nAltas said to Than: \"Now that your system is balanced properly, and\nwe have proved the worth of this tube as a replacement, we shall take\nit to the roof and install it. The present tube is about due for\nretirement.\"\n\n\"I've done well, then?\" asked Than.\n\n\"Considering all, you've done admirably. But balancing the device in\nthe tower, and hooked into the circuit as an integral part is another\nthing. Come, Than. We shall close the line for an hour whilst replacing\nthe tube.\"\n\n\"Is that permissible?\"\n\n\"At this time of the night the requirements are small. No damage will\nbe done; they can get along without us for an hour. In fact, at this\ntime of night, only the people who are running the city will know that\nwe are out of service. And it is necessary that the tube be maintained\nat full capability. We can not chance a weakened tube; it might fail\nwhen it is needed the most.\"\n\nThan carried the tube to the top of the tower, and Altas remained to\ncontact the necessary parties concerning the shut-off for replacement\npurposes. He followed Than to the top after a time and said: \"Now\ndisconnect the old tube and put it on the floor. We shall replace the\ntube immediately, but it will be an hour before it is properly balanced\nagain.\"\n\nIt was not long before Than had the tube connected properly. \"Now,\"\nsaid Altas, \"turn it on one-tenth power and we shall align it.\"\n\n\"Shall I use the meters?\"\n\n\"I think it best. This requires perfect alignment now. We've much power\nand considerable distance, and any losses will create great amounts of\nheat.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Than. He left the tower top to get the meters.\n\n\n\nBarney Carroll spoke into a conveniently placed microphone. \"Are you\nready?\" he asked.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said Christine.\n\n\"We're waiting,\" said Jim.\n\n\"You're the bird on the transmitter,\" said Barney to Jim. \"_You_ make\nwith the juice.\"\n\nPower rheostats were turned up gingerly, until Jim shouted to stop. His\nshout was blotted out by cries from the other two. They met in Barney's\nplace to confer.\n\n\"What's cooking?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"The meters are all going crazy in my end,\" said Barney. \"I seem to be\nsucking power out of everything in line with my tube.\"\n\n\"The so-called relay station is firing away at full power and doing\nnothing but draining plenty of power from the line,\" complained\nChristine.\n\n\"And on my end, I was beginning to scorch the wallpaper again. I don't\nunderstand it. With no receiver-end, how can I scorch wallpaper?\"\n\n\"Ask the Martians. They know.\"\n\n\"You ask 'em. What shall we do, invent a time machine and go back\nsixty centuries?\"\n\n\"Wish we could,\" said Barney. \"I'd like to ask the bird that left this\ntextbook why they didn't clarify it more.\"\n\n\"Speaking of Don Channing again,\" said Jim, \"I'll bet a hat that\none of his tube-replacement manuals for the big transmitters out on\nVenus Equilateral do not even mention that the transmitter requires\na receiver before it is any good. We think we're modern. We are, and\nwe never think that some day some poor bird will try to decipher our\ntechnical works. Why, if Volta himself came back and saw the most\nperfect machine ever invented--the transformer--he'd shudder. No\nconnection between input and output, several kinds of shorted loops of\nwire; and instead of making a nice simple electromagnet, we short the\nlines of force and on top of that we use a lot of laminations piled on\ntop of one another instead of a nice, soft iron core. We completely\nshort the input, et cetera, but how do we make with a gadget like that?\"\n\n\"I know. We go on expecting to advance. We forget the simple past.\nRemember the lines of that story: 'How does one chip the flint to make\nthe best arrowhead?' I don't know who wrote it any more than I know how\nto skin a boar, but we do get on without making arrowheads or skinning\nboars or trimming birch-bark canoes.\"\n\n\"All right, but there's still this problem.\"\n\n\"Remember how we managed to align this thing? I wonder if it might not\ntake another alignment to make it work as a relay.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" said Jim. \"I'll try it. Christine, you work these screws at\nthe same time we do, and make the current come out as low as we can.\"\n\nThey returned to their stations and began to work on the alignment\nscrews. Jim came out first on the receiver. Christine was second on the\ntransmitter, while Barney fumbled for a long time with the relay tube.\n\nThen Christine called: \"Fellows, my meter readings are climbing up\nagain. Shall I diddle?\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Barney. \"That means I'm probably taking power out\nof that gadget you have in there. Leave 'em alone.\"\n\nHe fiddled a bit more, and then Jim called: \"Whoa, Nellie. Someone just\nlost me a millimeter. She wound up on the far end.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Barney, \"so we're relaying.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said Jim. \"I've got a ten-ampere meter on here now.\"\n\nBarney adjusted his screws some more.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Jim. \"I'm going to shunt this meter up to a\nhundred amps.\"\n\n\"What?\" yelled Barney.\n\n\"Must you yell?\" asked Christine ruefully. \"These phones are plenty\nuncomfortable without some loudmouthed bird screaming.\"\n\n\"Sorry, but a hundred amps... _whoosh_! What have we got here, anyway?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Christine. \"I was about to say that my input meter is\nrunning wild again.\"\n\n\"Gone?\"\n\n\"Completely. You shouldn't have hidden it behind that big box. I didn't\nnotice it until just now, but she's completely gone.\"\n\n\"I'll be over. I think we've got something here.\"\n\n\n\nAn hour passed, during which nothing of any great importance happened.\nBy keying the transmitter tube, meters in the receiver tube were made\nto read in accordance. Then they had another conclave.\n\n\"Nothing brilliant,\" said Jim. \"We could use super-output voice\namplifiers and yell halfway across the planet if we didn't have radio.\nWe can radio far better than this cockeyed system of signaling.\"\n\n\"We might cut the power.\"\n\n\"Or spread out quite a bit. I still say, however, that this is no\nsignaling system.\"\n\n\"It works like one.\"\n\n\"So can a clothesline be made to serve as a transmitter of\nintelligence. But its prime function is completely different.\"\n\n\"S'pose we have a super-clothesline here?\" asked Christine.\n\n\"The way that hammer felt last night, I'm not too sure that this might\nnot be some sort of tractor beam,\" said Jim.\n\n\"Tractor beams are mathematically impossible.\"\n\n\"Yeah, and they proved conclusively that a bird cannot fly,\" said Jim.\n\"That was before they found the right kind of math. Up until Clerk\nMaxwell's time, radio was mathematically impossible. Then he discovered\nthe electromagnetic equations, and we're squirting signals across the\nInner System every day. And when math and fact do not agree, which\nchanges?\"\n\n\"The math. Galileo proved that. Aristotle said that a heavy stone will\nfall faster. Then Galileo changed the math of that by heaving a couple\nof boulders off the Leaning Tower. But what have we here?\"\n\n\"Has anyone toyed with the transmission of power?\"\n\n\"Sure. A lot of science-fiction writers have their imaginary planets\ncrisscrossed with transmitted power. Some broadcast it, some have\nit beamed to the consumer. When they use planes, they have the beam\ncoupled to an object-finder so as to control the direction of the beam.\nI prefer the broadcasting, myself. It uncomplicates the structure of\nthe tale.\"\n\n\"I mean actually?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. But the losses are terrific. Useful power transmission is\na minute percentage of the total output of the gadget. Absolutely\nimpractical, especially when copper and silver are so plentiful to\nstring along the scenery on steel towers. No good.\"\n\n\"But look at this cockeyed thing. Christine puts in a couple of hundred\namps; I take them off my end. Believe it or not, the output meter at my\nend was getting a lot more soup than I was pouring in.\"\n\n\"And my gadget was not taking anything to speak of,\" said Barney.\n\n\"Supposing it was a means of transmitting power. How on Mars did they\nuse a single tower there in the middle of the Red Desert? We know there\nwas a Martian city at Canalopsis, and another one not many miles from\nLincoln Head. Scribbled on the outer cover of this book is the legend:\n'Tower Station, Red Desert,' and though the Martians didn't call this\nthe 'Red Desert, the terminology will suffice for nomenclature.\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"You notice they did not say: 'Station No. 1,' or '3' or '7.' That\nmeans to me that there was but one.\"\n\n\"Holy Smoke! Fifteen hundred miles with only one station? On Mars the\ncurvature of ground would put such a station below the electrical\nhorizon--\" Jim thought that one over for a minute and then said: \"Don't\ntell me they bent the beam?\"\n\n\"Either they did that or they heated up the sand between,\" said Barney\ncryptically. \"It doesn't mind going through nonconducting walls, but\na nice, fat ground ... blooey, or I miss my guess. That'd be like\ngrounding a high line.\"\n\n\"You're saying that they did bend--_Whoosh_, again!\"\n\n\"What was that alignment problem? Didn't we align the deflecting anodes\nsomehow?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but you can't bend the output of a cathode-ray tube externally\nof the deflection plates.\"\n\n\"But this is not electron-beam stuff,\" objected Barney. \"This is as far\nahead of cathode-ray tubes as they are ahead of the Indian signal drum\nor the guy who used to run for twenty-four miles from Ghent to Aix.\"\n\n\"That one was from Athens to Sparta,\" explained Christine, \"the Ghent\nto Aix journey was a-horseback, and some thousand-odd years after.\"\n\n\"Simile's still good,\" said Barney. \"There's still a lot about this I\ndo not understand.\"\n\n\"A masterpiece of understatement, if I ever heard one,\" laughed Jim.\n\"Well, let's work on it from that angle. Come on, gang, to horse!\"\n\n\n\n\"Now,\" said Altas, \"you will find that the best possible efficiency\nis obtained when the currents in these two resistances are equal and\nopposite in direction. That floats the whole tube on the system, and\nmakes it possible to run the tube without any external power source.\nIt requires a starter-source for aligning and for standby service, and\nfor the initial surge: then it is self-sustaining. Also the in-phase\nvoltage can not better be obtained than by exciting the phasing anode\nwith some of the main-line power. That must always be correctly phased.\nWe now need the frequency generator no longer, and by increasing the\npower rheostat to full, the tube will take up the load. Watch the\nmeters, and when they read full power, you may throw the cut-over\nswitch and make the tube self-sustaining. Our tower will then be in\nperfect service, and you and I may return to our home below.\"\n\nThan performed the operations, and then they left, taking the old tube\nwith them.\n\nAnd on Terra, Sargon of Akkad watched ten thousand slaves carry stone\nfor one of his public buildings. He did not know that on one of the\nstars placed in the black bowl of the evening sky for his personal\nbenefit, men were flinging more power through the air than the total\noutput of all of his slaves combined. Had he been told, he would have\nhad the teller beheaded for lying because Sargon of Akkad couldn't\npossibly have understood it--\n\n\n\n\"You know, we're missing a bet,\" said Jim. \"This in-phase business\nhere. Why shouldn't we hang a bit of the old wall-socket juice in here?\"\n\n\"That might be the trick,\" said Barney.\n\nJim made the connections, and they watched the meters read up and up\nand up--and from the street below them a rumbling was heard. Smoke\nissued from a crevasse in the pavement, and then with a roar, the\nstreet erupted and a furrow three feet wide and all the way across the\nstreet from Jim Baler's residence to Barney Carroll's garage lifted out\nof the ground. It blew straight up and fell back, and from the bottom\nof the furrow the smoldering of burned and tortured wiring cast a foul\nsmell.\n\n\"_Wham!_\" said Barney, looking at the smoking trench. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"I think we'll find that it was the closest connection between our\nplaces made by the Electric Co.,\" said Jim.\n\n\"But what have we done?\"\n\n\"I enumerate,\" said Christine, counting off on her fingers. \"We've\nblasted in the fa\u00e7ade of the City Hall. We've caused a couple of\nemergency flier-landings within the city limits. We've blown fuses\nand circuit breakers all the way from here to the main powerhouse\ndowntown. We've stalled a few dozen automobiles. We've torn or burned\nor cut the end off of one hammer and have fractured the wall with\nit ... where did that go, anyway, the hammerhead? We've burned\nwallpaper. We've run our electric bill up to about three hundred\ndollars, I'll bet. We've bunged up a dozen meters. And now we've ripped\nup a trench in the middle of the street.\"\n\n\"Somewhere in this set-up, there is a return circuit,\" said Jim\nthoughtfully. \"We've been taking power out of the line, and I've been\noblivious of the fact that a couple of hundred amperes is too high\nto get out of our power line without trouble. What we've been doing\nis taking enough soup out of the public utility lines to supply the\nlosses only. The power we've been seeing on our meters is the build-up,\nrecirculated!\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Sure. Say we bring an amp in from the outside and shoot it across the\nstreet. It goes to the wires and comes back because of some electrical\nurge in our gadgets here, and then goes across the street in-phase with\nthe original. That makes two amps total crossing our beam. The two come\nback and we have two plus two. Four come back, and we double again and\nagain until the capability of our device is at saturation. All we have\nto do is to find the ground-return and hang a load in there. We find\nthe transmitter-load input, and supply that with a generator. Brother,\nwe can beam power all the way from here to Canalopsis on one relay\ntower!\"\n\nBarney looked at his friend. \"Could be.\"\n\n\"Darned right. What other item can you think of that fits this tower\nany better? We've run down a dozen ideas, but this works. We may be\narrested for wrecking Lincoln Head, but we'll get out as soon as this\ndingbat hits the market. Brother, what a find!\"\n\n\"Fellows, I think you can make your announcement now,\" smiled\nChristine. \"They won't burn you at the stake if you can bring electric\npower on a beam of pure nothing. This time you've hit the jackpot!\"\n\n\n\nIt is six thousand Terran Years since Sargon of Akkad held court that\nwas lighted by torch. It is six thousand years, Terran, since Than\nand Altas replaced the link in a power system that tied their cities\ntogether.\n\nIt is six thousand years since the beam tower fell into the Red Desert\nand the mighty system of beamed power became lost as an art. But once\nagain the towers dot the plains, not only of Mars, but of Venus and\nTerra, too.\n\nAnd though they are of a language understood by the peoples of three\nworlds, the manuals of instruction would be as cryptic to Than as his\nmanual was to Barney Carroll and Jim Baler.\n\nPeople will never learn.\n\n\nTHE END.\n",
