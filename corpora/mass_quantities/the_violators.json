    "body": "He was excited, the little man with the big find.\n\nHe drove his battered old space tub down at the world which lay frozen\nover and lifeless since long ago. But not completely abandoned. Far\nfrom it.\n\nHe joined the long line of ships making the pilgrimage to the ancient,\noriginal home of the human race. Below lay a transparent dome, the\nlargest Z-model of 100,000 capacity, into whose ample entry locks the\nships filed down, one by one. Some had to circle, waiting their turn.\nHe licked his lips impatiently. At times he grinned and savored the\ndelay, in view of what lay ahead.\n\nAt last he chugged in and parked his grimy little tub beside shiny\nyachts and towering spaceliners and spacebuses. The canned air of the\ndome was fresh to his lungs, compared to the reek of his cabin. He dug\na tip out of his frayed jeans for the parking attendant, not quite\ndaring to snub him. He winced at the sneer over the small coin.\n\nBut no more sneers like that, soon. And plenty more money, with what he\nhad in his bag. He smiled and mumbled as he walked away, swinging the\nleather bag at his side, bulging with something angular.\n\nHe filed his way among others toward the turnstiles leading to the main\nexhibit area. Tourists, vacationers, families with kids, school groups,\nnewsmen, galactic trotters, earnest scholars. You could find all types\nhere, from every walk of life and from any distant planet, drawn like\na magnet to this \"must\" for all travelers. It was _the_ sight to see\naround the Milky Way.\n\nCertainly nothing could beat its appeal as the birthplace of mankind.\nNothing, that is, except the gay and fabulous Carnival of Castor,\nwhose attendance record could never be topped.\n\nHe tried to rush through the turnstile but was halted by the green-clad\nguard.\n\n\"I'm in a hurry, mister,\" he mumbled in his wispy voice, from an\noxygen-burned throat. He began opening his bag. \"Look what I found--\"\n\nThe guard heard not a word. \"We keep a register of all visitors to\nMother Earth. Name? Home World? Occupation?\"\n\nIt was odd how even the guard's routine voice lowered a tone on the\nwords \"Mother Earth.\"\n\n\"Lem Starglitter Blake,\" said the little old man in unkempt jeans and\npatched boots.\n\nThe guard's lip twitched slightly. Lem Blake wished he had left out the\nmiddle name. Why had parents of that generation taken to such frothy\nnames? Red-faced, Blake went on with a rush. \"Born on Antares IV.\nProspector for ore strikes. But listen, I made the biggest strike of\nall. Not ore but--\"\n\n\"Next,\" said the guard.\n\nLem Blake swallowed the rest and moved on. People wouldn't treat him\nthat way later, he consoled himself in secret gloating, clutching his\nbag. He could take it for a short time more without bitterness.\n\nAnother guard eyed the bag sternly. \"I must warn you, sir, there is no\nsouvenir hunting allowed here. Understand, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to take anything,\" Blake tried to protest. \"I'm bringing\nsomething--\"\n\n\"Your bag will be emptied and examined when you leave,\" dismissed the\nguard.\n\nThey were all so big and important in their flashy uniforms. But just\nwait, thought Blake, just wait. We'll see who's big and important\nlater.\n\nBut Blake could see why they were so cautious. All around, enclosed in\nthe giant plastic bubble, were the hoary ruins of a city, moldered to\nfragility. If the hordes of visitors were allowed to snatch souvenirs,\nthe place would be picked clean as a bone.\n\nANCIENT NEW YORK, said a sign, MAIN CITY OF HOME EARTH IN PRE-SPACE\nDAYS.\n\nPeople stared in the proper awe due such time-honored relics of antique\nglory. It was from this terribly old civilization that the race of\nstarmen had sprung, inheriting the galaxy. Various individual exhibits\namong the ruins were labeled--a broken wheel, a shred of tapestry under\nglass, a coil of wire, pottery, bits of jewelry, a bleached human\nskull. Odds and ends that had escaped the incinerator of time. There\nwasn't much left after 140 rock-wearing centuries.\n\nPriceless, those few dozens of relics. Lem Blake grew excited again at\nwhat lay in his bag. It would command a price, maybe enough to stake\nhim to years of good food, new clothes, his tub overhauled, leisure and\nfun. Maybe more, much more. It all depended.\n\nBlake knew all the busy guards would ignore him. He must reach higher\nauthority. He hurried to the central auditorium where the staff\nlecturer spoke sonorously to the hushed crowd packed shoulder to elbow.\nBlake took a long breath at the outer fringes and began squeezing his\nway closer to the rostrum. It was slow work in the human jam. He heard\nthe speech as he struggled on.\n\n\"--though today we are born and live and die on many worlds, my fellow\nhumans, we all come from the original stock of this particular planet.\nIt was from this small and quite backward 20th century world that\nmankind leaped to the stars.\"\n\nLem Blake suddenly choked on a chuckling thought in the dead quiet\nof the listening throng. A circle of eyes transfixed him at the\nunspeakable crime. Mumbling apologies, Blake pressed on.\n\nProfessor John Nova McKay went on with the stock lecture. How many\ntimes had it been repeated now, some 80,000? He himself had delivered\nit over a thousand times. It was hard to keep the monotony out of his\ntones.\n\n\"Ships roared into space at the end of the 20th century. First, to\nexplore and pioneer on nearby worlds of the same sun. By the 25th\ncentury, they had the Hyper Drive, permitting speeds greater than\nlight. Then began the second phase of building a galactic commonwealth.\nThose were days of glory.\"\n\nThe speaker tried to lift his voice on those words but it fell flat\nin his own ears. But the audience hung on it, caught in the dramatic\nthought that their own feet stood where all that had started.\n\n\"This is all ancient space history going back 14,000 years, and many of\nits details and records are lost. But we know that by the 30th century\nwe humans ranged all through the Milky Way, settling, colonizing,\nsetting up trade with native races. Worlds existed in vast numbers,\nmany habitable.\"\n\nBlake stopped muttering apologies as he elbowed his way inch by inch.\nThe apologies drew frosty frowns, and were the last thing they wanted.\nThey wanted silence. Only Blake's bag insisted on clanking now and\nthen. He kept on doggedly.\n\nProfessor McKay's voice rolled over the rapt faces. \"Today, there are\nover a million commonwealth planets, about half under native rule,\nfriendly to us. On the other half no native intelligence survived, and\nthey thus became our own home planets. Earthmen came to dominate the\ngalaxy but only in the sense that they were the single largest and most\nprolific race.\"\n\nMcKay's dry voice quickened now, as the most unique part of the stock\nhistorical story came at last. \"But strangely, during that era of\ngalactic expansion, Earth itself gradually faded out of the picture.\nMore and more people left, seeking better homes, richer opportunities,\nmore desirable locations and neighborhoods in the galaxy. Population\nfell on Earth.\n\n\"This was all hastened and brought to a focus when the sun of Earth\nsuddenly began dimming in the 49th century. An old star, that sun\ndied. In a short time, by the cosmic clock, another ice age fell on\nEarth--the final one. The oceans froze solid and all land areas turned\nto bleak wasteland.\"\n\nThere was a suitable pause at this point for the audience to weigh\nthat calamitous event. People stood hushed, half in ancient sorrow.\n\nBlake stopped, hardly daring to breathe. One clank now and he might be\nthrown out.\n\n\"Of course, long before the final death of the planet, the last\nEarthmen had left for other waiting homes. There was no swift storylike\ndoom. No panic or hardship or loss of life. And then, perhaps\ninevitably but still queerly, Earth receded in all human memory and was\nforgotten.\"\n\nThe speaker paused again. It always came on cue here, a gasp from the\naudience, as certainly as the \"ahs\" and \"ohs\" of a fireworks display.\nThe bald statement always had its shock effect on any audience, and\nhere on hallowed Earth itself.\n\nLem Starglitter Blake resumed his slow progress toward the rostrum,\nglad for the noise.\n\n\n\nProfessor McKay braced himself, winced, and went on. Who had written\nthe original purple prose for the lecture? Yet it could not be changed\nnow. Not without an act of the Galactic Congress.\n\n\"Yes, Mother Earth was forgotten and abandoned as it floated frozen and\nlifeless about its dying primary. Forlorn, deserted. Nobody came to\nvisit Earth any more, for any reason. Nor any of its sister planets, as\nthey too were sheathed in ice. Earth became a ghost world.\n\n\"And as centuries marched on, with humanity busy on many thriving\nworlds, all records were lost as to where Earth might be. Earth fell\ninto the category of a vague legend, known only to be a frozen globe\ncircling a sun once typed G-O. But there were a hundred such. Which one\nwas Earth's sun? Nobody knew any more.\"\n\nBlake stepped on somebody's toes and was roundly cursed. But he kept\non, clutching his bag. They'd be sorry. All this would change when he\nshowed what he had.\n\n\"Imagine it, friends. By the 100th century, even the name 'Earth' had\nfaded from collective memory. Most humans living and dying on the\nworlds of Arcturus, Vega, Pollux or any others didn't even know that\nthe race had come from Earth originally. They almost thought themselves\nnative life. We no longer called ourselves Earthmen by then. That term\nfell into discard too. We were Starmen. And so, for an age, lonely\nEarth was lost in space, unsung, unknown, unhallowed.\"\n\nMcKay went on by rote, thinking of dinner.\n\n\"It was not till the 130th century that the Galactic Historical Society\ndecided to make a shrine of Mother Earth, original home of the Starmen,\nas turned up in a musty record. But where _was_ Earth? Vague records\nhelped nothing. Picture how aghast they were. Finally, they had to\norganize a galactic hunt for Earth that took a century.\"\n\nLem Blake sweated as he forged on through the packed crowd. If only his\nbag didn't bump against shins producing two noises, one metallic, the\nother human and angry. But later, when they heard, they wouldn't mind.\nBlake grinned. Maybe they'd tell of it proudly.\n\n\"The ships searched everywhere for unmarked Earth, known only to be a\nfrozen world of a dead sun. It was not even known how many planets had\ncircled Earth's sun. Some thought three, others nine, again thirteen.\nNobody could submit proof one way or another, so it became a blind\nsearch in a cosmic haystack. A star search.\n\n\"The only real clue was that it must be in the vicinity of Sirius,\nsince it was known that such star systems as Centauri, Barnard and\nEpsilon Eridani held the earliest colonies of Starmen. Earth had to be\nsomewhere among this general group, since the Starmen expanded outward\nslowly, jumping from near stars to far stars.\n\n\"All frozen worlds among that narrowed-down group were visited, for any\ntell-tale signs as to which would be Earth itself. They often had to\nburn down with atomic torches through glacial ice to examine ancient\nruins.\"\n\nBlake glared back at an indignant glare. He grew bolder as his goal\nneared. Not far now, another hundred feet.\n\n\"Ultimately, the most likely evidence pointed to one certain planet:\nthe one we stand on today. Under the ice and hoar frost was found this\nancient city whose ruins now surround you. A few scraps of chiseled\nwording on cornerstones matched the earliest writings of Earth we know\nof, at least prior to the 30th century. And so, we had found the\nforgotten world, Mother Earth.\"\n\nMcKay remembered to make his voice ring just in time.\n\n\"The GHS then enthusiastically gave Earth its deserved and honored\nniche in galactic history. A dome, many times replaced and enlarged,\nwas set up around the city ruins. Precious ruins, for they proved the\nonly ones found on Earth. All else had vanished to dust. Visitors were\nwelcomed. Earth became a shrine. In the past nine centuries, no less\nthan twelve billions of our scattered people, from all corners of the\ngalaxy, have made the pilgrimage here to home Earth.\"\n\nBlake was close now, panting, not caring how he swung the bag. McKay\nwas close now, too, to the end of his lecture.\n\n\"Think once, my galactic fellowmen. This we believe was New York, main\nmetropolis of ancient Earth. The then-existing oceans are gone, the\ncontinents utterly changed and jumbled, and the day is far longer than\nat that time. Everything of that long past era is obliterated in dusty\ntime, except these few ruins.\n\n\"But this is Earth. Our home planet. Our Mother World. In reverent\nhonor to our vanished ancestors of this alpha world, we ask that you\nbow your heads in silent tribute for a moment.\"\n\n\n\nBlake had just reached the rostrum and was yelling, \"Hey, Mr. Speaker.\nI'm Lem Blake and I got something to show you--\"\n\nBlake froze in horror even as his weak voice rang out like a gong in\nthe pin-drop silence that had just fallen. But what did it matter now?\nHe leaped on the rostrum before the startled lecturer.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Blake hurriedly. \"Listen what I found--\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" hissed McKay, snapping off the sound system. \"Nothing like\nthis happened in 900 years, a lecture interrupted. You fool. Don't ruin\nit all for them. See me later.\"\n\nMcKay tried to shove Blake bodily off the platform. But Blake twisted\nfree. If he did not go through with it now, guards would come and\nhustle him out of the dome.\n\n\"Look, here in my bag,\" he begged. \"An old-time relic, one I stumbled\non looking for paydirt under deep ice. I knew it was a real old timer\nwhen I saw it. Maybe it's the biggest strike I ever made.\"\n\nMcKay took his hand away from Blake's collar. \"Another relic of Earth,\nyou mean? They're so scarce ... let me see it. Hurry, man.\"\n\nAt last Blake fumbled it out of his bag and held it up.\n\nTwo cross-pieces of rusted metal, welded at right angles to a common\nbar, freakishly preserved by some oily patina, and with lettering still\nlegible in white. From under glacial ice, it must be old as old.\n\nFIFTH AVENUE read one cross-piece, to Professor McKay's trained eye.\nThe other, 42nd STREET.\n\nHe stared.\n\nBlake grinned suddenly. \"And you know where I found it? Not here on\nProcyon V but over on Sol III. You know, about eleven light-years\ngalactic east.\"\n\nBlake grinned more, shrewdly measuring what he saw in McKay's face, and\nlet go his bombshell, whose fuse had been burning uncertainly inside\nhim all this time. \"So this was the wrong Earth all the time, eh? Guess\nthat really rocks you. It'll rock the galaxy too. I'll be famous--\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" hissed the professor, signalling guards. \"You're\nmistaken ... that is--but I'll explain later.\"\n\nAs the guards dragged Blake off, McKay said, \"Take him to my office.\nSee that he keeps his mouth shut till I get there.\"\n\nIn a moment, the reconnected sound system blared out to the puzzled\naudience--\"Please pardon the rude interruption. And in conclusion, as\nwe stand reverently on Mother Earth--\"\n\n_My gawd! Did he think he was the first one? And did he think we'd\nchange now after nine hundred years?_\n\n\n\n\n",
