    "body": "When its turn came, the private secretary, somewhat apologetically, laid\nthe letter in front of the Wisest Man in Wall Street.\n\n\u201cFrom Mrs. Austin, probation officer, Court of General Sessions,\u201d he\nexplained. \u201cWants a letter about Spear. He\u2019s been convicted of theft.\nComes up for sentence Tuesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpear?\u201d repeated Arnold Thorndike.\n\n\u201cYoung fellow, stenographer, used to do your letters last summer going\nin and out on the train.\u201d\n\nThe great man nodded. \u201cI remember. What about him?\u201d\n\nThe habitual gloom of the private secretary was lightened by a grin.\n\n\u201cWent on the loose; had with him about five hundred dollars belonging to\nthe firm; he\u2019s with Isaacs & Sons now, shoe people on Sixth Avenue. Met\na woman, and woke up without the money. The next morning he offered to\nmake good, but Isaacs called in a policeman. When they looked into it,\nthey found the boy had been drunk. They tried to withdraw the charge,\nbut he\u2019d been committed. Now, the probation officer is trying to get the\njudge to suspend sentence. A letter from you, sir, would--\u201d\n\nIt was evident the mind of the great man was elsewhere. Young men who,\ndrunk or sober, spent the firm\u2019s money on women who disappeared before\nsunrise did not appeal to him. Another letter submitted that morning\nhad come from his art agent in Europe. In Florence he had discovered the\nCorreggio he had been sent to find. It was undoubtedly genuine, and he\nasked to be instructed by cable. The price was forty thousand dollars.\nWith one eye closed, and the other keenly regarding the inkstand,\nMr. Thorndike decided to pay the price; and with the facility of long\npractice dismissed the Correggio, and snapped his mind back to the\npresent.\n\n\u201cSpear had a letter from us when he left, didn\u2019t he?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat he\nhas developed into, SINCE he left us--\u201d he shrugged his shoulders. The\nsecretary withdrew the letter, and slipped another in its place.\n\n\u201cHomer Firth, the landscape man,\u201d he chanted, \u201cwants permission to use\nblue flint on the new road, with turf gutters, and to plant silver firs\neach side. Says it will run to about five thousand dollars a mile.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d protested the great man firmly, \u201cblue flint makes a country place\nlook like a cemetery. Mine looks too much like a cemetery now. Landscape\ngardeners!\u201d he exclaimed impatiently. \u201cTheir only idea is to insult\nnature. The place was better the day I bought it, when it was running\nwild; you could pick flowers all the way to the gates.\u201d Pleased that\nit should have recurred to him, the great man smiled. \u201cWhy, Spear,\u201d he\nexclaimed, \u201calways took in a bunch of them for his mother. Don\u2019t you\nremember, we used to see him before breakfast wandering around the\ngrounds picking flowers?\u201d Mr. Thorndike nodded briskly. \u201cI like his\ntaking flowers to his mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe SAID it was to his mother,\u201d suggested the secretary gloomily.\n\n\u201cWell, he picked the flowers, anyway,\u201d laughed Mr. Thorndike. \u201cHe didn\u2019t\npick our pockets. And he had the run of the house in those days. As\nfar as we know,\u201d he dictated, \u201che was satisfactory. Don\u2019t say more than\nthat.\u201d\n\nThe secretary scribbled a mark with his pencil. \u201cAnd the landscape man?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him,\u201d commanded Thorndike, \u201cI want a wood road, suitable to a\nfarm; and to let the trees grow where God planted them.\u201d\n\nAs his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike\nwas occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a\nrailroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an\nattack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his\nbusy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic\npolicemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory,\nto recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be\nsentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at\nfull tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered\nwhimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning\nclinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had\nnot given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the\nyoung man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and\nat other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a\nstenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not\nunnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty--frayed,\nimpecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan--at its ease.\n\nThe hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the\nsun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear\npicked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where\nwould young Spear be?\n\nIt was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly\nthat his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same\nimpulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies\ncall him the Wisest Man. He leaned forward and touched the chauffeur\u2019s\nshoulder. \u201cStop at the Court of General Sessions,\u201d he commanded. What\nhe proposed to do would take but a few minutes. A word, a personal word\nfrom him to the district attorney, or the judge, would be enough. He\nrecalled that a Sunday Special had once calculated that the working time\nof Arnold Thorndike brought him in two hundred dollars a minute. At that\nrate, keeping Spear out of prison would cost a thousand dollars.\n\n\nOut of the sunshine Mr. Thorndike stepped into the gloom of an echoing\nrotunda, shut in on every side, hung by balconies, lit, many stories\noverhead, by a dirty skylight. The place was damp, the air acrid with\nthe smell of stale tobacco juice, and foul with the presence of many\nunwashed humans. A policeman, chewing stolidly, nodded toward an\nelevator shaft, and other policemen nodded him further on to the office\nof the district attorney. There Arnold Thorndike breathed more freely.\nHe was again among his own people. He could not help but appreciate the\ndramatic qualities of the situation; that the richest man in Wall Street\nshould appear in person to plead for a humble and weaker brother. He\nknew he could not escape recognition, his face was too well known, but,\nhe trusted, for the sake of Spear, the reporters would make no display\nof his visit. With a deprecatory laugh, he explained why he had come.\nBut the outburst of approbation he had anticipated did not follow.\n\nThe district attorney ran his finger briskly down a printed card.\n\u201cHenry Spear,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthat\u2019s your man. Part Three, Judge Fallon.\nAndrews is in that court.\u201d He walked to the door of his private office.\n\u201cAndrews!\u201d he called.\n\nHe introduced an alert, broad-shouldered young man of years of much\nindiscretion and with a charming and inconsequent manner.\n\n\u201cMr. Thorndike is interested in Henry Spear, coming up for sentence\nin Part Three this morning. Wants to speak for him. Take him over with\nyou.\u201d\n\nThe district attorney shook hands quickly, and retreated to his private\noffice. Mr. Andrews took out a cigarette and, as he crossed the floor,\nlit it.\n\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d he commanded. Somewhat puzzled, slightly annoyed, but\nenjoying withal the novelty of the environment and the curtness of his\nreception, Mr. Thorndike followed. He decided that, in his ignorance, he\nhad wasted his own time and that of the prosecuting attorney. He should\nat once have sent in his card to the judge. As he understood it, Mr.\nAndrews was now conducting him to that dignitary, and, in a moment, he\nwould be free to return to his own affairs, which were the affairs of\ntwo continents. But Mr. Andrews led him to an office, bare and small,\nand offered him a chair, and handed him a morning newspaper. There\nwere people waiting in the room; strange people, only like those Mr.\nThorndike had seen on ferry-boats. They leaned forward toward young Mr.\nAndrews, fawning, their eyes wide with apprehension.\n\nMr. Thorndike refused the newspaper. \u201cI thought I was going to see the\njudge,\u201d he suggested.\n\n\u201cCourt doesn\u2019t open for a few minutes yet,\u201d said the assistant district\nattorney. \u201cJudge is always late, anyway.\u201d\n\nMr. Thorndike suppressed an exclamation. He wanted to protest, but his\nclear mind showed him that there was nothing against which, with reason,\nhe could protest. He could not complain because these people were not\napparently aware of the sacrifice he was making. He had come among them\nto perform a kindly act. He recognized that he must not stultify it by a\nshow of irritation. He had precipitated himself into a game of which he\ndid not know the rules. That was all. Next time he would know better.\nNext time he would send a clerk. But he was not without a sense of\nhumor, and the situation as it now was forced upon him struck him as\namusing. He laughed good-naturedly and reached for the desk telephone.\n\n\u201cMay I use this?\u201d he asked. He spoke to the Wall Street office. He\nexplained he would be a few minutes late. He directed what should be\ndone if the market opened in a certain way. He gave rapid orders on many\ndifferent matters, asked to have read to him a cablegram he expected\nfrom Petersburg, and one from Vienna.\n\n\u201cThey answer each other,\u201d was his final instruction. \u201cIt looks like\npeace.\u201d\n\nMr. Andrews with genial patience had remained silent. Now he turned\nupon his visitors. A Levantine, burly, unshaven, and soiled, towered\ntruculently above him. Young Mr. Andrews with his swivel chair tilted\nback, his hands clasped behind his head, his cigarette hanging from his\nlips, regarded the man dispassionately.\n\n\u201cYou gotta hell of a nerve to come to see me,\u201d he commented cheerfully.\nTo Mr. Thorndike, the form of greeting was novel. So greatly did it\ndiffer from the procedure of his own office, that he listened with\ninterest.\n\n\u201cWas it you,\u201d demanded young Andrews, in a puzzled tone, \u201cor your\nbrother who tried to knife me?\u201d Mr. Thorndike, unaccustomed to cross\nthe pavement to his office unless escorted by bank messengers and\nplain-clothes men, felt the room growing rapidly smaller; the figure of\nthe truculent Greek loomed to heroic proportions. The hand of the banker\nwent vaguely to his chin, and from there fell to his pearl pin, which he\nhastily covered.\n\n\u201cGet out!\u201d said young Andrews, \u201cand don\u2019t show your face here--\u201d\n\nThe door slammed upon the flying Greek. Young Andrews swung his swivel\nchair so that, over his shoulder, he could see Mr. Thorndike. \u201cI don\u2019t\nlike his face,\u201d he explained.\n\nA kindly eyed, sad woman with a basket on her knee smiled upon Andrews\nwith the familiarity of an old acquaintance.\n\n\u201cIs that woman going to get a divorce from my son,\u201d she asked, \u201cnow that\nhe\u2019s in trouble?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that he\u2019s in Sing Sing?\u201d corrected Mr. Andrews. \u201cI HOPE so! She\ndeserves it. That son of yours, Mrs. Bernard,\u201d he declared emphatically,\n\u201cis no good!\u201d\n\nThe brutality shocked Mr. Thorndike. For the woman he felt a thrill of\nsympathy, but at once saw that it was superfluous. From the secure and\nlofty heights of motherhood, Mrs. Bernard smiled down upon the assistant\ndistrict attorney as upon a naughty child. She did not even deign a\nprotest. She continued merely to smile. The smile reminded Thorndike of\nthe smile on the face of a mother in a painting by Murillo he had lately\npresented to the chapel in the college he had given to his native town.\n\n\u201cThat son of yours,\u201d repeated young Andrews, \u201cis a leech. He\u2019s robbed\nyou, robbed his wife. Best thing I ever did for YOU was to send him up\nthe river.\u201d\n\nThe mother smiled upon him beseechingly.\n\n\u201cCould you give me a pass?\u201d she said.\n\nYoung Andrews flung up his hands and appealed to Thorndike.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that just like a mother?\u201d he protested. \u201cThat son of hers has\nbroken her heart, tramped on her, cheated her; hasn\u2019t left her a cent;\nand she comes to me for a pass, so she can kiss him through the bars!\nAnd I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s got a cake for him in that basket!\u201d\n\nThe mother laughed happily; she knew now she would get the pass.\n\n\u201cMothers,\u201d explained Mr. Andrews, from the depth of his wisdom, \u201care\nall like that; your mother, my mother. If you went to jail, your mother\nwould be just like that.\u201d\n\nMr. Thorndike bowed his head politely. He had never considered going\nto jail, or whether, if he did, his mother would bring him cake in a\nbasket. Apparently there were many aspects and accidents of life not\nincluded in his experience.\n\nYoung Andrews sprang to his feet, and, with the force of a hose flushing\na gutter, swept his soiled visitors into the hall.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he called to the Wisest Man, \u201cthe court is open.\u201d\n\n\nIn the corridors were many people, and with his eyes on the broad\nshoulders of the assistant district attorney, Thorndike pushed his way\nthrough them. The people who blocked his progress were of the class\nunknown to him. Their looks were anxious, furtive, miserable. They stood\nin little groups, listening eagerly to a sharp-faced lawyer, or, in\nsullen despair, eying each other. At a door a tipstaff laid his hand\nroughly on the arm of Mr. Thorndike.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Joe,\u201d called young Mr. Andrews, \u201che\u2019s with ME.\u201d They\nentered the court and passed down an aisle to a railed enclosure\nin which were high oak chairs. Again, in his effort to follow, Mr.\nThorndike was halted, but the first tipstaff came to his rescue. \u201cAll\nright,\u201d he signalled, \u201che\u2019s with Mr. Andrews.\u201d\n\nMr. Andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs. \u201cYou sit there,\u201d he\ncommanded, \u201cit\u2019s reserved for members of the bar, but it\u2019s all right.\nYou\u2019re with ME.\u201d\n\nDistinctly annoyed, slightly bewildered, the banker sank between the\narms of a chair. He felt he had lost his individuality. Andrews had\nbecome his sponsor. Because of Andrews he was tolerated. Because Andrews\nhad a pull he was permitted to sit as an equal among police-court\nlawyers. No longer was he Arnold Thorndike. He was merely the man \u201cwith\nMr. Andrews.\u201d\n\nThen even Andrews abandoned him. \u201cThe judge\u2019ll be here in a minute,\nnow,\u201d said the assistant district attorney, and went inside a railed\nenclosure in front of the judge\u2019s bench. There he greeted another\nassistant district attorney whose years were those of even greater\nindiscretion than the years of Mr. Andrews. Seated on the rail, with\ntheir hands in their pockets and their backs turned to Mr. Thorndike,\nthey laughed and talked together. The subject of their discourse was one\nMike Donlin, as he appeared in vaudeville.\n\nTo Mr. Thorndike it was evident that young Andrews had entirely\nforgotten him. He arose, and touched his sleeve. With infinite sarcasm\nMr. Thorndike began: \u201cMy engagements are not pressing, but--\u201d\n\nA court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail.\n\n\u201cSit down!\u201d whispered Andrews. \u201cThe judge is coming.\u201d\n\nMr. Thorndike sat down.\n\nThe court attendant droned loudly words Mr. Thorndike could not\ndistinguish. There was a rustle of silk, and from a door behind him\nthe judge stalked past. He was a young man, the type of the Tammany\npolitician. On his shrewd, alert, Irish-American features was an\nexpression of unnatural gloom. With a smile Mr. Thorndike observed that\nit was as little suited to the countenance of the young judge as was\nthe robe to his shoulders. Mr. Thorndike was still smiling when young\nAndrews leaned over the rail.\n\n\u201cStand up!\u201d he hissed. Mr. Thorndike stood up.\n\nAfter the court attendant had uttered more unintelligible words, every\none sat down; and the financier again moved hurriedly to the rail.\n\n\u201cI would like to speak to him now before he begins,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nMr. Andrews stared in amazement. The banker had not believed the young\nman could look so serious.\n\n\u201cSpeak to him, NOW!\u201d exclaimed the district attorney. \u2018You\u2019ve got to\nwait till your man comes up. If you speak to the judge, NOW--\u201d The voice\nof Andrews faded away in horror.\n\nNot knowing in what way he had offended, but convinced that it was\nonly by the grace of Andrews he had escaped a dungeon, Mr. Thorndike\nretreated to his arm-chair.\n\n\nThe clock on the wall showed him that, already, he had given to young\nSpear one hour and a quarter. The idea was preposterous. No one better\nthan himself knew what his time was really worth. In half an hour there\nwas a board meeting; later, he was to hold a post mortem on a railroad;\nat every moment questions were being asked by telegraph, by cable,\nquestions that involved the credit of individuals, of firms, of even the\ncountry. And the one man who could answer them was risking untold sums\nonly that he might say a good word for an idle apprentice. Inside the\nrailed enclosure a lawyer was reading a typewritten speech. He assured\nhis honor that he must have more time to prepare his case. It was one\nof immense importance. The name of a most respectable business house was\ninvolved, and a sum of no less than nine hundred dollars. Nine hundred\ndollars! The contrast struck Mr. Thorndike\u2019s sense of humor full in the\ncentre. Unknowingly, he laughed, and found himself as conspicuous as\nthough he had appeared suddenly in his night-clothes. The tipstaffs\nbeat upon the rail, the lawyer he had interrupted uttered an indignant\nexclamation, Andrews came hurriedly toward him, and the young judge\nslowly turned his head.\n\n\u201cThose persons,\u201d he said, \u201cwho cannot respect the dignity of this\ncourt will leave it.\u201d As he spoke, with his eyes fixed on those of Mr.\nThorndike, the latter saw that the young judge had suddenly recognized\nhim. But the fact of his identity did not cause the frown to relax or\nthe rebuke to halt unuttered. In even, icy tones the judge continued:\n\u201cAnd it is well they should remember that the law is no respecter of\npersons and that the dignity of this court will be enforced, no matter\nwho the offender may happen to be.\u201d\n\nAndrews slipped into the chair beside Mr. Thorndike, and grinned\nsympathetically.\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d he whispered. \u201cShould have warned you. We won\u2019t be long now,\u201d\n he added encouragingly. \u201cAs soon as this fellow finishes his argument,\nthe judge\u2019ll take up the sentences. Your man seems to have other\nfriends; Isaacs & Sons are here, and the type-writer firm who taught\nhim; but what YOU say will help most. It won\u2019t be more than a couple of\nhours now.\u201d\n\n\u201cA couple of hours!\u201d Mr. Thorndike raged inwardly. A couple of hours\nin this place where he had been publicly humiliated. He smiled, a\nthin, shark-like smile. Those who made it their business to study his\nexpressions, on seeing it, would have fled. Young Andrews, not being\nacquainted with the moods of the great man, added cheerfully: \u201cBy one\no\u2019clock, anyway.\u201d\n\nMr. Thorndike began grimly to pull on his gloves. For all he cared now\nyoung Spear could go hang. Andrews nudged his elbow.\n\n\u201cSee that old lady in the front row?\u201d he whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s Mrs. Spear.\nWhat did I tell you; mothers are all alike. She\u2019s not taken her eyes off\nyou since court opened. She knows you\u2019re her one best bet.\u201d\n\nImpatiently Mr. Thorndike raised his head. He saw a little, white-haired\nwoman who stared at him. In her eyes was the same look he had seen\nin the eyes of men who, at times of panic, fled to him, beseeching,\nentreating, forcing upon him what was left of the wreck of their\nfortunes, if only he would save their honor.\n\n\u201cAnd here come the prisoners,\u201d Andrews whispered. \u201cSee Spear? Third man\nfrom the last.\u201d A long line, guarded in front and rear, shuffled into\nthe court-room, and, as ordered, ranged themselves against the wall.\nAmong them were old men and young boys, well dressed, clever-looking\nrascals, collarless tramps, fierce-eyed aliens, smooth-shaven,\nthin-lipped Broadwayards--and Spear.\n\nSpear, his head hanging, with lips white and cheeks ashen, and his eyes\nheavy with shame.\n\nMr. Thorndike had risen, and, in farewell, was holding out his hand to\nAndrews. He turned, and across the court-room the eyes of the financier\nand the stenographer met. At the sight of the great man, Spear flushed\ncrimson, and then his look of despair slowly disappeared; and into his\neyes there came incredulously hope and gratitude. He turned his head\nsuddenly to the wall.\n\nMr. Thorndike stood irresolute, and then sank back into his chair.\n\nThe first man in the line was already at the railing, and the questions\nput to him by the judge were being repeated to him by the other\nassistant district attorney and a court attendant. His muttered answers\nwere in turn repeated to the judge.\n\n\u201cSays he\u2019s married, naturalized citizen, Lutheran Church, die-cutter by\nprofession.\u201d\n\nThe probation officer, her hands filled with papers, bustled forward and\nwhispered.\n\n\u201cMrs. Austin says,\u201d continued the district attorney, \u201cshe\u2019s looked into\nthis case, and asks to have the man turned over to her. He has a wife\nand three children; has supported them for five years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the wife in court?\u201d the judge said.\n\nA thin, washed-out, pretty woman stood up, and clasped her hands in\nfront of her.\n\n\u201cHas this man been a good husband to you, madam?\u201d asked the young judge.\n\nThe woman broke into vehement assurances. No man could have been a\nbetter husband. Would she take him back? Indeed she would take him back.\nShe held out her hands as though she would physically drag her husband\nfrom the pillory.\n\nThe judge bowed toward the probation officer, and she beckoned the\nprisoner to her.\n\nOther men followed, and in the fortune of each Mr. Thorndike found\nhimself, to his surprise, taking a personal interest. It was as good as\na play. It reminded him of the Sicilians he had seen in London in their\nlittle sordid tragedies. Only these actors were appearing in their\nproper persons in real dramas of a life he did not know, but which\nappealed to something that had been long untouched, long in disuse. It\nwas an uncomfortable sensation that left him restless because, as he\nappreciated, it needed expression, an outlet. He found this, partially,\nin praising, through Andrews, the young judge who had publicly rebuked\nhim. Mr. Thorndike found him astute, sane; his queries intelligent, his\ncomments just. And this probation officer, she, too, was capable, was\nshe not? Smiling at his interest in what to him was an old story, the\nyounger man nodded.\n\n\u201cI like her looks,\u201d whispered the great man. \u201cLike her clear eyes and\nclean skin. She strikes me as able, full of energy, and yet womanly.\nThese men when they come under her charge,\u201d he insisted, eagerly, \u201cneed\nmoney to start again, don\u2019t they?\u201d He spoke anxiously. He believed he\nhad found the clew to his restlessness. It was a desire to help; to be\nof use to these failures who had fallen and who were being lifted to\ntheir feet. Andrews looked at him curiously. \u201cAnything you give her,\u201d he\nanswered, \u201cwould be well invested.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you will tell me her name and address?\u201d whispered the banker. He was\nmuch given to charity, but it had been perfunctory, it was extended on\nthe advice of his secretary. In helping here, he felt a genial glow\nof personal pleasure. It was much more satisfactory than giving an Old\nMaster to his private chapel.\n\nIn the rear of the court-room there was a scuffle that caused every\none to turn and look. A man, who had tried to force his way past the\ntipstaffs, was being violently ejected, and, as he disappeared, he waved\na paper toward Mr. Thorndike. The banker recognized him as his chief\nclerk. Andrews rose anxiously. \u201cThat man wanted to get to you. I\u2019ll see\nwhat it is. Maybe it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nMr. Thorndike pulled him back.\n\n\u201cMaybe it is,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cBut I can\u2019t see him now, I\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\n\nSlowly the long line of derelicts, of birds of prey, of sorry, weak\nfailures, passed before the seat of judgment. Mr. Thorndike had moved\ninto a chair nearer to the rail, and from time to time made a note upon\nthe back of an envelope. He had forgotten the time or had chosen to\ndisregard it. So great was his interest that he had forgotten the\nparticular derelict he had come to serve, until Spear stood almost at\nhis elbow.\n\nThorndike turned eagerly to the judge, and saw that he was listening to\na rotund, gray little man with beady, bird-like eyes who, as he talked,\nbowed and gesticulated. Behind him stood a younger man, a more modern\nedition of the other. He also bowed and, behind gold eye-glasses, smiled\ningratiatingly.\n\nThe judge nodded, and leaning forward, for a few moments fixed his eyes\nupon the prisoner.\n\n\u201cYou are a very fortunate young man,\u201d he said. He laid his hand upon a\npile of letters. \u201cWhen you were your own worst enemy, your friends\ncame to help you. These letters speak for you; your employers, whom you\nrobbed, have pleaded with me in your favor. It is urged, in your behalf,\nthat at the time you committed the crime of which you are found guilty,\nyou were intoxicated. In the eyes of the law, that is no excuse. Some\nmen can drink and keep their senses. It appears you can not. When you\ndrink you are a menace to yourself--and, as is shown by this crime,\nto the community. Therefore, you must not drink. In view of the good\ncharacter to which your friends have testified, and on the condition\nthat you do not touch liquor, I will not sentence you to jail, but will\nplace you in charge of the probation officer.\u201d\n\nThe judge leaned back in his chair and beckoned to Mr. Andrews. It was\nfinished. Spear was free, and from different parts of the courtroom\npeople were moving toward the door. Their numbers showed that the\nfriends of the young man had been many. Mr. Thorndike felt a certain\ntwinge of disappointment. Even though the result relieved and pleased\nhim, he wished, in bringing it about, he had had some part.\n\nHe begrudged to Isaacs & Sons the credit of having given Spear\nhis liberty. His morning had been wasted. He had neglected his own\ninterests, and in no way assisted those of Spear. He was moving out of\nthe railed enclosure when Andrews called him by name.\n\n\u201cHis honor,\u201d he said impressively, \u201cwishes to speak to you.\u201d\n\nThe judge leaned over his desk and shook Mr. Thorndike by the hand. Then\nhe made a speech. The speech was about public-spirited citizens who, to\nthe neglect of their own interests, came to assist the ends of justice,\nand fellow-creatures in misfortune. He purposely spoke in a loud voice,\nand every one stopped to listen.\n\n\u201cThe law, Mr. Thorndike, is not vindictive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wishes only\nto be just. Nor can it be swayed by wealth or political or social\ninfluences. But when there is good in a man, I, personally, want to know\nit, and when gentlemen like yourself, of your standing in this city,\ncome here to speak a good word for a man, we would stultify the purpose\nof justice if we did not listen. I thank you for coming, and I wish more\nof our citizens were as unselfish and public-spirited.\u201d\n\nIt was all quite absurd and most embarrassing, but inwardly Mr.\nThorndike glowed with pleasure. It was a long time since any one had\nhad the audacity to tell him he had done well. From the friends of Spear\nthere was a ripple of applause, which no tipstaff took it upon himself\nto suppress, and to the accompaniment of this, Mr. Thorndike walked to\nthe corridor. He was pleased with himself and with his fellow-men. He\nshook hands with Isaacs & Sons, and congratulated them upon their public\nspirit, and the type-writer firm upon their public spirit. And then he\nsaw Spear standing apart regarding him doubtfully.\n\nSpear did not offer his hand, but Mr. Thorndike took it, and shook it,\nand said: \u201cI want to meet your mother.\u201d\n\nAnd when Mrs. Spear tried to stop sobbing long enough to tell him how\nhappy she was, and how grateful, he instead told her what a fine son she\nhad, and that he remembered when Spear used to carry flowers to town for\nher. And she remembered it, too, and thanked him for the flowers. And\nhe told Spear, when Isaacs & Sons went bankrupt, which at the rate they\nwere giving away their money to the Hebrew Hospital would be very soon,\nSpear must come back to him. And Isaacs & Sons were delighted at the\ngreat man\u2019s pleasantry, and afterward repeated it many times, calling\nupon each other to bear witness, and Spear felt as though some one had\ngiven him a new backbone, and Andrews, who was guiding Thorndike out of\nthe building, was thinking to himself what a great confidence man had\nbeen lost when Thorndike became a banker.\n\n\nThe chief clerk and two bank messengers were waiting by the automobile\nwith written calls for help from the office. They pounced upon the\nbanker and almost lifted him into the car.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still time!\u201d panted the chief clerk.\n\n\u201cThere is not!\u201d answered Mr. Thorndike. His tone was rebellious,\ndefiant. It carried all the authority of a spoiled child of fortune.\n\u201cI\u2019ve wasted most of this day,\u201d he declared, \u201cand I intend to waste the\nrest of it. Andrews,\u201d he called, \u201cjump in, and I\u2019ll give you a lunch at\nSherry\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe vigilant protector of the public dashed back into the building.\n\n\u201cWait till I get my hat!\u201d he called.\n\nAs the two truants rolled up the avenue the spring sunshine warmed them,\nthe sense of duties neglected added zest to their holiday, and young Mr.\nAndrews laughed aloud.\n\nMr. Thorndike raised his eyebrows inquiringly. \u201cI was wondering,\u201d said\nAndrews, \u201chow much it cost you to keep Spear out of jail?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d said the great man guiltily; \u201cit was worth it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",
