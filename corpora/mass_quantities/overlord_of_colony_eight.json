    "body": "Colony Eight on the _Damballa_ was a huddle of low plastic domes set\nin a clearing of the jungle. It was also the most welcome sight Jim\nReese had seen in a month--the month since he'd quarreled with Lois and\nstruck out into the jungle alone.\n\nHe had covered close to a thousand miles--all the way to Colony Seven,\nthe nearest of the 10 colonies Earth had planted on the jungle world.\nNow he was returning, hoping his month's absence had healed the wounds\nhe and Lois had caused each other. She had had time to think things\nover. So had he--and he still loved her.\n\nHe saw one of the natives straggling through the jungle toward him and\ngrinned. It was drunken old Kuhli, a native who had been accidentally\nmade a drug addict by a well-meaning Terran doctor. Kuhli lived in a\nmurky fog and hung around Colony Eight because he had no place else to\ngo.\n\nReese was happy to see a familiar face, even Kuhli's. He hailed the\nalien.\n\n\"Kuhli! Kuhli, you old devil! Where are you going?\" He knew the native\nrarely ventured into the jungle any more; his delicate sense of\ndirection had long since been blunted by drugs.\n\nThe alien whirled uncertainly and fixed his bleary green eyes on Reese.\n\"Trouble, Earthman,\" he wheezed. \"Go away. Away. Big trouble.\"\n\nReese frowned. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nKuhli came near and rocked unsteadily on the pads of his seven-toed\nfeet. \"Everyone crazy there. Not safe. Trouble, Earthman.\" He moaned\nsoftly to himself. \"Sad things happening.\"\n\nReese glared at the alien; grasped him by his scaly shoulders and shook\nhim. \"Speak up, Kuhli! Is this just another pipedream of yours or is\nthere something wrong in the Colony? I have to know!\"\n\nThe alien whined piteously. \"Don't hurt Kuhli. Don't hurt. Trouble,\nEarthman!\"\n\nReese noticed a pack slung over the creature's back. \"What's in here?\"\n\n\"Mine! Mine! Don't touch!\"\n\nCuriosity impelled Reese to turn the alien around and peer in the\nbulging pack while the old man gibbered in fear.\n\nReese whistled. The pack was brim-full of ampoules of\nbenzolurethrimine, the pain-killing drug to which Kuhli had been made\nan addict. The alien had stumbled into the colony one day, his chest\nslashed open by the talons of a _khaljek_-bird; the colony doctor\nhad administered the drug to ease his agony and only then discovered\nbenzolurethrimine was a powerful narcotic for the aliens.\n\n\"Where'd you get all this stuff?\" Reese demanded.\n\n\"Took it. Needed it. Not going back to Colony any more.\"\n\nThere was something doing there, all right. This was no pipedream of\nKuhli's--not when he was willing to steal a supply of drugs and strike\nout on his own into the treacherous jungle. Reese tightened his lips\nand, started to run toward the nearby colony at a dead trot. He hoped\nLois was all right; he'd never forgive himself for leaving her if\nanything had happened to her.\n\n\n\nHe entered the circle of domes. No one seemed to be around. That was\npeculiar. There should always be a few idling colonists resting up\nbefore continuing their task of clearing the jungles.\n\nFinally he spotted Lloyd Kramer, one of his best friends. He and Kramer\nhad decided together to join and had come out to _Damballa_ on the same\nship.\n\n\"Lloyd! Lloyd!\" Reese ran toward the big man, who was standing stiffly\noutside his hut, staring elsewhere. \"Hey, Lloyd!\"\n\nKramer turned. Reese said, \"I just saw old Kuhli heading through the\nforest with a packload of benzo. He says there's some trouble in the\nColony. What's up? How's Lois? Is she all right?\"\n\nA puzzled frown appeared on Kramer's face. \"Who are you?\" he said in a\ndeep rumbling, voice. \"I do not recognize you.\"\n\n\"What? You crazy, Lloyd? I'm Jim Reese!\"\n\n\"_Jim ... Reese?_\" Kramer repeated the words as if they were some\ntotally alien name. \"Where did you come from, Jim Reese?\"\n\n\"I--what the devil is this, Lloyd?\" Reese backed away suspiciously.\n\"What's happened to you? Where is everyone?\"\n\n\"You do not know,\" Kramer said. \"Therefore you were not here when the\nconversion took place. Therefore I must capture you.\"\n\nHe lunged.\n\nReese got out of the way just as Kramer's six-four body came thundering\ntoward him. He had known Lloyd long enough to be aware of the big man's\nfight-patterns; he could side-step easily enough.\n\n\"Lloyd! You out of your head?\"\n\n\"You must be captured,\" Kramer repeated. He turned and swung his giant\nfists. Reese managed to parry one blow but a massive right crashed\ninto his belly and knocked him gasping back against the thick bole\nof a _ghive_ tree. He clung to the sticky bark for a second, sucking\nin breath. Then, as Kramer advanced again, Reese yanked out his\nhunting-knife. Kramer was unarmed.\n\n\"Lloyd, I don't know what's gotten into you but if you take another\nstep closer to me I'm going to slice you up. You must be crazy!\"\n\nKramer drew back, staring in puzzlement at the gleaming saw-toothed\nblade in Reese's hand. He froze some three yards away.\n\nHe said aloud, \"What should I do, Dr. Tersen? He has a knife.\"\n\nAnd in a cold, unfamiliar voice, he answered himself: \"Keep him there\nat all costs--your life, if necessary. I will send help.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Tersen,\" Kramer said in his own voice.\n\nReese frowned. Tersen? He remembered someone of that name--some\nscientist involved in a scandal a few years back on Earth. But what he\nwas doing here on _Damballa_ and what sort of control was he exerting\nover Lloyd Kramer?\n\n\"I am to keep you from escaping,\" Kramer said flatly. \"Put the knife\naway, Jim Reese.\"\n\nReese glanced past Kramer and saw moving figures--colonists, coming\ntoward him. He recognized them but still there was something unfamiliar\nabout them. They moved stiffly. _Like so many zombies_, Reese thought.\n\nSweat poured down his body. He didn't want to hurt Kramer, not even the\nstrangely-possessed Kramer before him.\n\nStooping quickly, he picked up a handful of the soft, warm _Damballa_\nmud and hurled it into Kramer's face. The big man, blinded, spat out\nmouthfuls of mud. Reese turned and ran.\n\n\"After him!\" Kramer rumbled. \"He's getting away!\"\n\nReese heard a dozen pairs of feet behind him. He dodged back into the\njungle, felt a slimy trailer of vine slap across his face and plunged\ninto a swampy morass covered over with quivering _chulla_-ferns.\n\n\n\nHe crouched there for five minutes, ten, listening while the colonists\nthrashed about searching for him. He felt chilled despite the tropical\nwarmth of the forest.\n\nWho was this Tersen? And what had he done to the people of Colony\nEight? To Lois...?\n\nHe had to find out. Somehow, while he had been gone, Tersen had seized\ncontrol of the minds and bodies of his friends and fellow colonists. He\nheard their voices--steely, unreal.\n\n\"Any sign of him?\"\n\n\"No. He has vanished.\"\n\n\"Dr. Tersen will punish us. We must find him.\"\n\n\"He has a knife. We must be careful.\"\n\n\"No. Dr. Tersen said to capture him even at the cost of our lives.\"\n\nReese shuddered. He recognized those voices, or thought he did. Abel\nLester, Dick Fredrics, Chuck Hylan--men he had worked with and known\nfor years. Hunting him now, as if he were some wild _thruuv_ needed to\nserve as food for the colony.\n\nSomeone passed within three feet of his hiding place and moved on.\nReese was bathed in his own sweat. If he could only stay hidden until\nthey went away, then sneak back into the Colony and find out what had\nhappened, find out if Lois was all right--\n\nA needle of pain shot up his leg. He gasped and tried to keep from\nscreaming.\n\nAnother bright bolt of agony. Another.\n\nNeedleworms! Boring up from the mucky depths of the swamp and\npenetrating the soles of his boots!\n\nHe cursed. The damnable creatures were everywhere. He went into a\nlittle dance, trying to avoid their keen snouts, but there were dozens\nof them, sensing a juicy meal. If he stayed here any longer he'd be\nslowly eaten to death.\n\nClutching his knife tightly he edged out of his shelter, looking\naround. There was no one in sight; the searchers were beating through\nthe underbrush up ahead.\n\nHe moved on tiptoe back toward the village. And suddenly the thick\ncorded arms of Lloyd Kramer shot around him from behind, pinioning him\nin an unbreakable grip. The knife dropped from his hands.\n\n\"All right!\" Kramer called. \"I've got him! Let's go back now.\"\n\n\n\nThree men guarded him as he lay bound in one corner of the Colony\nAdministration Building. Lloyd Kramer, Abel Lester and Mark Cameron,\nLois' father. They had been facing him wordlessly for almost 15\nminutes. None of them would answer his questions--not even when he\nasked Cameron whether Lois was all right.\n\nSuddenly the door opened and a tall, ascetically thin man entered.\nReese knew instantly from the cold set of his features and the fact\nthat his eyes, unlike those of the zombies, burnt with a hard flame of\nintelligence, that this was Dr. Tersen.\n\n\"You can go,\" Tersen said.\n\nThe three guards nodded and left. Reese noticed that a tiny band of\nbright metal encircled Tersen's forehead.\n\nThe scientist looked down at Reese. \"Are you a member of this colony?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Why should I tell you?\"\n\n\"I repeat, James Reese: are you a member of this colony?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Reese said. \"I've been away on a hunting trip the past month.\nWho the devil are you?\"\n\n\"My name is John Tersen, formerly of Earth. You may have heard of me.\"\n\n\"I remember some sort of trial,\" Reese said. \"You were accused of\nillegal experiments of some kind. You were banished from Earth.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. Precisely.\" A film of pain crossed Tersen's lean features.\n\"Exiled from my native world. That was six years ago--six years in\nwhich I've worked alone, on an uncharted planetoid, preparing. Colony\nEight of _Damballa_ represents my first laboratory experiment. After\nthat, the other nine colonies--and then, Earth. I'll have repaid them\nfor what they did to me!\"\n\n\"Do you have this whole colony in your control?\" Reese asked.\n\n\"Yes. All but you--and you'll soon be under the beam too.\"\n\n_That means Lois too_, Reese thought. _What an idiot I was to go away\nand leave her here alone!_\n\nAnd then he realized it was lucky he had done so. If he had stayed\nhere, he'd probably be a zombie like all the rest. At least this way he\nwas a free agent and it was still possible to defeat Tersen--for the\ntime being.\n\nSomething flashed brightly in Tersen's hand. A thin metallic\nbracelet--of the same metal as the band around the scientist's forehead.\n\n\"This is for you,\" Tersen said. \"Since I can't readjust the generator\nwithout losing control of all the others I've prepared a special\ntrinket for you. Let me slip it on you, Reese.\"\n\nTersen reached for Reese's wrist. Reese twisted his body away.\n\n\"Don't be coy,\" Tersen said, smiling bleakly. He slapped Reese and\nseized his wrist. Despite Reese's desperate writhing Tersen managed to\nforce the bracelet over the man's wrist and clamp it shut.\n\n\"There,\" Tersen said. \"Now the whole village is under control.\"\n\nReese was puzzled. He felt no different; evidently something had gone\nwrong. But he did not intend to let Tersen know that.\n\n\"We'll march on Colony Seven tonight,\" Tersen mused aloud.\n\"Everything's ready to begin the conquest.\"\n\nHe stepped behind Reese and undid his bonds. Reese rose to his feet\nstiffly, hoping he made a convincing zombie. He crossed the room toward\nthe door.\n\n\"Join the others,\" Tersen ordered.\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Tersen,\" Reese said in sepulchral tones.\n\n\n\nOutside, he glanced around and saw several colonists some distance\naway. He walked toward them, careful to maintain the stiff walk in case\nTersen were watching.\n\nSomething had gone wrong with Tersen's bracelet because Reese\ndefinitely was under no control. It was a lucky break; it allowed him\nsome extra time to discover what power Tersen held over the enslaved\ncolonists. And he could find Lois.\n\nThe bracelet on his wrist gave no clue. It was just a thin band of\nmetal without ornament. Presumably Tersen had expected to exert some\nkind of thought-control through it.\n\nNone of the colonists wore bracelets of this sort. Therefore, Tersen\nhad some other means of controlling them. He had spoken of a\n\"generator.\" Perhaps he could find that while he remained at large.\n\n\"Hello, Earthman. There is trouble here.\"\n\nMaintaining his stiffness, Reese turned. He saw Kuhli, the addict. The\npack he had been carrying was missing.\n\n\"Why are you back?\" Reese asked.\n\n\"I need.... I need....\" Kuhli gestured to his back. \"I lost my pack. I\nneed....\" He could not pronounce the name of the drug he craved but he\nhad been drawn back to the colony by desperate need.\n\nReese began to say something--then he cut it short and started to run.\n\n\"Lois! Lois!\"\n\nThe girl was walking across the clearing in the familiar stiff-legged\nstride. Reese caught up with her in a moment or two, his heart\npounding. \"Thank God you're all right!\" he exclaimed.\n\nShe stared at him. Her lovely face was void of all expression and her\nhazel-grey eyes looked blankly at him. \"Who are you?\" she asked, as if\nshe were sleepwalking.\n\n\"Why--I'm Jim! Are you under this dreadful thing, too? Yes, yes, of\ncourse you must be. I....\"\n\nShe interrupted him--speaking in a deep, grotesque voice that sounded\nmore like Dr. Tersen's than her own. \"Somehow this Reese is not under\ncontrol. He must be captured and put out of the way. Get him!\"\n\nReese realized that Tersen had been watching through Lois' eyes. Half\na dozen of the colonists were converging on him now. He turned and\nstarted to run.\n\nThey spread out in a loose ring around him and he saw that unless he\ncould dodge past them and escape into the forest, he was trapped.\n\nHe dashed forward toward the nearest man--Chuck Hylan. Hylan was lean\nand agile but Tersen's control left him stiff and awkward. He brought\nhis fists up and aimed a few wild punches at Reese. Reese ducked them\neasily and smashed a hard right at Hylan.\n\nIt was a blow that could have toppled a tree--but Hylan merely\nstaggered and stayed up. Reese saw that the control gave them extra\nendurance. He'd get nowhere by fighting with them. Pushing Hylan aside,\nReese broke for the clearing.\n\nAnd froze.\n\nHe heard Tersen's dry voice saying, \"... must have been a short in the\nwave canal. But that's taken care of now.\"\n\nThe voice was not loud. It was in his mind.\n\nAnd he was unable to move.\n\n\n\nIt was a strange, unearthly experience to be a zombie. Part of Reese's\nmind remained conscious. Part of him knew that Tersen had belatedly\nachieved control through the bracelet on his wrist and that Reese was\nno longer his body's master. He felt a presence in his mind. Tersen.\nTersen dictated his motions now.\n\nStiffleggedly--and it was no sham, now--he turned or _was_ turned, and\nwalked back toward the rest of the group. Tersen had appeared and stood\nthere, icy eyes glittering at him.\n\n\"I made the mistake of not testing you before I freed you,\" the\nscientist said. \"But I think the control is in effect now. We'll see.\"\n\n_Raise your right hand!_ came a sudden mental command. Reese felt his\nright hand shoot above his head. He struggled to pull it down but it\nwas impossible.\n\n_Left hand!_\n\n_Both hands!_\n\n_Kneel on your left knee!_\n\nApparently Tersen was satisfied. He ordered Reese up and turned away.\nHis control was complete.\n\n\"We march on Colony Seven tonight,\" Tersen announced again.\n\nThe rest of that day was a dim blur for Jim Reese. He followed through\na series of dictated tasks, preparing for the raid on the colony. He\ndiscovered now exactly what had happened to Colony Eight but there was\nnothing at all he could do about it.\n\nTersen had appeared about a week after Reese had quarrelled with Lois.\nHe had announced he was here to perform some experiments and asked the\nColony to let him stay for a month or so. The Colony had agreed.\n\nTersen had proceeded to set up a dome and build his generator. It\noperated on encephalographic principles and allowed him to control the\nbrains of all within its field at the time it was turned on. The Colony\nhad not discovered this until the day Tersen had switched the generator\non. From then on all were slaves.\n\nSince Reese had not been present when that happened he was not subject\nto the generator field nor was the generator set up to control him.\nTersen had had a portable generator under experimental construction\nand it was that which he had used to control Reese. It had failed, at\nfirst, though Reese's clever act had deceived Tersen. But when the\nscientist discovered Reese still was not under control he was able to\nmake a trifling adjustment that altered the situation.\n\nThese things Reese found out by his contact with Tersen's mind. Contact\nworked in two directions--but control in only one.\n\nReese and the others readied the Colony for the attack on its\nneighbors. Tersen planned to control all the 10 colonies on\n_Damballa_--and then, building more generators, he would spread his\ndominion to Earth, the planet that had driven him into exile.\n\n\n\nBut one person in Colony Eight was free from Tersen's control. One\nperson came and went as he pleased.\n\nKuhli. The drug-sodden alien.\n\nReese was standing stiffly before the medical commissary later that\nday when Kuhli came out, his back once again laden with a packful\nof benzolurethrimine ampoules. The alien was smiling happily in his\nnarcotic daze.\n\nHe approached Reese and peered at him curiously out of eyes clouded\nwith drugs. \"Earthman. Much trouble here. I leave again.\"\n\nPrisoner within his own skull, Reese longed to break Tersen's iron\ncontrol. But it was impossible. He stood stock-still while Kuhli stared\nat him.\n\nThe alien's blubbery mouth split in a pleased smile. \"Pretty,\" he\ncrooned. \"Pretty. I take.\"\n\nReese's heart bounded in sudden hope.\n\nKuhli's dim eyes were fixed on the shining bracelet on Reese's wrist!\n\nThe alien was pawing his arm now, examining the trinket, exclaiming\nlittle wordless cries of pleasure over it. Reese felt his body\nbreaking out in heavy sweat. If only Tersen wouldn't notice--!\n\nKuhli began to slip the bracelet off.\n\nAnd Tersen detected it. His sudden, urgent thought came to Reese: _Stop\nhim! Don't let him remove the bracelet, Reese!_\n\nUnable to resist, Reese started to draw his hand back, to bring his\nother fist down on the alien's skull. But halfway through the action he\nfelt a shock like a heavy-voltage current ripping through him and knew\nthat he was free. The alien had removed the bracelet!\n\nQuickly Reese seized it, grabbing it from the alien's paws. Despite\nKuhli's protests, Reese hurled the bracelet as far into the underbrush\nas he could.\n\nHe grinned and patted the blubbering alien on one scaly shoulder.\n\"That's all right, Kuhli. Good boy, Kuhli. When this thing is over\nremind me to get you a new bracelet.\"\n\nHe began to run, moving with grim determination now. He was free\nagain--and now he knew where Tersen and his generator were located. He\ndidn't intend to fail a third time.\n\n\n\nTersen had set up his headquarters in one of the small domes near the\nstream that ran past the colony. Blaster in hand, Reese ran to the\ndome.\n\nSomeone stood in the door. Not Tersen.\n\nLois.\n\n\"Don't go in there,\" she said--in her normal voice. \"Tersen's in there.\"\n\n\"I know.\" He stared at her. She didn't have the same zombie-like\nappearance she had had earlier. \"Get out of my way,\" he told her. \"I'm\ngoing in.\"\n\nShe put her hand on his arm tenderly. \"No Jim. Give me the gun. I've\nbroken out of his control. He doesn't know it yet. Let me go in\nthere--and I'll take him by surprise. He won't expect it when I blast\nhim down.\"\n\nA grin lit Reese's features. The voice was unmistakably Lois'. \"Okay.\nGreat idea, darling. Here.\"\n\nHe handed her his blaster and waited for her to go inside. But instead\nshe levelled the gun at him.\n\n\"Lois! What is this--a trap?\"\n\nWords came from her mouth in reply--words spoken in a deep, distorted\nvoice. \"Well done. Now kill him.\" It was the voice of Dr. Tersen.\n\nHer finger tightened on the trigger as Reese stood frozen in utter\nhorror. Tersen had used a shrewd ruse--by pretending to have let Lois\nescape his power he had gotten Reese to surrender his weapon.\n\nBut Lois stood facing him without firing. Sweat broke out on her face.\nShe became deadly pale.\n\n\"Fire!\" Tersen urged, speaking through her mouth. \"Shoot him!\"\n\n\"I--I can't,\" she said hesitantly, \"I--love--him.\"\n\nThe gun dropped from her hand. A moment later she fell in a crumpled\nheap at Reese's feet.\n\nThere was no time to examine her. He snatched up the blaster, stepped\nover her fallen body and burst into the dome.\n\nA purple blast of energy seared the air above him and blew a hole above\nthe door. Instantly Reese dropped.\n\nA compact, whirring pile of machinery confronted him--and, huddling\nbehind an overturned bench, was Tersen aiming a blaster at him. Reese\nflattened himself against the floor.\n\nTersen fired and missed. Reese squeezed the stud of his own blaster and\nashed part of the table behind which Tersen cowered.\n\nHe heard footsteps behind him. The colonists, still under Tersen's\ndomination, were coming to their master's aid.\n\n\"You'd better give up,\" Tersen said. \"They'll tear you to pieces.\"\n\nReese's only reply was another bolt of energy that ripped away the wall\nabove Tersen's head. Tersen fired again; heat bathed Reese's cheek.\n\nThe colonists were practically there now. He could hear them swarming\nup the path to aid Tersen. He fired again--\n\nSquarely into the generator.\n\nLivid blue flames flickered over the complex machinery for a moment.\nTubes melted: connections shorted out. An agonized scream came from\nTersen and he charged forward madly, blinded with rage.\n\nReese didn't need to fire. He simply stepped into Tersen's path and\nsmashed him to the ground with a solid right. Then he turned and pumped\nhis remaining three charges into the burning generator.\n\nA moment later the colonists arrived--but not as Tersen's rescuers,\nas his executioners. Reese got out of their way as the newly-freed\ncolonists rushed in.\n\nWhat was left of Tersen wasn't pretty.\n\n\"It was awful,\" Lois sobbed, outside. \"I knew what he was planning to\ndo and yet I couldn't help myself. I--was like a puppet on a string.\"\n\n\"I know what it was like,\" Reese said. \"He had me under control a while\ntoo--until poor crazy Kuhli decided he liked the way my bracelet shone.\nBut you did help yourself--you didn't fire!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the girl said weakly. \"I struggled--and then somehow I won. I\nsnapped his hold and collapsed. And then--and then--\"\n\nReese smiled. \"It's all over now,\" he said. \"Tersen's dead and his\nmachine's smashed. It had one flaw--it couldn't control love.\"\n\nShe looked up at him. \"You won't go away any more, will you, Jim?\"\n\n\"That's a silly question,\" he said.\n",
