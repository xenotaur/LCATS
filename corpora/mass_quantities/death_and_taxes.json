    "body": "\"It's a crime, Your Honor,\" said the young man with the dreamy eyes and\npaint-smeared sport-shirt. \"The Council not only proposes tearing down\nthis picturesque landmark, but would thereby destroy the home of our\nonly local ghost.\"\n\n\"Really, Mr. Masterson!\" The mayor smiled to show he knew Jerry\nMasterson was only kidding, then brandished a State Highway Commission\nreport recommending that the antiquated Waukeena Lighthouse be\ndemolished. \"Mr. Masterson, we respect your feelings as an artist,\nand are well aware of the local superstition regarding the ghost of\nCaptain MacGreggor, but this building is over seventy years old and\nneeds expensive repairs. The financial burden is too great for our\nmetropolis of less than fifteen hundred souls. The State has disavowed\nresponsibility, and--\"\n\n\"Your Honor!\"\n\n\"The chair recognizes Mr. Higgins.\"\n\n\"As president of the Historical Society, I wish to state we vigorously\noppose the wrecking of this building. One by one, our landmarks have\nfallen. Are we to hand down to our children a community without pride\nof ancestry? Are we--?\"\n\n\"Your Honor,\" bellowed another voice. \"As a member of the Taxpayers\nLeague....\"\n\nFor two hours, sentiment battled hotly with double-entry bookkeeping.\nThen the City Council expressed its deep regrets to the Historical\nSociety--and unanimously accepted the bid of Sam Schultz Salvage\nCompany. Mr. Schultz handed the Council his check for five hundred\ndollars and was authorized to begin wrecking immediately.\n\n\"First thing tomorrow morning,\" Mr. Schultz promised.\n\n\n\nTomorrow morning! As he walked into the spring night, toward the old,\ndecaying house where he lived alone, Jerry Masterson felt sadness. His\nown difficulties had prepared him to admit life was geared to financial\nconsiderations. But things had come to a pretty pass when even a ghost\nwas not safe from dollars and cents. \"Poor Captain Wully,\" he said\nwithout realizing he spoke aloud.\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" said a voice. \"Poor Wully MacGreggor. As a ghost in\ngood standing, a dues-paying member of Asmodeus Local of the United\nLighthouse Haunters of America, Wully never done nothin' to deserve\nthis. Evicted! Got a smoke, matey?\"\n\nJerry Masterson did a double-take. Out of reflex courtesy, he proffered\na cigarette and was about to strike a match when his companion reached\nslightly to the left, where several coals glowed in mid-air. Selecting\none, the stranger said, \"Thank you, Junior. You can go now.\" He turned,\nlit Jerry's cigarette and his own.\n\n\"All right, joker,\" said Jerry. \"Show me how you did it and I'll show\nyou a couple of card tricks and a disappearing penny routine.\"\n\n\"Later,\" said the stranger. \"Right now, matey, my sails is draggin' and\nI need spiritual reinforcement--liquid. And _you're_ buying.\"\n\n\"There's a fifth of Scotch in my studio, but I'm not pouring for any\nphony tricksters. I've been saving it till I sold a canvas.\"\n\n\"Scotch,\" sighed the stranger ecstatically. \"Shades of the Loch Ness\nMonster! Quit scratching, Gertrude.\"\n\n\"Gertrude?\"\n\n\"My cat--she's black. A handsome beastie if you overlook a hole in her\nhead. A twenty-two caliber hole. Gertrude, materialize for the nice\nman.\"\n\nNothing happened, and Jerry diplomatically sought to ease a situation\nthat was rapidly becoming embarrassing. \"Maybe she's bashful.\"\n\n\"Not Gertrude. Just temperamental. She could materialize if she wanted\nto. She doesn't want to. Now take Junior....\"\n\n\"Junior?\"\n\n\"He's the conscientious type. Tries too hard, poor boy.\"\n\n\"About that Scotch,\" said Jerry. \"You don't think maybe a couple of\ncups of black coffee....\"\n\nThe stranger's face registered horror--and trust betrayed. \"For\nshame, laddie. To be insulted in my darkest hour! Me, Captain Wully\nMacGreggor!\"\n\n\"Sure. You're Wully MacGreggor--and I'm Napoleon.\"\n\n\"Watch.\"\n\nThere was nothing to watch. The stranger had disappeared. A disembodied\nvoice said, \"Now about that Scotch? If Waukeena light is being torn\ndown tomorrow, I'll be homeless. I've got a lot of haunting to do in\nthe little time that's left. And here we stand, waggin' our jaws.\"\n\nJerry's first impulse was to run like hell. \"But I don't believe in\nghosts!\" His voice sounded.\n\n\"Of course you do. If you didn't, you couldn't have seen me.\"\n\nHe'd heard of self-hypnosis--apparently the session with the Mayor had\nupset him. \"All right, so you're Wully MacGreggor. Why pick on me?\"\n\n\"Because I like you,\" said the ghost. \"You said a kind word for me to\nthe City Council and I'd like to do something nice for you.\"\n\n\"If you can't help yourself, I don't see how you're going to be much\nhelp to me, but what've I got to lose?\" He was too numb to worry\nfurther. Ghosts, yet...!\n\n\n\nNext morning, Jerry Masterson awoke with a hangover. He dimly\nremembered floating lights, red, yellow, blue and green. He remembered\nCaptain Wully scaring a couple of lovers with noises the young lady\ndescribed as \"something like bagpipes in an echo chamber.\" And he\nseemed to remember that, toward the end of the evening, Gertrude had\ndeigned to materialize--along with a headless black ox and a white stag.\n\nHe shook his head and reached for the aspirin. \"As of now,\" he\npromised himself, \"I'm on the wagon.\" He seemed to recall a snake\ntoo, a seven-headed snake with a gleaming carbuncle in the middle\nhead. _Permanently_ on the wagon! A scraping noise came from above. He\nlistened. The noise occurred again. It seemed to emanate from the tower\nroom on the third floor. He raced up the winding Victorian staircase,\non up the narrow stairs to the attic, and stopped.\n\nFrom behind the tower room door, came thin, eerie skirling of bagpipes.\n\n\"Hey, you in there,\" he called.\n\n\"Matey!\" boomed Captain Wully's voice. \"Come on in.\"\n\nCaptain Wully was seated on an old sea-chest, the bagpipes still tucked\nunder his arm. \"Hope my practicing didn't disturb you. I play second\nbagpipe in the banshee band.\"\n\n\"But the scraping noise....\"\n\n\"My sea-chest. I had a little trouble getting you home by cockcrow, and\nI had to move the sea-chest on overtime. I want to say right now it was\nright decent of you to offer me a home on such short acquaintance. I\nappreciate it, and I promise to show my--\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Jerry. \"All this time I was being so big-hearted, did\nI also say I was going to have to sell the house for non-payment of\ntaxes?\"\n\n\"You didn't. If I'd a-known that, I'd put you wise to grabbing\nCeleste's carbuncle. It's good luck.\"\n\n\"It didn't bring _you_ any luck.\"\n\n\"I'm not eligible. Employees, relatives etc.\"\n\n\"Why can't I get it now?\"\n\n\"Too late. Celeste only materializes once every seven years. Those\ncanvases you mentioned. For sale?\"\n\n\"No bidders, and the critics all agree. Competent draftsmanship, highly\nfinished technique--but carefully unimaginative, middle-class.\"\n\n\"The pictures--where are they now?\"\n\n\"Downstairs. I was going to crate them today, and send them to the Art\nFestival at Northport, but I've got the shakes too bad.\"\n\nCaptain Wully pushed back the tam on his head, scratched his balding\ndome. \"I've got it. You catch yourself a nap, matey. I'll crate the\npictures for you and batten down the hatches all nice an' ship-shape.\"\n\n\n\nJerry Masterson, when he draped himself over the bumpy carvings on\nthe studio love seat, intended to take only a quick forty winks. But\nthe morning was well spent when he awakened, stiff and cramped. Two\nsturdy crates stood near the door and, from the skylight end of the\nstudio, wafted a rich fragrance of latakia. Captain Wully drew deeply\non a Scotch briar filled with Jerry's private blend of tobacco, waved\nhis pipe toward the easel and said, \"A right bonnie lass, matey. Your\nbetrothed?\"\n\nJerry shook his head dolefully. \"Her family are Covered Wagon. You've\nno idea what that means in a small town like this. My uncle lived here\nfifteen years and was still a 'newcomer' when he died and left me the\nhouse. I've been here two years, but that's a Johnny-come-lately to the\nHigginses. Her name's Heather, and I doubt if she knows I'm alive.\"\n\nCaptain Wully twirled his mustache, which curled luxuriantly at either\nend and was of an improbable shade Jerry classified as Hunter's Pink.\nSo was his beard. \"What did you say her name was?\"\n\n\"Heather Higgins.\"\n\n\"You sighed the second time you said it, too. I just wanted to be sure.\"\n\nJerry crossed to the unfinished canvas. \"Hair like sunshine on slightly\noxidized copper. Eyes blue like the sea where it meets the horizon on a\nsummer day.\"\n\n\"_Gertrude!_\" yelled Captain Wully.\n\nFrom the turbulence of the air current which marked Gertrude's\npassing, Jerry decided the invisible cat had been in a hurry.\n\n\"And who are _you_, and what are _you_ doing here?\" Captain Wully\nyelled at a second slipstream.\n\nDistinctly audible was a high pitched caterwauling. In addition, there\nwas a sound that made Jerry's curly hair crawl--the baying of a wolf?\n\n\"I better look into this,\" Captain Wully muttered and dashed outside.\nAs he reached the doorway, his figure melted into transparency, then\ninto air.\n\nJerry loaded the crated paintings into his car and took them to the\nexpress office. They wouldn't sell--they never did. But he couldn't\nafford to pass up the chance that they might.\n\nWhen he returned home, there was no sign of Captain Wully, only a few\npaper candy wrappers on the floor. He started to pick them up, but\nremembered he wanted to imprison a highlight on Heather Higgins's nose\nand forgot the papers.\n\nSomeone had been into his paints. A tube of Payne's gray had been\npressed dry. The cap was off the gamboge, and a new tube of bice green\nhad been squeezed in the middle. Nor had the intruder bothered to\nscrape the palette, which gleamed with puddles of color.\n\nA dab of ivory, the hint of rose madder and a suspicion of cadmium\nyellow fused under his brush tip. Creative fury struck him, and he\nfailed to notice a figure that paused at the outside front gate. The\nfigure stooped, picked up something, then carefully scanned the inside\nwalkway. Here, too, she picked up something. She stooped momentarily on\nthe front porch, and again in the hallway.\n\n\n\nThen Heather Higgins stood in the studio. Her gaze swept the floor, and\nshe bent over to pick up a candy wrapper.\n\n\"You don't have to do that,\" Jerry said. \"I was getting around to\nit--eventually.\"\n\nShe whirled to face him. Her eyes turned from azure to ultramarine.\n\"You might tell me what's going on around here!\"\n\n\"Suppose _you_ tell _me_. I'm still trying to catch up with it myself.\"\n\n\"_Thief!_\"\n\n\"Thief?\"\n\n\"Stealing Scotch whiskey and my new plaid skirt! But you made a mistake\non the rum butter toffee. I trailed the wrappers.\"\n\nThe Scotch whiskey and rum toffee Jerry could see a reason for--but not\nthe plaid skirt. \"So help me, I'm innocent.\"\n\n\"So you're innocent!\" She dashed to a corner behind the easel and\nsnatched a plaid skirt from the floor.\n\n\"You'll just have to believe me. I had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"Oh no?\"\n\n\"Look at me. Do I look like a criminal?\"\n\nAs she looked her expression softened slightly, but she said, \"I always\npicked the wrong picture in psychology tests. It's you innocent looking\nfellows that always turn out to be the crooks.\"\n\nJerry tried his best to look desperate. The result was too much for\nHeather Higgins, who laughed.\n\n\"Hold it,\" Jerry said. \"I want to catch your eyes.\"\n\nHe grabbed his brush and made several quick strokes on the canvas.\n\n\"Why,\" she said, \"it looks like _me_--a little. But I'm not that\npretty.\"\n\n\"You are. And it'd look more like you if I didn't have to do it from\nmemory.\"\n\nAnd that was how Heather Higgins reluctantly happened to promise Jerry\nMasterson she'd return next morning for a sitting. She left, and Jerry\nwas eating dinner when Captain Wully walked in to the whistled measures\nof _Comin' Through the Rye_.\n\n\"_Rye!_\" said Jerry. \"You? Rye?\"\n\n\"I borrowed her old man's Scotch, if that's what you're gettin' at. And\nif you think I enjoyed eatin' all that candy just to leave a trail--I\nhope I don't see another piece of candy for three hundred years.\"\n\n\"Just to satisfy my curiosity,\" Jerry pleaded, \"where does the plaid\nskirt come in?\"\n\n\"The MacGreggor tartan? I needed a kilt.\"\n\n\"All of a sudden you need a kilt. Why?\"\n\n\"It's a long story. But first--\" he reached into a cupboard and\nproduced Jerry's safety razor--\"do you mind if I borrow this? And where\ndo you keep the scissors?\"\n\nIt took fifteen minutes to locate the scissors.\n\n\"We were discussing a kilt,\" Jerry prompted.\n\n\"If a body kiss a body, need a body cry,\" sang Captain Wully's baritone.\n\nBut, eventually, Captain Wully and the scissors were seated at the\ntable behind a round magnifying mirror. \"It begins with Gertrude. You\nremember how she scooted through the studio this afternoon with a\nwerewolf after her?\"\n\n\"How stupid of me not to realize.\"\n\n\"I felt Gertrude needed help. I caught up with the werewolf and gave\nhim a piece of my mind. 'Pretty small potatoes,' I says, 'when a\nwerewolf chases cats. You must be pretty second-rate to have fallen so\nlow. A regular lamb in wolf's clothing.' 'I'll have you know,' he says,\n'I'm pretty hot stuff. Related to Dracula on my mammy's side, and to\nFrankenstein on my pappy's.'\"\n\nThe scissors snipped rapidly, and bits of pink mustache littered the\nunswept floor.\n\n\"'A renegade,' I says. 'Your family must be awfully proud of you.\nChasing cats!' Ouch--\" as the scissors slipped. \"I says, 'Where do you\nlive?' And he says, 'Down the road a piece. I'm lapdog for an Indian\nprincess.' 'I think,' I says, usin' my head real quick like, 'I better\nsee you home and see what your mistress has to say about this.'\"\n\nThe mustache having been whittled to a tailored toothbrush. Captain\nWully started on his beard. \"You should see her, laddie. A real Indian\nprincess, left over from a Lovers Leap. Bein' four hundred years old,\nshe's real aristocracy and doesn't mingle with younger ghosts, which is\nwhy I never seen her before. Myself, I'm three score and hardly in her\nclass. Although I must say she took a shine to me. But Indian braves\ndon't wear beards.\"\n\nCaptain Wully put down the razor and revealed that he too was\nbeardless. \"Sporran, silver buckles and all the fixin's I got in my\nsea-chest--but my kilt went down wi' my ship.\"\n\nWhen Captain Wully realized Heather Higgins had taken the plaid skirt\nhome, he was inconsolable.\n\n\n\nHeather Higgins kept her appointment to sit next morning. She was\ngreeted at the mailbox by a subdued young man, who hastily shoved in\nhis pocket a letter promising drastic action in the matter of \"tax\nliens against property situate, to wit, etc.\"\n\n\"The oddest thing has happened,\" she said.\n\nAnd Jerry knew. \"The plaid skirt is gone again.\"\n\nShe gave him a chilly look. \"See here! For a young man who claims to\nknow nothing about--\"\n\n\"It's my handyman,\" he babbled. \"My handyman's a kleptomaniac.\"\n\n\"Lem Butler's the only handyman in town. Don't try to tell me Lem--\"\n\n\"Since the person concerned is progressing toward a cure, I can't\nmention names. Couldn't you let me pay for the skirt?\" It took a lot of\nfast talking, and it took time--but he finally diverted her attention.\n\nShe was a patient model. He quickly blocked in the flowing waves of her\nhair. But a listening look had come over her. Jerry listened too.\n\nDown the stairwell drifted muted notes of a bagpipe, striving to adapt\nits chromatic limitations to '_Indian Love Call_.' Another instrument\nwas audible also.\n\n\"Funny thing about this house,\" he said. \"When I first moved in, I used\nto think I heard bagpipes.\"\n\n\"Accompanied by a glockenspiel?\"\n\n\"Is that what it is?\"\n\nThe upper half of a very elderly gentleman bobbed in.\n\n\"_Junior!_\" bawled Captain Wully from the stairs.\n\n\"Leave me alone,\" pleaded the elderly gentleman. \"Lemme concentrate.\"\n\nCaptain Wully dashed in. \"For shame, Junior. _Stealing!_\"\n\nJunior's eyes filled with tears. \"Just one more nip, and I know I could\nhave relaxed enough to finish materializing.\"\n\nHeather's fascinated gaze wavered between the bottomless Junior and\nCaptain Wully's kilt. The kilt had a zipper placket exactly like a\nlady's skirt. \"I think I'm losing my mind,\" she said.\n\nJerry Masterson attempted to explain the inexplicable. He recounted\nevents of the preceding several days and concluded, \"No matter what you\nthink, you couldn't see him if you didn't believe.\"\n\n\"What about the glockenspiel?\" she asked weakly.\n\n\"That's Red Skeleton,\" said Captain Wully. \"He uses a couple\nof ball-peen hammers on his ribs. We was tunin' up to serenade\nPocahauntus.\"\n\n\"The cat,\" said Heather. \"She's left out.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, she ain't. Gertrude sings coloratura.\"\n\n\"_That_ even _I_ don't believe,\" said Jerry.\n\n\n\nJunior's upper half poised before the easel, and he flourished a brush.\n\"Just a touch about the eyes. And another here.\" He flicked at the\nmouth.\n\n\"Get away from there!\" yelled Jerry.\n\nJunior burst into tears again. \"I was only trying to help. Besides, it\ndid need--\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be....\" Jerry looked at the canvas. \"Junior was right.\"\n\n\"About Gertrude,\" insisted Captain Wully. \"If you don't believe it, why\ndon't you come serenadin' with us, you and Miss Heather?\"\n\nJerry looked inquiringly at Heather.\n\n\"I'll hate myself if I do,\" she said.\n\n\"Then we won't go.\"\n\n\"But I'll hate myself worse if I don't.\"\n\nHe called that evening to take her to the serenade, and met her family.\nMr. Higgins was very pleasant. Mrs. Higgins was very pleasant. But\nJerry was uncomfortably aware of a large photograph on the mantle.\nThe photograph was of a young man, and it was not pleasant. Its eyes\nfollowed Heather Higgins possessively. The photograph's tailored suit\nintimated its pockets were not lined with tax liens.\n\nMrs. Higgins noticed Jerry's interest. \"That's Wesley Tatom.\"\n\n\"Of the First National Bank Tatoms,\" said Mrs. Higgins.\n\n\"His great grandfather was Ephraim Tatom,\" said Mrs. Higgins.\n\nEphraim Tatom, so Jerry gathered in the next half hour, had practically\nblazed the Oregon Trail single-handed.\n\n\"Wesley is attending the State Bankers Convention right now,\" said Mr.\nHiggins.\n\nMrs. Higgins gave Jerry a meaningful look. \"We're _very_ fond of dear,\nsweet Wesley,\" she said.\n\nJerry was understandably relieved when it came time to depart.\n\nAs for the serenade, Gertrude was in fine voice. Her words were\nincomprehensible, but no more so than foreign opera. Captain Wully\npuffed through _Indian Love Call_ and a pibroch or two on the pipes,\nably assisted by Red Skeleton on the glockenspiel and Junior on the\nmouth-harp.\n\nPrincess Pocahauntus was impressed by Captain Wully's full dress. She\nfingered the flowing shoulder plaid, tsk-tsking over the fineness of\nsuch a blanket. And the silver buckles--only a big chief would possess\nsuch wealth.\n\nGertrude bristled, and Oscar, the werewolf, dashed up with a limp and\nfurry trophy, which he laid at the princess' feet.\n\n\"What's that?\" Heather gasped.\n\n\"A sidehill gouger,\" explained Pocahauntus. \"See?\"\n\n\n\nShe put the little animal upright, or as nearly upright as\ncircumstances permitted, for the gouger's left legs were three inches\nshorter than his right ones. Reaching into her reticule, she produced\na couple of artistically carved bone pegs, which she fastened to the\nabbreviated left legs. \"Prosthetics. Relics of our last gouger, who\nmigrated to Switzerland.\"\n\n\"Somebody ought to write a book,\" mused Heather.\n\n\"Lots of books have been written,\" said Pocahauntus, \"but not one from\nthe 'inside.' What we spirits need is a John Gunther. Now take the\nsubject of Lovers Leaps. More twaddle has been written about--\"\n\n\"I've done a couple of regional articles for the _Covered Wagon\nQuarterly_, but nobody wants to print my historical fiction,\" said\nHeather. \"What about Lovers Leaps?\"\n\n\"Now take my own. I was really running away from a greasy warrior. He\nchased me to the cliff edge and, in my girlish innocence, I jumped.\nWhat price virtue!\"\n\n\"Too bad _I_ wasn't around,\" mourned Captain Wully. \"I'd a-caught you.\"\n\n\"If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't jump.\" Her black eyes\nflashed, and she drew herself up regally. \"I'd push that feather-headed\nCasanova off instead.\"\n\nThen, graciously, she suggested barbecuing a salmon over the open fire,\nbut Heather was afraid it would take too long and her parents might\nworry. So she and Jerry excused themselves and left Captain Wully to\nhis courting. As Jerry walked Heather up the front steps, the scent of\nlilacs was an invitation to romance, the moon a lover's promise.\n\n\"Good night,\" said Heather. \"It's been such fun.\"\n\nHer handclasp carried a hint of finality that went beyond words, and\nJerry said, \"_Been?_\"\n\n\"Wesley gets back tomorrow.\"\n\nWithout being told, Jerry knew that Heather's portrait would have to be\nfinished from memory. Any man worthy of the name, Jerry told himself,\nwould have argued the point--unless he was broke and jobless _and_ had\na tax lien in his pocket.\n\nHe tried to work on her picture next morning, sought to imprison the\nlaughter of her eyes, the song of her lips. But then he realized that\nthe laughter was for somebody else. The song too.\n\nFrom above came a few experimental notes on the glockenspiel. Presently\nJunior's mouth harp joined in. The melody staggered uncertainly,\nfinally emerged as Mendelssohn's _Wedding March_.\n\nJerry threw down his brush and left the house. He walked toward the\nlighthouse. That once stately saltbox had already lost its lensed\ncupola and most of its siding. He watched for a long time as the Sam\nSchultz Salvage Company pried board from board and piled all in a\nstack of jack-straws. Maybe he could go to work for Sam Schultz and\nmake enough to pay off the taxes. And, if he observed all the Horatio\nAlger niceties, maybe some day he'd own the company and could seek\nHeather Higgins' hand in marriage--only to discover she had long since\nmarried Wesley.\n\nHe walked along the beach. Climbing to a jutting promontory, he watched\nwaves break against the rocks below. Why not throw himself into the\nsea? He could become a ghost, and maybe find a lady ghost, and....\n\n\n\nHe went home and forced himself to work on Heather Higgins' portrait.\nHe filled an entire sketch pad with brief line drawings of her until,\nlate at night, he finally fell asleep in his chair. He awakened to\nbroad daylight--and the whistling of the postman.\n\nThe letter was from Eloise Wright, Chairman of the Northport Art\nFestival, and concerned his canvases.\n\n    _Ellis is positively dithy-rambic! Claims you've caught a\n    hauntingly spiritual quality, and wants to buy the storm canvas\n    for his San Francisco galleries. Barret, the Chicago Barret, is\n    lyrical about the spectral lights and shadows, and is writing his\n    New York dealer about a showing. Have sold four canvases. Enclose\n    certified check--_\n\nJerry reached for a chair. Four canvases? His asking price for four\ncanvases had never come to any such figure as the check represented.\nThe letter contained a postscript.\n\n    _Barret is out of his head over \"Gertrude.\" Impressionism at its\n    finest, with an eerie, imaginative quality unsurpassed by any\n    American artist. Soul of the eternally feminine, as typified by\n    a cat with a hole in the head. Social satire in oil. Picture not\n    priced. He asks  what will you take within reason? One thousand?_\n\nJerry was sure of only one thing. He'd never painted any picture of\nGertrude. There was, however, the matter of that tube of bice green\nsqueezed in the middle, and the gamboge left capless. He ran to the\nstairwell and yelled for Captain Wully, who presently appeared.\n\n\"I have here a letter--\"\n\n\"I didn't do it,\" Captain Wully protested. \"'Twas Junior touched up the\npaintings. And 'twas Junior painted Gertrude. Me? All I did was help\nJunior dry the paint and boost your prices a wee muckle.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"By nothing at all, you might say. A zero on the end?\"\n\nJerry looked at the check. \"I feel like I've been obtaining money under\nfalse pretenses. Junior doesn't even get any credit.\"\n\n\"But he does. Every one of those paintings was signed 'J.\nMasterson-Junior.'\"\n\n\"I feel more honest about banking the check,\" said Jerry.\n\nWhen he made out his deposit slip and totaled his bank balance, Jerry\nreflected how quickly an inferiority complex can melt in financial\nsunshine. He made a brief stop at the post office, where he mailed\na check to the county assessor. He then headed straight for Heather\nHiggins' front door.\n\nShe had company.\n\n\"Glad to know you.\" Jerry acknowledged introduction to Wesley Tatom and\nstared with helpless fascination at the latter's necktie--of MacGreggor\nplaid.\n\n\"You arrived just in time to give me a little moral support,\" said\nHeather breathlessly.\n\n\"Now, Heather, we mustn't bore Masterson with our personal\ndifficulties.\"\n\n\"I've started a story about Oscar the werewolf, but Wesley thinks--\"\n\nWesley interrupted. \"I'm looking at it from a business standpoint. Some\nday I'll step into my father's shoes at the bank. And what would the\nBoard of Directors think of a bank president's wife who wrote claptrap\nabout werewolves and spare-rib glockenspiels?\"\n\n\"I doubt if they'd think anything at all--particularly if it paid\nwell,\" said Jerry, and stared at Wesley Tatom's tie. The knot had begun\nto ease gently.\n\n\"If she thinks she wants to write, why can't she stick to covered\nwagons, and--\"\n\n\"How stuffy of you!\" said Heather.\n\nWesley Tatom felt uncertainly of his tie, tightened the knot.\n\n\"As a matter of curiosity,\" Jerry addressed his rival, \"what makes you\nso sure Heather is going to marry you?\"\n\n\"It's one of those taken-for-granted matters. We've gone together\nsince--_say!_ What business is it of yours, anyway!\"\n\nNow Heather, too, was watching Wesley's necktie.\n\n\"I don't think women like to be taken for granted,\" Jerry said.\n\nOne end of the necktie became longer and longer as its opposite\nend shortened. With a final but quiet jerk, the necktie came free,\nhesitated for a moment opposite Wesley's belt buckle, then folded\nitself neatly and floated away.\n\nHeather giggled. \"Were you laughing at me?\" Wesley demanded,\n\n\"Heather,\" said Jerry, \"will you marry me?\"\n\nIn the free-for-all that followed, nobody settled anything.\n\n\n\nAll that occurred some time ago, of course. Meanwhile, what collector\nhasn't heard of J. Masterson-Junior, whose canvases are lauded for\ntheir \"other world\" quality? And, if you have children, you probably\nknow by heart the little book chronicling the fortunes and misfortunes\nof Oscar, the werewolf who fainted at the sight of blood. And there's\nHarriet, the hodag. And Gary, the stone-eating gyascutus. And Robert,\nthe sidehill gouger.\n\nRecently in print is a story of Oscar's love for Vi, the Vitiated\nVampire.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Jerry Masterson are widely respected. She writes the\nbooks. He illustrates them in his spare time. Such a delightfully zany\ncouple! Always joking about a Scottish sea captain who lives in the\nattic and is married to an Indian princess.\n\nNo wonder the Masterson children are overly imaginative--warning their\nplaymates not to sit on Gertrude, not to step on Oscar's tail. But\nall kids go through a phase like that. Only a few of them are lucky\nenough to grow up and make money out of it--lots of highly respectable\nmoney--like the Mastersons.\n\n\n\n\n",
