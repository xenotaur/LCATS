    "body": "There's an axiom in the galaxy: The more complicated the machine, the\nbigger mess it can make. Like the time the planetary computer for\nBuughabyta flipped its complete grain-futures series. The computer\nordered only 15 acres, and Buughabytians had to live for a full year off\nthe government's stored surplus--thus pounding down the surplus, forcing\nup the price, eliminating the subsidy and balancing the Buughabytian\nbudget for fifteen years--an unprecedented bit of nonsense that almost\nhad permanent effects. But a career economist with an eye for flubup and\ncomplication managed to restore balanced disorder, bringing Buughabyta\nright back to normalcy.\n\nOr like the time a matter-duplicator receiver misread OCH{3}CH{3}OH, to\nturn out a magnificently busted blonde sphygmomano-raiser with an\nHOCH{3}OH replacement, putting a strain on the loyalty of a billion\nteen-age girls dedicated to Doyle Oglevie worship. Doyle-she insisted\nshe was Doyle-he, as it took quite a while for her hormones to overcome\nthe memory of his easy, eyelash-flapping, tone-torturing microphone\nconquests. Put a strain on his wardrobe, too.\n\nNo machine, of course, can compare for complexity with any group of\nhumans who have been collected into machine-like precision of\noperation. Take one time when an Ipplinger Cultural Contact Group was\nhanded a Boswellister with V.I.P. connections and orders to put him to\nan assignment--for his maturity.\n\n\n\nBoswellister sat patiently. He squirmed emotionally up and down his\nbackbone, but he affected a disdainful appearance of patience in view of\nthe importance of his and his poppa's positions compared with the\npawn-like minusculity of the audience's.\n\nThe Blond Terror strode majestically down the aisle of the open air\nsports arena, preceded by twenty-four harem-darling dancing girls. The\norchestra wailed an oriental sinuosity of woodwinds and drums,\naccompanying the hip-twitching, nearly naked, sloe- (by benefit of\nmake-up) eyed, black-haired beauties.\n\nFifteen heavyweights, draped in leopard skins, had preceded the dancers\nto set up the Blond Terror's tub on a polar bear rug in the center of\nthe ring. A dozen luscious watercarriers had emptied their jars into the\ntub. Soap and towels, oils and perfumes, mirror and comb, were arranged\non top of a lushly ornamented box that stood by one of the corner posts.\n\nThe Blond Terror vaulted the ropes and stood in the ring, popping his\nmuscles, waiting for his handmaidens to remove the five layers of\nelaborately decorated robes that were draped over his super-manly body.\n\nBoswellister cringed slightly (inwardly), speculating that the Blond\nTerror really was a muscled man. All that man--nearly seven feet tall,\nbronzed, developed, imperious, condescending to notice just slightly the\nadulations of the women in the packed arena.\n\nThe Blond Terror stepped into the tub, carrying out his advertised boast\nof being the cleanest wrestler in the ring, a boast he was unable to\nprove with ring action through the exigencies of type-casting, for the\nBlond Terror was the villain.\n\nThe Blond Terror muscled down into the tub. He was scrubbed, then\nrinsed. He stood out onto the white fur rug and sneeringly allowed his\nhandmaidens to pat him dry and powder him down. They held up the large\nhand mirror and allowed him to view his handsomeness while his\nshort-cropped, blond curls were carefully combed.\n\n\"Now.\" Boswellister spoke the order into the lapel receiver. On the\nIpplinger starship a communications tech slapped home a switch and the\nsolido-vision circle settled over the Blond Terror's head, a halo of\nsolid light for a complex Ipplinger signal-reaction device.\n\n\"Hail Ippling!\" Boswellister shouted.\n\nBoswellister strained forward, clutching the seat arms. It had to work!\nHis equation must be right! The symbol had the proper cultural\nconnotations. It was bound to capture the audience, put them in the\nright mood of awe-struck superstitious reverence, make the revelation of\nthe great circle of the Ipplinger starship overhead a thing of\nwonderment and devotion-focus.\n\nThe Blond Terror should now look upwards, guide the eyes of the\naudience, bring them to the recognition. After all, as a Boswellister\n... and according to his great grandfather, and his poppa too....\n\nBut the Blond Terror gazed appreciatively into the mirror, smiling slyly\nat the audience.\n\nThe crowd roared its applause for the trick lighting effect. You could\ndepend on the Blond Terror. No matter how many times you'd seen his act,\nhe always managed to come up with something new. Now, for the opening of\nthe new Million Dollar Ventura Boulevard Open Air Sports Arena, the\nBlond Terror had done it again.\n\nBoswellister shouted. He pointed. He stared upwards, trying to draw the\ncrowd with his vehemence. But he couldn't capture one gaze, no matter\nwhat he did.\n\nHe poked the man seated next to him, but the surly fool snarled,\n\"Shuddup! The Hatchet Man's goin' into his act!\"\n\n\n\nBoswellister moaned. There it was, sailing in the night sky, illuminated\nwith soft etherealness to give the proper effect to these\nsuperstition-ridden people. All they had to do was glance up and accord\nto Ippling the superiority that was Ippling's, and they would be brought\ngently, delicately into galactic contact, opening out their narrow ways\ninto the broad ways of the galactic universal worlds. With Boswellister\nto lead them.\n\nBut he couldn't make the play. Not a head would tilt up. The TV cameras\nthat should be scanning the great lighted circle of the Ipplinger\nstarship had swung to the entrance, waiting for the Hatchet Man.\n\nAnd here he came, down the aisle like a bolt of Chinese lightning. He\nvaulted the ropes, leaped to the tub, overturned it and was gone back up\nthe aisle before the Blond Terror could retaliate. Bath water sopped the\npiles of robes and made a mess out of the bearskin rug; but the ring\nattendants carted everything off, removed the waterproof canvas from the\nring mat and prepared to get the match underway.\n\nThe Blond Terror paced in his corner, waving his hand mirror,\nchallenging the Hatchet Man to quick, bloody death. And every few\nmoments he'd stop to gaze admiringly into the mirror, running his hand\nalong the edge of the solid band of light, grabbing all the credit for\nIpplinger electronic science. He turned on cue to give the TV audience a\nfull-face closeup.\n\nBoswellister cursed himself for choosing the Blond Terror. That cynical,\negocentric muscle artist was too pleased with himself to have any room\nin his thoughts for proper superstitious awe, and too stupid to\nrecognize the superior science in back of the halo device.\n\n\"Remove the device,\" Boswellister ordered. There was no point in\nallowing it to stay, and that band of solid light, immovably in place on\nthe wrestler's head, made a perfect battering ram for head-butting\nmayhem.\n\nBoswellister paid no attention to the gladiators-at-mat; he left his\nseat as soon as the device was removed and walked out onto Ventura\nBoulevard. He went over his cultural equation, trying to find the flaw.\n\nIn the year he had spent on the preliminary survey, he had assessed this\ncultural equation to the last decimal point of surety. He had absolute\nfaith in these people's superstitions. He knew what to expect; but\nsomewhere the equation had been off. He should have chosen a quieter\nevent, he guessed. The audience had been too well schooled in the\nacceptance of the spectacular.\n\nWhat was needed was a more acute contrast, and suddenly he had it: the\nburlesque runway. He had watched it many times ... and there was one\ngirl, a big-bodied blonde with mild eyes.\n\nHe checked his watch and hurried his pace. It was about time for Dodie's\nturn on the runway that extended out from the front of the gambling\nhouse.\n\nWith satisfaction, Boswellister called up the memory of Dodie's peel\nact. This would be a natural, and he couldn't think why he hadn't\ndecided on it right away.\n\n\n\nIn many ways Dodie was a big girl. In clothes she could never be the\nfashion ideal, but she certainly made a good thing out of nakedness. Her\nsoft, heavy, white breasts made old men blanch and young men start to\ngrab. She was tall, with a narrow waist, flaring hips, long curvy legs\nand arms; with those big, innocent blue eyes, wearing high heels and an\nounce of flimsy, up there on the burlesque runway ... mmm ...\nBoswellister groaned.\n\nShe wouldn't date Boswellister a second time no matter what he\npromised, and his promises had included many things she'd never before\nheard of. Boswellister squirmed momentarily.\n\nIt was too bad there wasn't a better crowd. Most of the Boulevard's\nregulars were at the Arena opening, but there were a few loiterers,\nstanding along the curb, watching the free show. And all he had to do\nwas make a beginning, Boswellister felt. He was sure that everything\nwould roll by itself after that. He had faith in his superstition\nequation.\n\nDodie peeled. She seemed headed for complete nakedness at any moment,\nbut to Boswellister's surprise, the revealing costume contained more\npieces than he had remembered.\n\n\"Any moment now,\" he whispered to the solido-tech. \"Now, wait ... there\n... that should be the last piece. Settle the device around her head,\"\nhe ordered. Then he groaned and countermanded the order. He had\nremembered Dodie's details, not her act. For at the last moment she\nslipped to the wings, dropping the last swatch of lace to slide down one\nlong, white, out-thrust leg.\n\nOh, blessed Ippling! There was his ship, floating majestically overhead,\nbut no one would give it a glance. He pointed to it. These men _must_\nfollow his excited gestures and look up; but they were busy calling\nsuggestions to the line of ponies who had taken over the runway.\nBoswellister felt as if he were standing in a desert, surrounded by a\nmob of phantoms from his own imagination.\n\nThe crying voice of the gambling-house barker rode in over the clang and\nbrass of jazzy music, but he couldn't turn the tip. As soon as the\nline-girls left the over-the-sidewalk runway, the idlers moved on down\nthe street to take in the next spot's free outdoor lure show.\n\nBoswellister leaned against the wall and watched the barker wipe his\nsweat-soaked forehead. He felt kinship with the man in his failure. The\nmanager came out and talked to the barker for a moment. Boswellister\noverheard: \"Dodie didn't draw one customer. A buck ain't to be made\nthese days.\"\n\nThe barker replied, shaking his head, \"They're oversold, Marve. The\ngive-away is all they want.\"\n\nBoswellister turned away and walked towards his motel. They wanted the\ngive-away, but the glory of Ippling he had to give made no impression.\nHe felt desperate. He had to make one more try.\n\nHis family position demanded obedience from the starship officers and\ncrew. He stopped for a moment and gave a swift command into the lapel\npickup, then went on to his motel room.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, full of confidence after a good breakfast, he headed\nfor the intersection of Laurel Canyon and Ventura Boulevards. There he\nwould make his stand.\n\nThe boulevard swarmed with women shoppers. Cars and trucks roared by.\nThe spectacular signs and free lure show runways were closed down, for\nballyhoo of a different character had taken their place for the daytime.\n\nBoswellister stopped for a moment to watch a demonstrator work before a\nhuge, block-long, glittering drugstore.\n\nThe demonstrator went into his pitch:\n\n\"--money back. Now watch! Into a wet glass I pour a small amount of\nmedically tested Calsobisidine. See how the Calsobisidine clings to the\nsides of the wet glass.\"\n\nThe pitchman smiled with flawless teeth and the women smiled back at\nhim. His shoes were waxed and buffed; his hair fell in a black curl\nacross his high forehead; his gardenia dripped dew like the ones in the\nbox by his elbow. Each bottle of Calsobisidine came complete with an\nintimate smile from the pitchman, a fresh gardenia pinned on the breast\nby his clever fingers and a trial sample bottle. Just for six\nninety-five, plus tax.\n\n\"In the exact same manner, Calsobisidine clings to the lining of your\nstomach and intestines, giving positive relief from burning pain and\nacid indigestion.\"\n\nThis puzzled Boswellister, and he remarked in a voice that seemed\noverloud, \"But who has glass insides?\"\n\nThe women giggled and turned away.\n\nThe pitchman's scowl was a menace; his voice bitter: \"Go on, scram. You\nqueered my tip.\"\n\nBoswellister slipped away while the pitchman started to collect a new\ncrowd. He popped into the entrance of the drugstore, and as always stood\nmomentarily amazed by the bewildering variety of merchandise. Gardening\nimplements, paper goods, dishes and glassware, whiskey, Calsobisidine, a\nhuge display of baby dolls that performed every human function but\nreproduction....\n\nThen he gasped and walked towards the inside demonstration. There,\npresided over by a fake medical man, dressed in operating room regalia,\nincluding mask, rubber gloves and stethoscope; there, right in the\nmiddle of the block-long drugstore, a demonstration of the newest\neducational doll was taking place. The doll, stretched out on a\nminiature hospital delivery table, was being delivered of a replica\nnew-born infant.\n\nAgain and again the \"doctor\" performed the delivery, alternately\ninserting the doll-baby into the doll-mamma and removing it.\n\nBoswellister flushed and walked quickly away. He had no doubt of the\ntoy's educational value, but nevertheless--he sighed deeply.\n\nWhen Boswellister reached the corner of Ventura and Laurel Canyon, he\nmade his stand on the southeast corner, facing the hills over which the\nIpplinger starship would come to hover over the intersection and be\nrevealed by him.\n\nHe contacted control and ordered the halo focus for his head. He reached\nup and felt the circle, planted firmly over his brow. He smiled to\nhimself and went into his pitch.\n\n\n\n\"People of Earth,\" he began in a quavering voice, then he remembered the\nCalsobisidine demonstrator, firmed up his tones and started again.\n\"People of Earth! Listen to the message from the stars!\"\n\n\"Selling horoscopes,\" a woman answered her child's question.\n\n\"What's a horrorscope, mamma?\"\n\n\"A bunch of hooey,\" she snapped in reply, scowled at Boswellister and\njerked her child complainingly down the street behind her.\n\n\"People of Earth!\" Boswellister stated commandingly. He grasped a man's\narm, saying, \"Stand still a moment, friend, and hear the promise of\nIppling. Glory beyond your imagination can be yours with the ascendancy\nof Ippling in this world of tears and sorrows.\"\n\nThe man jerked away. \"What the hell, Mac!\" He looked searchingly at\nBoswellister and muttered, \"Geez, a nut.\" He stood back from\nBoswellister to listen, smilingly superior, tolerantly waiting to be\nentertained. A woman dragging a toddler stopped, then several other\npeople stopped to see until Boswellister had about ten people standing\naround him.\n\n\"People of Earth!\" he started in again, but he was interrupted by a\ncackling voice from the rear.\n\n\"Where else?\"\n\nThe small crowd laughed and started to move away, but Boswellister stood\nstraight and commanded them. \"Listen! Wait for a moment and learn your\nglorious destiny.\n\n\"Now,\" he said quietly into the lapel pickup, and the great doughnut\ncircle of the Ipplinger starship sailed in close over the hills. A line\nof brush fire followed the starship.\n\nBoswellister held up his hands and pointed. \"Behold the glory of\nIppling that can be yours!\" He held onto the halo, trying to get them to\nfollow the symbolism. \"Look upwards!\" He screamed at them, but they\nwatched the brush fire that swept the hill top. It was a goodie. It\nwould wipe out a number of homes.\n\nHe grabbed a boy by the arm and demanded, \"Look at the Ipplinger\nstarship. Behold the glory of Ippling!\"\n\nThe ten-year-old sneered. \"Yah! That's the new 1993 Lockheed X69-P37\nexperimental ship. I got a model last week.\"\n\n\"No, no, lad! The Ipplinger starship, come to Earth to bring the\nblessings of Ippling's culture to this backwards planet. Ippling will\nsave you from wars and ills, from poverty and hatred. Ippling will be\nyour destiny. Follow me, Boswellister! Ippling will lead you to the\nstars! Glory for all!\" Boswellister patted the boy on the head.\n\n\"Keep your hands off me, you big stiff!\"\n\nBoswellister gulped and pointed upwards. \"See the Ipplinger starship!\"\n\n\"Aah! Shuddup!\"\n\nHis mother jerked his arm in reproof. \"How many times I've gotta tell\nyou not to say, shuddup. Say, SHUT UP! S-H-U-T U-P!\"\n\n\"Aah!\" the boy said in disgust. \"Everybody knows starships are big\nrockets!\" He'd said the final word; he had no more interest in\nBoswellister, for the fire engines were coming.\n\n\n\nThey sirened down Ventura and turned up Laurel Canyon, their heavy\nmotors, air horns and sirens drowning out Boswellister's speech. Cars\nhad piled up at the intersection to wait for the fire engines to make\ntheir swing, and Boswellister leaped to the middle of the intersection\nas soon as the trucks had turned.\n\nHe held up his arms and went into his _People of Earth_ spiel again. But\nangry, blasting horns cut his voice to nothing. The drivers pressed\nclose in on him, pinpointing him in the middle of the intersection.\nShouts and jeers and horns; the roaring scream of fire engines; people\nrunning and shouting; Ventura at Laurel Canyon was a cacophonous\nmaelstrom.\n\nA traffic officer screeched his copcycle to a halt and made his way to\nthe center of the mass of tangled traffic. He blew his whistle and waved\nhis arms, ordering Boswellister to the sidewalk, but Boswellister\nrefused to move. He had his mission on Earth.\n\nBoswellister shouted over the piled-up noise, waving his hand to the\nsky, calling to them to follow his lead to the glory of Ippling.\n\nThe officer grabbed his coat collar and hustled him to the sidewalk.\n\"You're under arrest!\"\n\n\"You can't arrest _me_!\" Boswellister squirmed and jerked away. He\nshouted, \"Follow me!\" and ran north, a good part of the crowd after him.\nHe shrieked an order into the pickup while he ran over the bridge\ntowards Moorpark.\n\nA woman spotted the Ipplinger starship that followed overhead. \"Free\nsamples!\" she screamed, and those who had lagged behind fell into a run\nwith the crowd following Boswellister.\n\nThe northwest corner of Laurel Canyon and Moorpark had been cleared of\nhouses for the erection of a new billion-dollar shopping center, and the\nground was smooth and bare. Here, in the center of the five-acre\nconstruction site, the Ipplinger starship settled to Earth.\n\nThe Ipplinger Supreme Starship Commander was panic-stricken. He had to\nrescue Boswellister from that sample-seeking mob. If Boswellister should\nbe trampled and injured! Each screamed demand, picked up by\nBoswellister's lapel microphone, sent the Supreme Commander's blood\npressure up another notch, and the moment the ramp was unshipped he hit\nthe ground.\n\nOfficers and crewmen quickly lined up to pipe Boswellister aboard. But\nthe crowd pushed in close, forcing Boswellister to the rear as they\nscreamed for their free samples. Two bulky crewmen stood embattled by\nthe entrance port, strong-arming the kids who tried to storm through the\nport and inside.\n\n\"Space Angel's inside!\" That was their battle cry as they tried to\nwriggle under the legs of the crewmen.\n\n\"Ya sellin' Oatbombs?\" one screamed in the commander's ear, then reached\nup to snatch off a shoulder patch.\n\nBoswellister stood in the rear of the crowd and wrung his hands while\nthe crowd clamored for their samples.\n\n\"Give us the pitch, then pass out the stuff!\"\n\n\"Lookit that ship! Ain't it a dilly! Whatcha sellin', Wheatsnaps?\"\n\n\"Bring on the dames!\"\n\n\n\nThey pressed in close to the starship, running their hands over the\nslick metal surface.\n\n\"Boy, what a prop! Bet it cost a million bucks. What ya sellin',\nmister?\"\n\n\"Sanity!\" Boswellister shouted from the rear.\n\nHis men tried to hold their ranks, but the crowd broke the lines,\njerking the medals off their chests for souvenirs.\n\nBoswellister was almost babbling by the time the commander and his men\nbattled their way to him.\n\n\"You saw it all! You know!\" Boswellister protested. \"That Blond Terror\nand his harem darlings, and those violence-avid ruffians in the\naudience! Dodie, the stripper, with her lip-licking ogglers! That\nCalsobisidine pitchman, oozing allure and implied invitation! My\nequation! My precious equation, buried under a mass of pills, lotions,\ntoys, food, clothes and everything sold with a bump and grind!\"\n\nThey fought to the ship with him, while the crowd opposed each step,\nyelling for entertainment, for TV cameras, for samples of anything.\n\n\"How could I have missed it?\" Boswellister moaned. \"I should have sold\nthem with sex, right from the beginning.\"\n\n\"What do you do, handsome? Sing?\" A bundle-clutching housewife breathed\ninto his face, stepping on the commander's foot as she shoved in close\nto Boswellister.\n\n\"Take me home!\" Boswellister beseeched the commander.\n\nThe officers and crew, tattered, demedaled, bruised and completely\ndefeated in morale, formed a flying wedge and drove for the safety of\nthe ship.\n\nThe ramp retracted. The port closed, then opened briefly to eject a\nnosey boy, closing finally on the demands and the mocking laughter and\nthe clangor of arriving police cars.\n\n\"Raise ship!\" the commander ordered. He sopped at the blood from his\ngashed arm and said to his first officer, \"Somebody in that mob used a\nknife to go after those service stripes.\"\n\nThe first shuddered. \"Ugly brutes.\"\n\nBoswellister leaned against the corridor bulkhead and sighed as the\nIpplinger starship rose from the ground. How could he explain to his\npoppa? All his brothers had won their worlds. He _would_ do it. He\nsquared his shoulders. After all, he was a Boswellister. Boswellister\nXIV, no less. A son of Gaphroldshan IX himself, the Prince of Ippling\nWorld LXIV, a Royal Prince of the Central Ippling.\n\nHe walked resolutely to the control room, riding the crest of his\nrefurbished dignity.\n\n\"Put me down on that planet we spotted last year,\" he ordered. \"What was\nthat star map number?\"\n\n\"G.S.R. 285139-F. R. A. 592-105-R.U. 13,\" his alert assistant\nastronomical officer answered, reading the number from a prepared\nmemorandum.\n\nBoswellister hesitated. Should he reprimand the officer for anticipating\nhis failure or compliment him for his efficiency? Boswellister backed\nwater and went to his room to learn the language he'd need, while the\nofficers pulled their own demoralized spirits together so they could go\nto work on the crew when the news broke that they weren't going home.\n\n\n\nThey made a quick passage to their destination, and Boswellister--well\nrested, well fed, hypnotically tutored, supplied with communicators, a\nsynthesizer for his food and a portable equation writer strapped to his\nback, and his irrepressible, dauntless belief in himself in triumphant\noperation--stepped from the ramp onto this newest world of his Princely\ndestiny.\n\n\"Circle in orbit,\" he ordered. \"I'll call you when I need you.\"\n\nBoswellister walked confidently down the road to town. He congratulated\nhimself on having learned, also on his wise humility in admitting the\nfact of his having learned. He smiled now at the naivet\u00e9 with which he\nhad approached his first try at establishing a realm for his Ipplinger\nPrincedom rights.\n\nHe had been so full of illusions that he had landed openly, had stepped\nright up and announced that he had come to establish his household and\nrear his own Princes, who would, in their maturity, leave to win their\nown worlds. In addition to their being small-minded on that first world\nabout his needing five wives for his household, they had nearly managed\nto commit him to a lunatic asylum, for he had overlooked, in his\nequation, the fact that his first planet, with its two suns and\nperpetual daylight, had never known about the stars. There had been no\nway to break through their wall of stupidity, and he had left, the\nplanet's sanity-police close on his heels. Had he used money it would\nhave been a cinch, he had realized as soon as he was safely in the ship.\n\nThat hard-earned lesson he had applied to his second planet, but there\nsuperstition meant more than money, though money had seemed on the\nsurface to be the answer to everything. On that second planet he had\nmade the error of buying his way into the half-political, half-religious\ntemple setup, and had tried to bring the local superstitions into line\nwith Ipplinger Reality Philosophy. They had lost an officer and three\nmen when they rescued him from the temple's torture chamber; and none\ntoo soon, for he had been taking quite a stretching when his rescue had\narrived.\n\nApplied on Earth, the superstition equation had not paid off. He had\nfailed to notice that they didn't really believe in their religions and\nsuperstitions, though they showed every indication of being extremely\ndevout and credulous. He should have sold Earth, and sold it with sex.\n\nWell, he had learned, all right, and here, on this new world, in this\nfresh start, he would show how well he had learned. In the idiom of\nVentura Boulevard, he'd hit 'em with the whole deck, deuces wild. He'd\ngive 'em sex and money and superstition and to hell with fact and logic.\n\nThese primitive worlds had to be brought slowly into a respect for\nlogic; for Ipplinger logic, the only valid system of logic in the whole\nuniverse.\n\nIn the hovering ship, the commander turned to the astrogator and said,\nwith the bitterness of yesterday's conflict with the mutinous crew\nevident in his voice, \"Well, our little vaporized circuit is off again.\"\nHe motioned to the image of Boswellister in the forward viewscreen.\n\nIt was a sight that tended to increase the tremor in the astrogator's\nhands. He replied, \"I only hope we can pull the crew through another\npickup. Home and family! Do they think I want mine any less?\"\n\nBoswellister marched confidently down the road. He _would_ succeed, for\ndidn't he have the well oiled machinery of the whole Ipplinger starship\ncrew of cultural contact specialists to back him up?\n\n\n\nWhile he walked, he practiced the strident-voiced delivery of\nextravagant lies he had learned so well and had so magnificently\nimitated from the Ventura Boulevard pitch artists. He practiced the\nleering insinuendo of the barker outside the gambling hall; he gave it\nthe Calsobisidine con come-on; he sold it solid, dripping with sex,\ntwitching with lure.\n\nHe knew that here, finally, he would succeed.\n\nBoswellister XIV, Noble Prince of Ippling, smiled his confidence in his\nsex-money-superstition equation as he walked briskly down the road to\nbegin his contact with a world that had substituted vat-culture\nprocreation for sex; that had abolished money in favor of a complicated\nsystem of verbal, personal-honor swapping credits; that had no religions\nor superstitions. A world of people who considered the most sweetly\ndistilled essence of living to be the minute investigation of the fine\npoints of logical discourse, engaged in on the basis of an incredibly\nmultiplied logic structure composed of thirty-seven separate systems of\ndiscursive regulations, the very first of which was based on a planetary\nabsolute, the rejection and ridicule of all persuasive techniques and\nthose who used them.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
