    "body": "When the patrol found her it was impossible to say how long she had\nbeen in the humidi-hut alone. She was incoherent but, as Morrissey\nobserved, most Venusians are.\n\nNot that Selo was an ordinary Venusian woman. Even in her madness,\nas she babbled to the patrol about red dust devils and punctured\nthermiteens, there was a haunting beauty about her. Those deep-set\nviolet eyes, the blue-black hair, the shapely, well-rounded body--easy\nto understand why an earthman might be hypnotized by such a woman.\n\nAt first she was passive. Their questions made no impression upon her.\nShe nodded her head absently and gestured vaguely toward the vac-lock\nthat led to the dust-tortured world outside. Once or twice, Morrissey\nthought he heard her mutter Yancey's name but he couldn't be sure.\nHer speech was a confused mixture of English and the indecipherable\npolyglot of Venus.\n\nThe simplest solution seemed to be to take Selo back to Athens where\ntechnicians could subdue her hysteria and perhaps eventually draw the\nwhole tragic story from her paralyzed mind.\n\nMorrissey wouldn't have admitted it to any of the members of his\npatrol, but he found the woman's manner disconcerting. She stared at\nthe vac-lock as though she momentarily expected Yancey to appear there.\nSo intense was the stare that if Morrissey hadn't seen Yancey Ritter's\ndesiccated body himself, he could have believed that the woman had\nsecond sight.\n\nHer passivity was abruptly shattered when they tried to get ready for\nthe trip. She clawed and bit like a mad animal as they struggled to\nslip the plasti-shield over her shoulders.\n\n\"Let me die as Brian died!\" she wailed. \"I do not want to live without\nhim. You cannot make me live.\"\n\n\"Hey, captain,\" a panting patrolman shouted, \"what do we do with her?\"\n\n\"Put that plasti-shield on her. Tie it if you have to. She's not to go\nthrough that vac-lock without it.\"\n\nThe frenzy that had seized Selo seemed to subside as quickly as it\nbegan. She permitted them to make the plasti-shield secure. Her face,\nthrough the greenish-gray mask, had the texture and shading of a\ncorpse. Zombie-like, she had lost all individuality.\n\n\"Check your thermiteens,\" Morrissey snapped to the patrol, \"and let's\nget out of this place.\"\n\nThe men quickly filled their light-weight thermiteens with water\nfrom the supply in the humidi-hut, fastened their own plasti-shields\nsecurely over head and shoulders, put on their asbesti-mittens and\nstepped into the vac-lock.\n\nSixty seconds later, the party stood in the weird, dust-filled world\noutside. A hot wind pressed its dusty fingers against their protective\nhoods and tugged with an eerie persuasiveness at their padded jackets.\nThrough the murk an orange sun burned in the sand-strewn sky. Rocks\npitted and pocked from centuries of relentless persecution stood stark\nsentinel on every side. This was Venus.\n\nWalking slightly behind Selo, shoulders hunched, head down, Morrissey\nworried the enigma of this strange Venusian woman and the two men who\nhad known her. Two men--now both dead--wind-dried mummies fallen in the\nwastes of the Desert Rouge.\n\nVictims of the desert, Morrissey wondered, or victims of a woman with\ndeep-set violet eyes and blue-black hair.\n\n\n\nThe Earth colonies on Venus, Mars and the satellites of Jupiter are\nfilled with men like Yancey Ritter. They're men who seem to be born\nwith a weight of bitterness on their backs. They look at the Universe\nearly in life and decide that things are set against them--that they\nare the persecuted and misunderstood. You've heard them talking in bars.\n\n\"If I just had a chance I'd make it. I just never get the breaks.\"\n\nYancey Ritter said that a thousand times in his life. He said it when\nhe was prospecting for brakion on Mars, when he tried lumbering on\nEuropa, and finally, when he took the assignment to the humidi-hut on\nVenus.\n\nThat job, of course, was to be only a stepping stone. When Yancey\nwasn't preoccupied with the relatively simple routine of maintaining\nthe humidi-hut he planned to search for quollas. The edge of the Desert\nRouge, near the humidi-hut to which Yancey had been assigned, was\nreputed to be an ideal locale for such a search.\n\nThe quolla, an amazingly beautiful gem burnished to a glowing\nloveliness by the wind and sand, brought an increasingly fancy price in\nthe jewel markets of the System. A few sizeable finds and Yancey would\nhave a little capital with which to work. Given fifty thousand credits\nhe was certain that he could, in time, become one of the really big\ninvestors on Venus.\n\nSuch projects always assumed a false simplicity in Yancey's mind.\nAboard the space tramp that brought him to Athens his sudden rise to\npower and position seemed quite feasible. But when he gazed out across\nthe tortured wastes of the Desert Rouge he felt a momentary tremor of\ndoubt.\n\nSuch spasms passed quickly. Like most men of his temperament Yancey\ncompensated for the failures of past and present with roseate dreams of\nthe future. Now, it appeared, that future was at hand.\n\nThe commandant in Athens was brutally frank.\n\n\"It would appear to me, Ritter,\" he said wryly, \"that tenacity is not\none of your cardinal virtues.\"\n\nYancey cleared his throat. He was trying hard not to be impressed by\nthe commandant's office, the commandant's ribbons, the commandant's\nmanner. \"I don't know what you mean, sir.\"\n\nThe big man tapped the papers on his desk with a stubby finger.\n\"Governmental service on Earth ... mining on Mars ... lumbering on\nEuropa ... and now, an assignment on Venus. Not the record of a stable\npersonality.\"\n\nYancey was bewildered. What was the commandant saying? Wasn't he to get\nthe post? The dream of a fortune in quollas flickered. \"I--I've been\nlooking for work that would really challenge me, sir.\"\n\nThe gaze was direct. \"Challenge you. That's an interesting answer,\nRitter. So you think that assignment to a humidi-hut in the vicinity\nof the Desert Rouge will awaken your latent and heretofore unexplored\npotentials?\"\n\nWas the man laughing at him? Even in the carefully conditioned room,\nYancey felt the beads of perspiration settling on his forehead. \"If I\nwas just given a chance,\" he said, seizing on the familiar cliche. \"I\nknow I can please the commandant.\"\n\nA sigh escaped the big man. \"Pleasing me is irrelevant. Keeping that\nhumidi-hut operating is vital. Do you realize, Ritter, that since\nwe established our chain of humidi-huts on Venus we've reduced our\nmortality rate thirty per cent?\"\n\nA nod seemed to be all that was required from Yancey.\n\n\"I just want you to realize that the job you're taking can't be\nabandoned one fine morning when you're seized with a whim to go to\nSaturn.\"\n\n\"I tell you, sir, I think I've found what I want here. You needn't have\nno worries about me leaving the service.\" Yancey felt better. He was\nback on solid ground. The old man was afraid he'd leave without notice.\nThey were all alike. No matter where you went--Earth, Mars, Europa,\nVenus--employers were always worried about being left in a spot.\n\n\"Human lives depended upon your efficiency, Ritter. Earthmen can only\nendure so much of this Venusian heat and dust, then we dehydrate. It's\nup to you to see to it that your station is always alert to the needs\nof any one in your sector.\"\n\nWords--only words. Yancey's mind was far away, searching the dust of\nthe Desert Rouge for the beautiful quolla stones.\n\n\"You'll be paid three hundred credits a month and living expenses. I\nmight add, Ritter, that the station you're getting is one of the most\nimportant in the entire chain.\"\n\nThree hundred credits! And, with a little luck, Yancey thought, he\ncould find quollas worth a hundred times as much.\n\n\"There'll be a patrol to escort you to the station and I think\nyou'd better plan to leave at once.\" There was a small pause as the\ncommandant regarded Yancey closely. \"I hope,\" he said at last, \"that\nneither of us is making a mistake, Ritter.\"\n\nYancey stood up, shook hands with the commandant, and the interview was\nended.\n\n\n\nMorrissey headed the patrol which escorted Yancey to his new post.\nYancey took an almost immediate dislike to the broad-shouldered\nyoung space militiaman. There was about Morrissey that air of quiet\npositiveness which Yancey found impossible to bear.\n\nThroughout the long and tiresome march from Athens to the humidi-hut\nthis unreasoning resentment of Morrissey grew. The yielding,\ninsubstantial dust underfoot, the eye-watering furnace glare in the\nsky, the desiccating heat that seemed to dry up the marrow in a man's\nbones--all this, through some inexplicable subconscious juggling,\nbecame Morrissey's fault.\n\nInside the comparative comfort of the plasti-shield, Yancey Ritter\nlooked at the raw redness that stretched around, above and below him,\nand wondered what perverse fate had drawn him to this ultimate debacle\nhere on the dust-clouded Desert Rouge. For the first time in his life\nYancey knew the bowel-rending terror of utter desolation.\n\nThe spectre of thirst hovered in the orange and yellow dust clouds\nahead. Crazed rocks, scarred and wind-broken, leered at him like blind\nprophets wordlessly screaming their dire predictions.\n\nMorrissey was at last forced to take his thermiteen away from him. He\nsobbed and pleaded for water. He swore that his tongue was swollen\nwith thirst, that his body was dehydrated. He cursed Morrissey ... the\ndesert ... the service ... his own ill fortune. He made his will, he\nresigned from the service, he called upon God to avenge his death at\nthe sands of the heartless Morrissey. And finally, after two days on\nthe pitiless griddle of the Desert Rouge, he was half-carried through\nthe vac-lock at the humidi-hut.\n\nOnly his hatred for Morrissey made him stay. Every instinct told him to\nreturn to Athens with the patrol. Let the commandant hire some other\nfool to stay there in the midst of the desert, supplying succor for\nthose who were stupid enough to face the rigors of the hell outside.\nInstinct warned him to leave but hatred forced him to stay. The\ncontempt in Morrissey's eyes permitted him no alternative. The patrol\nleft and Yancey stayed in the humidi-hut.\n\nThe first few days were a nightmare. He seemed in a waking dream. Hour\nupon hour he simply sat and stared at the precious machinery that\nkept temperature and humidity at ideal levels. Every few minutes he\nwould half-run to check the water supply, touch the water to his lips,\nanxiously work the controls to be certain that nothing had jammed.\n\nEvery second was filled with but one preoccupation: What would happen\nif the machinery failed?\n\nBut the machinery performed in its precise and unhurried way, and from\nits dependability, he began to draw a degree of confidence. He had\nlet the orange hell outside unnerve him. One could almost think that\nparticles of the wind-driven dust had penetrated his mind and prevented\nits proper functioning.\n\nWhy should he be apprehensive? Hadn't everything worked out exactly\nas he had planned? The job was his. He had the security of three\nhundred credits a month and a perfect opportunity to search for\nquolla stones. The superior attitude of that captain--what was his\nname--Morrissey--had momentarily shaken his resolve. Now, Morrissey\nwas gone. The time for huddling inside was over. The sooner the quolla\nstones were his, the sooner he could leave the humidi-hut, make the\nsort of life he had always wanted for himself in Athens.\n\nYancey didn't take risks. The first few excursions, he made from the\nhumidi-hut were within a radius of fifty yards of his headquarters.\nGradually, as he became more accustomed to his plasti-shield, to the\nmurk of the world outside, he grew bolder and bolder. He made several\ntrips to replenish the cache of water half-way between the humidi-hut\nand Athens. He became very clever in establishing land-marks for\nhimself and he found that with practice, his endurance lengthened. He\ncould go much longer without a drink from his thermiteen and the wind\nno longer drained him of all vitality.\n\nA little more than a month after Morrissey left him at the humidi-hut,\nYancey found his first quolla stone. It wasn't a large one, and it was\nfar from perfect, but for Yancey it seemed the good omen he needed. The\nquolla stones were there to be found. With a little perseverance he\ncould make the rest of his dream come true.\n\nThe one inescapable hazard of Yancey's life was the loneliness.\nVisitors to the station were few, an occasional patrol of space\nmilitia, a prospector, or a party of geologists. The days and nights\nbetween were long and empty. Yancey would sit polishing the lone quolla\nstone he had found, wondering if he could stick it out until he had\naccumulated enough to carry out his long range scheme.\n\nOften, as he groped through the constant veil of orange dust in\nhis search for the gems, he would imagine that there was someone\nwaiting for him at the station, someone to whom he could talk of the\ndifficulties he had faced, someone who could share, perhaps, the dream\nhe held. But, when he passed through the vac-lock, there would be no\none--only the monotonous purr of the machinery.\n\nDespite this, when Yancey took the week's leave to visit Athens, he had\nno idea that he was to meet someone there--that he would not return to\nthe station alone.\n\n\n\nYou must understand the position of the Venusian women to appreciate\nthe thing that happened with Yancey and Selo.\n\nFrom the time of the first settlement, fraternization had been frowned\nupon. No one expected earthmen, twenty-six million miles from home,\nto ignore the more attractive of the Venusian women. But very few\npermanent alliances were formed. Militiamen might wink at a buxom\nbeauty, might even invite her caresses to while away a long Venusian\nnight, but with the sunrise she must return to her appointed place in\nthe scheme of things colonial.\n\nSelo was a waitress in one of the cheap Venusian restaurants that\ndotted the boundary between the old city of Athens and the new. Her\nuncle, a vicious-looking old fellow with beetling brows, broken nose\nand protruding teeth, was the proprietor of the place, and, in his\nunoccupied moments, which were many, he did what he could to make life\nmiserable for the girl.\n\nThe moment that Yancey saw her he felt a quickening of his desire. The\ngirl was young. Not more than seventeen or eighteen earth years of age,\nand despite her wretched clothes she had a distinctive kind of beauty.\nShe lived in constant fear of her uncle, doing her heavy work in the\nrestaurant with the deft but lifeless efficiency of an automaton.\n\nIt was apparent to Yancey that it was only a matter of time until\nsomeone recognized the girl's potentials and took her away. He could\nfind no reason why he shouldn't be her discoverer.\n\nShe was terribly frightened and shy at first. That an earthling should\nbe kind to her seemed beyond her comprehension. Then, once she saw\nYancey was serious in his advances, she was certain her uncle would\nfind her out and punish her.\n\nOn the fourth night of his visit to Athens, Yancey persuaded Selo to\nmeet him after the restaurant closed. When she slipped furtively out of\nthe shadows to seek haven in his arms he knew that he could not return\nto the humidi-hut alone. With this woman to care for him he could\nsearch for the quollas with new eagerness. She would put an end to the\nterrible loneliness.\n\nOf course, he told Selo nothing of what he was actually thinking. If he\nhad she would have been much too terrified to understand. He promised\nto be kind to her and to protect her from any attempt by her uncle to\npunish her. He told her briefly of the humidi-hut, of the good food,\nthe nice clothes.\n\nIn the end, however, it was not so much the good things Yancey promised\nas the bad things she had suffered which brought Selo to her decision.\nLife in the restaurant of her uncle had become unbearable. An escape\nwas offered by an earthling. Earthlings very seldom offered Venusian\nwomen such security. She promised to go with him.\n\nYancey was never sure how the commandant learned of his arrangement\nwith Selo. News travels quickly in the Earth Colony at Athens. No doubt\nthe commandant had his spies. Whatever his methods, he knew--and he\nwas displeased.\n\n\"I was beginning to think, Ritter,\" he said, \"that I was mistaken--that\nyou were going to serve us well.\"\n\nYancey hated the big man for making him feel like a small boy. \"I can't\nsee that my taking Selo with me will interfere with my work, sir,\" he\nstammered.\n\nThe Commandant snorted. \"You're making two mistakes. You're aligning\nyourself with a Venusian. And you're taking a woman to an isolated\nhumidi-hut. I can't order you not to do this, Ritter. You're within\nyour rights. But I am asking you to reconsider.\" The tone was\nsurprisingly conciliatory.\n\nYancey shook his head. \"I can't go back on my word now, sir. She's\ncounting on it, and frankly, so am I. There won't be no trouble with\nher, I can promise you that. I'll be able to do an even better job if\nI'm not so lonely out there.\"\n\nThere was a little pause before the Commandant stood and faced Ritter\nacross the desk. \"As I said, I have no authority to forbid your taking\nthe woman with you. I can quite understand that loneliness is a fearful\nthing. But I've also learned in my stay here, Ritter, that there are\nother pressures of even greater intensity.\"\n\nYancey avoided the calm gray eyes of his superior. \"You don't know\nSelo, sir. She's different.\"\n\nAnd on that note the interview was concluded.\n\n\n\nOn the nightmare trip back to the humidi-hut, Selo was sturdily\nself-reliant. In fact, on several occasions when the shifting dust made\nfooting insecure, she came to Yancey's assistance. It was Selo who\nfound the auxiliary water cache, one day's journey from the humidi-hut,\nand led Yancey to it when he had lost the trail. Nature seemed to have\nequipped Selo for the environmental hazards of the Desert Rouge.\n\nIn the early days of their life at the humidi-hut, Yancey worked\nconstantly to convince himself that things were as he had imagined\nthey would be. Certainly Selo was a tireless worker. Her only concern\nwas his comfort. Nonetheless, she was, he decided after two months, a\nwonderful servant, but no companion.\n\nHer attitude toward Yancey was depressingly similar to that she had\ntoward her uncle, the restaurant owner. This was a strange mixture of\nrespect and fear. And, at times, as he sat alone with her through an\nendless evening, it came to Yancey that there was also an element of\nhate.\n\nHe found two more small quolla stones, but Selo failed to share his\nenthusiasm for the gems. She regarded them with a stolid indifference.\nHe remembered that the Venusians placed no value on the stones.\n\nThe accumulation of the fortune in quolla stones was not moving at\nquite the pace he had imagined. The jewels, it appeared, were not to be\nfound in large quantities. They must be painfully searched out in the\nremotest, most wind-tortured sections of the Desert Rouge.\n\nSuccumbing to the usual fit of despondency, Yancey was toying with the\nnotion of abandoning the whole project--returning Selo to Athens and\ntaking a space tramp back to earth--when Brian Daniels stumbled into\nthe humidi-hut.\n\nThere had been no visitors in more than three weeks. Daily, Selo's\ndefiant passivity rankled more and more. Having abused her verbally and\nphysically for an hour on that particular day, Yancey had stormed out\ninto the murk and spent a frustrating afternoon in his futile search\nfor quollas.\n\nHe staggered back through the veil of red dust, cursing his rotten\nluck, cursing Selo, cursing Venus and the twisted destiny that\nhad brought him there. Since Venus and destiny were more or less\nimpervious, he had determined to relieve his frustration by beating\nSelo.\n\nA fine frenzy had been achieved when he stepped through the vac-lock\nand saw her. She was sitting on the floor with a stranger's head\ncradled in her lap. The stranger was making light moaning noises and\nSelo was soothing him with a little crooning sound as she forced water\nbetween his blistered lips.\n\nYancey's fine anger was lost. \"Where did he come from?\" he growled,\ntowering over Selo and the stranger.\n\n\"He is a prospector. He lost his way. Another few hours on the desert\nand he would die.\"\n\nYancey stared down at the stranger. Despite the terribly blistered\nface, the stubble of a beard, the matted hair, it was apparent that\nthis Earthman was handsome beyond the ordinary. The features were\nbeautifully modeled--eyes set wide apart, generous mouth, firm chin.\nAnd, there was also something intangible about the stranger that\ntroubled Yancey. It was an air of quiet self-possession that refused to\nbe denied even while he was in semi-coma. This was a man who had been\ngiven by nature all the qualities Yancey Ritter most prized and least\npossessed.\n\nIn the days that followed, Selo never left Brian Daniels' side. It\nwas as if all her life she had waited for someone upon whom she could\nlavish such care. She nursed him not so much out of his need as out of\nher own. Yancey's bitter, jealous remarks failed to touch her.\n\nUnder such care, Brian recovered quickly and he seemed to find in Selo\na something for which he, too, had long sought. In the few days of\nhis convalescence they achieved the sort of communion that Yancey had\ndreamed of when he had first brought Selo to the humidi-hut.\n\nYancey's conversations with Brian were brief and charged with hate.\nDaniels had been prospecting for quolla stones. He was on his way back\nto Athens and had lost his bearings. Only the humidi-hut had saved him\nfrom death. When he spoke to Yancey, he seemed always anxious to return\nto Selo, a preoccupation that only deepened the seething hatred Yancey\nhad conceived for him.\n\nMore than once, Yancey ordered Selo to keep out of Brian's way but it\nwas the same as if no words were spoken. In the unfaltering stare of\nthose deep-set eyes, Yancey read her open defiance. So desperate was\nher need for Brian that nothing short of death could keep her from him.\n\nNothing short of death.\n\n\n\nYancey viewed that possibility. Murder in such a remote place would be\neasy but what was to be gained? Selo certainly wouldn't love him more\nif he killed the prospector. Another consideration was Daniels' build.\nHe was a well-muscled man and, being fully recovered, was something\nless than the ideal murder victim.\n\nAnd then Yancey found out about the quolla stones--quite by accident.\nHe had gone out on a routine check of the vicinity and had turned back\nearlier than usual. As he stepped through the vac-lock he saw Selo and\nBrian huddled in earnest conversation. So engrossed were they, they\nfailed to hear the asthmatic wheeze of the lock. Yancey stood a long\ntime silently watching them.\n\nOn the table before the two was a glittering pile of the most beautiful\nquolla stones Yancey had ever seen. Dozens of them. A small fortune\nlying quietly on that table in the humidi-hut. Here were the black\nstones that Yancey had dreamed of finding. Here was the answer to all\nhis hopes.\n\nBut the answer lay in another man's hands, the hands that now caressed\nSelo!\n\n\"I won't be long in Athens,\" Brian was saying. \"There's at least sixty\nor seventy thousand credits worth of quolla stones there. I'll take\nwhat they'll offer me in the market, Selo, and then I'll come back for\nyou.\"\n\nThe woman pressed closer to Daniels. \"Don't leave me here even for a\nlittle while--with him.\"\n\nBrian's arms went around her. \"This is the best way, Selo. He'll make\ntrouble. It's not going to be pleasant. Let me get rid of the stones\nfirst and then you and I can start out together.\"\n\nShe buried her face in his chest. \"I'm so afraid--here alone with him.\"\n\nBrian tilted her chin up to face him. \"There's no reason to be afraid\nof him. I know his kind. He only talks about things he could do. He\nwon't hurt you. He wouldn't dare.\"\n\nThey were lost in each other's arms as Yancey turned and silently\nslipped back through the vac-lock. When he noisily re-entered a half\nhour later his plans were made.\n\nIf Brian was surprised by Yancey's sudden change in attitude, he gave\nno indication. He accepted Yancey's solicitous interest as lightly as\nhe had his surly resentment earlier.\n\nDinner, the evening before Brian was to set out for Athens, was an\nhilarious affair on the surface. Yancey insisted on toasting Brian, on\nexacting a promise that he would come back to visit them. He assured\nthe prospector that they would miss him and that he must consider the\nhumidi-hut his home when he was on Venus.\n\nBrian seemed to accept Yancey's protestations as genuine. Selo regarded\nher husband with quiet suspicion.\n\nThe next morning Yancey made all the preparations for Brian's\ndeparture. He had painstakingly drawn a detailed map of the route to\nAthens. He personally chose a new plasti-shield to protect Brian from\nthe pelting of the dust and sand. Finally he filled the two thermiteens\nwith their precious supply of water.\n\nFinishing up this last chore in the little lab which housed the water\nsupply, he smiled to himself, for he knew that Brian was using his\nabsence from the living-room to pay Selo a fond farewell.\n\nOnly as the vac-lock closed on Brian and the indicator showed them he\nhad left the humidi-hut did Yancey relax. He leaned against the door\nand smiled at Selo.\n\n\"So,\" he half-whispered, \"your lover's gone. But he promised you that\nhe'd come back for you, didn't he? Didn't he?\"\n\nFor a moment Selo met his gaze. Then, she turned and started toward the\nkitchen.\n\n\"I wouldn't leave just yet,\" he taunted. \"I wouldn't leave until you\nhear why he isn't coming back for you. Doesn't that interest you?\"\n\n\n\nShe stopped, not turning, her back rigid. \"I thought you'd change your\nmind,\" Yancey went on. \"I thought you'd like to know why you can't\ncount on seeing Mr. Brian Daniels again.\"\n\nHe laughed, and the sound was like a bad smell in the close little hut.\n\"The thermiteens are punctured,\" he giggled. \"The water your lover\nneeds is already evaporated. When he wants it, in three or four hours,\nthose thermiteens won't even be moist. He won't be able to keep on to\nthe auxiliary cache. And he won't be able to come back here.\"\n\nShe was moving toward him. \"You saw the quollas. You're killing him to\nget the jewels.\"\n\n\"That's only part of it,\" he countered savagely. \"He deserved to die\nfor many reasons.\"\n\nWith the quick grace of a Martian feline, she started to slip past him\nto the vac-lock. He caught her arm and twisted it behind her back. She\ncried out in pain, struggling with a ferocity he hadn't expected. After\na moment he succeeded in throwing her to the floor.\n\n\"You can't save him,\" he panted. \"Nothing can save him. You're going to\nsit here with me, Selo, and wait for the desert to kill your lover.\"\nAgain he laughed. \"It won't take long.\"\n\nAll that day and night they watched each other. And the time dragged\nby, Yancey's excitement increased. Selo, on the other hand, seemed to\nshrink within herself. It was almost as if in contemplating Brian's\ndeath she was dying herself.\n\nShortly after noon the next day, Yancey set out from the humidi-hut\nwith four thermiteens. Two were full of water and two were empty.\n\nHe found Brian's body a little more than an hour's walk from the\nhumidi-hut. Obviously, the prospector had discovered the punctured\nthermiteens and started back, but the desert moved in for its kill. He\nhad crawled into the shelter of a pile of twisted rock, and with the\npunctured thermiteens in one hand and the quolla stones in the other,\nhe had died.\n\nQuickly, Yancey substituted the two empty but sound thermiteens he had\nbrought with him for the tell-tale murder-tins. The quolla stones he\ndropped into the pocket of his asbesticoat.\n\nWith a final glance at the shrivelled thing that had once been Brian\nDaniels, he turned back to the humidi-hut.\n\nHe could feel Selo's eyes upon him that evening as he sat polishing the\nquolla stones. Each time he glanced up from his work she was staring at\nhim.\n\n\"Selo,\" he said at last, continuing his work with the stones, \"I hope\nyou're not thinking of revenge.\"\n\nShe made no answer.\n\n\"If you ever went to the authorities with your wild story you'd be put\nin prison for the rest of your life. I'd see to that. No one would take\nthe word of a Venusian against that of an Earthman.\"\n\nShe only stared at the floor.\n\nCarefully, he deposited the gleaming quolla stones in the chamois bag\nhe had bought for just this happy moment.\n\n\"Brian Daniels never reached this humidi-hut. Understand? Never reached\nit. We found him out there, poor fellow, but there was nothing we could\ndo for him. That's the story. Is it clear?\"\n\nHer voice seemed to come from a great distance.\n\n\"It's clear.\"\n\n\"I'm going to Athens. I'll sell these quolla stones. In good time we'll\nleave this place. We might even go to another planet. How would you\nlike that, Selo?\"\n\nEach word fell with the precision of a stone into water. \"That would be\nvery nice.\"\n\nHe rose and walked over to her. \"In time, you'll forget him.\" It was\nnot a positive statement. It was a half-question, as if Yancey were\nadmitting that this was no more than a wish on his part.\n\nSurprisingly, she nodded. \"He will be forgotten,\" she answered.\n\nThis was an unexpected victory. It so pleased Yancey that he made her\na present of one of the smaller quolla stones as a token of their new\nunderstanding.\n\nShe was very good to him that night.\n\n\n\nYancey could scarcely wait to be off the following morning. This day\nwould stand out in bold relief against all the gray, futile days of\nhis past. This was the day that would see the beginning of a new and\nhappier life for Yancey Ritter.\n\nSelo helped him make ready and listened with unusual attentiveness\nto all his instructions. He had his plasti-shield? Yes. The two\nthermiteens she had filled? Yes. The chamois bag with the quolla\nstones? Of course.\n\nShe permitted him to kiss her and then stood watching as he stepped\ntoward the vac-lock.\n\nAbruptly he turned and stood, hands on his hips, laughing at her. It\nwas a hollow, mirthless, mocking laughter.\n\n\"You fool,\" he roared. \"You stupid little fool of a woman. Did you\nthink you could kill ME--Yancey Ritter--with the same trick I used on\nDaniels? Giving me these punctured thermiteens!\" He threw them with a\ncrash at her feet and stepped threateningly toward her.\n\n\"Yancey,\" she cried, and his heavy fist caught her on the side of the\nhead and sent her sprawling to the floor.\n\n\"You don't fool me,\" he said, looking at her. \"I'm not a blind fool\nlike Daniels. This is my round to win and I won't be stopped.\" He\nturned and strode into the lab for fresh thermiteens.\n\nShe was still sprawled in the same spot when he returned. \"I'm not\nfinished with you,\" he snarled. \"We'll finish the payment when I get\nback from Athens.\"\n\nAnd with that he disappeared into the vac-lock.\n\nResolutely, he strode through the flying dust, eyes set on the orange\norb that was the sun. A slow steady gait, he had found, was the most\npractical way to cover distance in the shifting blood dust of the\nDesert Rouge.\n\nAs the morning advanced, the winds that drove the sand seemed to\nincrease in their elemental fury. The sun was all but blotted out and\nthe dust swirled and eddied in an orange and red kaleidescope. It was\nas if some giant stood and threw great fistfuls of choking sand at\nYancey.\n\nHe touched the cool water in the thermiteen to his lips often and each\ntime he drank he half-laughed aloud, remembering the disappointment on\nSelo's face when she saw her trick was discovered.\n\nHe skirted wide around the rocks where he had found Brian. No reason to\nspoil the day by a second glimpse of that grisly sight.\n\nOnce or twice it seemed to him that he was being followed but he\ndismissed the notion as nerves.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, it's Daniels' ghost. And with a harsh laugh he\ntoasted Daniels' ghost in the cool water. He toasted Selo and the\ncommandant and the quolla merchant who would soon give him a fortune\nfor the stones in the chamois bag.\n\nThe wind clawed at him with gritty fingers and his boots seemed to sink\ndeeper and deeper into the yielding dust. Every step was an effort and\nhe could feel the slow encroachment of dehydration.\n\nAt the auxiliary water cache he promised himself he would use a little\nof the water to dampen his face.\n\nHe finished the last of his water in the thermiteens about nine hours\nafter he had left the humidi-hut. He had drunk more than usual but he\ndecided that his thirst had been aggravated by the storm.\n\nThe familiar marker that stood guard over the auxiliary water supply\nloomed through the shifting murk. He half ran the last few yards,\nfeeling already the soothing coolness of the dampened cloth against his\nfevered cheek.\n\nHe stopped a few paces from the water cache and stared.\n\nThe door of the little thermi-safe stood open and there in the drifting\ndust lay the emptied auxiliary water kegs.\n\nHe threw himself to the ground and seized one of the emptied\ncontainers. The dust around it was still moist. Someone, short minutes\nago, had broken into this cache and deliberately emptied the water into\nthe dust. Someone....\n\n\"Selo!\" he half-screamed and staggered to his feet. \"Selo,\" he cried,\nand remembered his sense of being followed.\n\nWas it the wind among the tortured rocks, or did he hear a high-pitched\nwoman's laugh?\n\n\"Selo,\" he shouted, \"I didn't mean to hit you! Selo, you've got to help\nme!\"\n\nSilence.\n\nHe began to run.\n\nExhausted as he was, he must have run for nearly an hour before the\nunbearable burden of his thirst pushed him down into the granular\ncushion of the Desert Rouge. A million orange and red parasites\nclustered on his body and drew out the last drop of his vitality.\n\n\n\nMorrissey sighed and stepped closer to the Venusian woman. He felt sure\nthat the clever technicians in Athens would get no story from her.\n\nTwo accidental deaths. That would be the verdict.\n\nMorrissey took Selo's arm as she half-stumbled in the shifting dust.\n\nTwo men dead--wind-dried mummies fallen in the wastes of the Desert\nRouge.\n\nVictims of the desert? Or victims of a woman with deep-set violet eyes\nand blue-black hair?\n",
