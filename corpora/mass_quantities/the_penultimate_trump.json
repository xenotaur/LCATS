    "body": "Harley D. Haworth had been a doughty warrior in the American manner.\nMany a powerful Wall Street foe had bowed to his strength and thousands\nof innocent victims had cursed his name. But that was many a misty year\nago.\n\nNow even his son was an aged philanthropist and H.D. himself was\nrelegated almost to legend. But at ninety-two the old battler was\nlocked in his most desperate struggle, vainly trying with his failing\nstrength to beat off the grimmest, most relentless of all antagonists.\n\nIf the man in the street ever heeded or mentioned this struggle, it was\nto disinter a corny, dog-in-the-manger joke.\n\n\"Old Harley D. Haworth,\" he would say patronizingly, \"is such a guy--if\nhe can't take it with him, he just don't _go_.\"\n\nBut he was going all right, battle by battle, losing his war. Not that\nhis forces were small--two billion greenbacked stalwarts comprised his\narmy. The resources of the planet were his. Only his generals, the\nworld's fanciest physicians, were incompetent to maneuver these forces\nto advantage.\n\nThey gave him gland extracts, they gave him vitamins, they gave\nhim blood transfusions. They gave him false teeth, eyeglasses,\narch-supports. They cut out his varicose veins, his appendix, one of\nhis kidneys. And in the end the learned doctors held a conference and\nthis was the sum of their wisdom--eat crackers-and-milk.\n\nAt this juncture there was a shake-up in the high command. The new\nChief of Staff was not a physician but an engineer named Jones.\n\n\"What man can imagine, man can do.\" So runs the optimistic saw. The\nboy, Garibaldi Jones, had had firm faith in said saw, and imagined\nhimself a great lawyer and famous statesman. With the passage of time,\nhowever, there gradually came to Garibaldi, as to many another before\nand since, the suspicion whoever said that was kidding.\n\nNow Baldy Jones had long since conceded that _his_ imagination, at\nleast, far outran his capabilities. He had settled down, when he\nrealized he lacked the persuasive gift, to being a reasonably competent\nmechanical engineer.\n\nAn ordinary slip-stick jockey, that was the work-a-day\nJones. But sometimes, on a Sunday, Jones the\ngeneral-statesman-scientist-prophet-and-all-around-wiseacre would\nhold forth from his armchair on life, love, art, literature, science,\nreligion, politics and various other manifestations of nature that are\ndignified by names.\n\nOn a certain portentous Sunday in the summer of 1947, about the time\nthe doctors were prescribing crackers-and-milk as a specific for senile\ndebility, Garry had found a particularly depressing article in his\nSupplement. Goodwife Nancy was relaxed with the Women's Section.\n\nGarry wiped the perspiration from his gleaming head of skin and\nproceeded to her instruction.\n\n\"Listen, dear, it says here some scientist thinks the human race is\ngoing to be wiped out. It's too dumb to survive, or too smart. I think\nthat's crazy but he's got a lot of points. Listen, he says--\n\n\"'To date there has been no indication whatever of any barrier to the\nindefinite extension of the frontiers of science. It is breath-taking\nto think what this means. It means that so far as we know the\nscientific method is capable of carrying humanity to any conceivable\nheights and beyond.'\"\n\n\"Garry, stop talking so loud and let me read this, 'Fun With\nFish--Hints for the Hurried Housewife.' You're always saying, 'Give me\nsomething different.' Science. What do I know about science?\"\n\n\"You should know something beyond the kitchen. Listen--'But reflection\nturns hope to alarm, with this thought--In the vast and ancient\nuniverse surely some races must have had time already to attain godlike\npower and yet they have not manifested themselves. Many answers are\noffered to this riddle, but none very satisfactory.'\"\n\n\"Garry, will you be quiet?\"\n\n\n\nNancy's question was sharp. \"I will not,\" said Garry. \"'One answer\nis that our civilization is very young, and the hypothetical\nsuper-civilization somewhere just hasn't found us yet. But that is a\ncontradiction in terms, because it takes most of the \"super\" out of the\nsuper-civilization, considering that a technological culture advances\non an exponential curve.'\"\n\n\"Garry, are you going to let me read in peace?\"\n\n\"I am not,\" said Garry. \"'Another is that a super-civilization would\nhave advanced beyond any concern about us or our petty problems. This\nis an uneasy possibility, but rather thin for this reason--\n\n\"'From all indications our mastery of the physical world is proceeding\nmuch faster than our mental evolution, and while this condition may\nchange I am inclined to think we would be flitting about the galaxy\nbefore we would have lost our humanity.'\"\n\n\"Garibaldi Jones, if you don't stop with that crazy stuff I'll go out\nof my _mind_!\"\n\n\"You will not,\" said Garry remorselessly. \"'We are thus led to the\nproposition that there is no super-civilization and to the corollary\nthat intelligence, at least technological intelligence, has no survival\nvalue. This is a sobering thought, and we ask--\n\n\"'Why? Aside from metaphysical hypotheses vain to pursue, there is one\noutstanding answer. Someone, someday, will find a chain reaction for\none of the light elements like oxygen and silicon, or perhaps some\nother even deadlier agent will be loosed upon the world--for as science\nprogresses more and more power is more and more often concentrated in\nfewer and fewer hands.'\"\n\n\"Garry, do you intend to _ever_ stop talking?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said Garry. \"'There is, sadly, no indication of an\nabatement of the spirit of irresponsibility that has kept the world,\nespecially in recent years, in turmoil, at war or in fear of war.\n\n\"'The only real remedy, perhaps, is fear of God, but the materialist\nknows that when he dies his rotting carcass is beyond punishment,\nbeyond hope, beyond recall. Thus the only restraint on beastliness is\nthe ineffectual one of conscience, and in consequence--'\"\n\n\"_Why_ beyond recall?\" interrupted Nancy, surprisingly.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Well, if science can do anything, like he says, why can't they\nbring the dead people back some day? Now you just read that tripe to\nyourself, if that 'scientist' knew anything he wouldn't have to write\nfor trashy Sunday Supplements, and let me read in peace, _do you hear\nme_?\"\n\n\"How can I help it?\" muttered Garry, who had already conceived the germ\nof a notion.\n\nThe notion grew into an idea, and the idea hardened into a resolve.\nAnd in the natural course of events he went to H.D. Haworth with his\nproposition and there was a meeting of minds.\n\nBut a third talent was needed for their project, and the logical\ncandidate was Ellsworth Stevens, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nThe seduction of Ellsworth Stevens made a temporary stir in certain\nlofty circles, shocking all but the most cynical.\n\nA brilliant bio-chemist, a few months previously Stevens had reported\nsome attempts at suspending animation in mammals by a method involving\npreliminary partial dehydration of the living tissue through\nstarvation, followed by freezing.\n\nThe technique exploited the newly-discovered tendency of very minute\nquantities of radioactive phosphorus in certain phospholipids to\ncounteract the degenerative anti-gelation effect of low temperatures on\nthe colloidal phases of protoplasm.\n\nHe had not succeeded in reviving any of the animals, since none of\nthe nerve tissue had lived through the freezing, but results had\nbeen nonetheless promising. Now Stevens was employed by the Cancer\nInstitute, consecrated to this most important work.\n\nUntil one evening a Tempter called at his modest home. His name, of\ncourse, was Jones.\n\n\"Dr. Stevens,\" said Garry, \"I want you to quit your job and go back to\nwork on suspended animation.\"\n\nStevens blinked rapidly behind his bifocals and smiled deprecatingly.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Jones, I could hardly do that. You see, I've been doing some\nwork with radioactive tracers and I'm beginning to get significant\nresults. Can't very well quit now, can I? That other matter isn't very\nimportant--I hardly think it could be done, anyway.\"\n\n\"Dr. Stevens,\" said Garry, \"the Cancer Institute doesn't pay you very\nmuch. You have a daughter who is getting to the age where she would\nlike to be dressed up. I will give you a ten year contract at ten\nthousand dollars a years.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jones, do you realize that cancer is responsible for more deaths\nthan any other ailment except heart disease? Maybe I sound sentimental\nbut I actually think of myself as taking an important part in the\nworld's greatest crusade.\"\n\n\"Dr. Stevens, I will give you a ten year contract at one hundred\nthousand dollars a year.\"\n\nBlankness in the shy, blinking eyes, then mounting anger. \"Look, you,\nwho the heck d'you think you're kidding? If you--\"\n\n\"Dr. Stevens,\" Garry said hastily--an enraged sheep is an appalling\nspectacle--\"I have a power of attorney from Harley D. Haworth.\"\nEllsworth Stevens gaped like a fish, and was pure no more.\n\n\n\nThe Pacific lay stagnant, having decided it was too hot a day to do\nanything except evaporate. But there was the suggestion of a breeze\nin the garden and ample shade for three men. The dried-up little old\nman was speaking, and the big bald man and the lean bespectacled man\nlistened with respectful attention.\n\n\"I'm a hard-headed business man, and I'm not easy to fool, as many\na smart-aleck's learned, hrumph! It would surprise you the number\nof quacks that try to sell me miracle water and yoga systems and\nsuch-like. Blasted parasites!\n\n\"But I know a good investment when I see one,\" the thin, complaining\nvoice went on, \"and you gentlemen have a sound idea.\" He paused\nbenevolently to let them look gratified.\n\n_This is ridiculous_, thought Gary, _the old boy's a caricature._\n\n\"A sound idea--don't depend on these pill-rolling fools that call\nthemselves doctors nowadays to keep you hanging around a year or two\nmore, but just go to sleep in a nice refrigerator until people _really_\nknow something about the body.\" He shook a bony forefinger.\n\n\"And they'll do it, too. I don't believe in much, but I believe in\nscience. It will take a lot of money, but that's what I've got. And\nyou can have all you need, Mr. Jones, all you need, as I've told you\nbefore. Blank check. You came to the right man when you came to H.D.\nHaworth.\" He sank back into his nylon deck chair, exhausted by the long\nspeech.\n\nGarry seized the opportunity to air some of his ideas. He was all\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"We'll put the vault in Michigan, Mr. Haworth, not here in\nCalifornia--too many earthquakes. Might be a long time before they know\nenough about bio-chemistry to revive a dead man and restore his youth.\nNot that you'll be dead,\" he amended hastily, \"just in a state of\nsuspended animation. I'm sure Dr. Stevens can work _that_ out.\n\n\"Anyway, we'd better put the vault in Michigan--very safe country,\ngeologically. We'll make the vault and the coolers of the very best,\nof course, granite and stainless steel and quartz that will never wear\nout. And then,\" he added, coyly, \"I have a little idea for a power\nplant that will be really _dependable_, if I _am_ the one that says it.\"\n\n\"It better be!\" snapped H.D., suddenly ferocious.\n\n\"Yes--of course. There's the problem of keeping everything secret but\nI'm sure we can manage it. The workers won't know what they're doing,\nDr. Stevens, and I can do all the really technical work. And there'll\nbe only one trustee each generation to keep his eye on things, starting\nwith me.\"\n\nStevens was leaning forward, wearing a somewhat bewildered expression.\n\n\"But I thought--but surely after we demonstrate that suspended\nanimation is feasible and we've verified our results, we'll publish?\"\nSeeing the odd-faces the other two were pulling, he repeated\nplaintively, \"I always publish.\"\n\nH.D. Haworth pronounced a certain four-letter word. Garibaldi\nJones cast his eyes to the heavens and tore his hair, coming away\nempty-handed, of course.\n\n\"Well, what's wrong with that?\" Stevens snapped, a little color in his\nface. \"Don't the people have a right to know?\"\n\n\"Young man,\" quavered H.D., tottering to his feet and shaking the bony\nforefinger, \"what you know about people I could stick in my--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, Mr. Haworth,\" Garry soothed. \"Let me explain to Dr.\nStevens how it is. Please don't excite yourself. Remember,\" he coaxed,\n\"we don't want a heart attack _now_, do we?\" The old man collapsed into\nhis chair with a feeble curse.\n\n\"Look, Ellsworth, old man,\" Garry said kindly. \"The last thing in\nthe world we want to do is keep anything from humanity. _You_ know\nMr. Haworth is the biggest philanthropist in the world. But in this\ncase--well, it's dangerous.\n\n\"What do you think would happen if people found out a few rich men were\nsleeping in quartz coolers while they had nothing but mouldy graves to\nlook forward to? Why, man, they'd tear our vault down with their bare\nhands!\"\n\nH.D. was nodding, muttering something about blasted riff-raff, but\nGarry saw Stevens' look of contempt.\n\n\"But that's not the main thing,\" he said hastily. \"It wouldn't be good\nfor the country--in fact the world couldn't stand it. Once people were\nconvinced, everybody would demand a frigidaire instead of a coffin.\nNot many could be made and people would plot and steal and kill to get\ntheirs and religious people would fight against it.\n\n\"There'd be fakers and stock promotions all over. The nation's economy\nwould be wrecked. People would take their money with them or leave it\nas savings at compound interest while they slept for a few centuries.\nThink of the harm it would do, man--think of the people who are happy\nnow, whose lives would be embittered with vain hopes!\"\n\n\n\nHaworth's head was bobbing on his scrawny neck. \"That's right, young\nfellow, and that ain't the half of it!\" He cackled. \"Almost like to get\na finger in that pie myself.\n\n\"The insurance companies would be the ones for it, of course.\nTwenty-year endowment and, instead of paying you, they pickle you. But\nit's too risky, too risky--you see that, don't you, my boy?\"\n\nStevens sighed unhappily. \"I suppose so,\" he said, defeated.\n\n\"Good, good!\" Garry boomed, rubbing his hands briskly. \"I knew Dr.\nStevens would see the point. He has a head on his shoulders.\n\n\"Now, as I was saying, Mr. Haworth, we'll have space in the vault\nfor a hundred or so. That should be enough, I think, but we'll rush\nyours through first, of course, and have it ready in jig time, just in\n_case_.... And after that....\"\n\nAnd so their plans were laid and something new was born under that sun\nwhich shone with such ridiculous indiscrimination on H.D. Haworth and\non the common people.\n\nAccording to the outline sketched that afternoon, the vault was\nto be safeguarded and the sleepers' interests looked after by the\nestablishment of a Haworth Trust, with Garibaldi Jones the first\nAdministrator. Only one person in each generation, the Administrator,\nwould know all about the vault.\n\nOf each generation the Administrator and one or two of his closest\nrelatives would join the ranks of the sleepers. The Administrator's\nresponsibilities and discretion would include all measures necessary\nfor the safety of the sleepers and the trust funds would be ample, to\nallow for unforeseen future contingencies.\n\nA number of experimental animals closely duplicating H.D.'s condition\nwould be included for the future biologists first to try their skill\non--because if Stevens should not perfect a practicable method of\nsuspending animation in time, and H.D. should actually die, his\nresuscitation would be a ticklish matter.\n\nH.D. did not want to wake up blind, for instance, or with an altered\npersonality--although Stevens, for one, thought _any_ change in the\nold pirate's personality would be a step in the right direction.\nThe blasted Washington administration wouldn't let a citizen buy\nradioactives without a lot of busybody questions, but Garry had an idea\nfor a reliable source of power for the coolers.\n\nAn improvement on the new \"heat pumps,\" his design dispensed entirely\nwith moving parts, providing a large safety factor. Successfully\nreversing the refrigeration cycle, the device utilized the heat\npotential between sub-frost level ground and surface to produce power,\nusing buried coils of a common refrigerant gas.\n\nCaches of treasure were to be tucked away in unlikely places, the key\nto their location securely hidden in H.D.'s mind. No Tut-ankh-amen he,\nto invite grave-robbers by foolish ostentation.\n\nAnd so it came to pass, and H.D.'s last months, despite the physical\npain his increasing debilitation caused him, were light-hearted ones.\n\nHe was sustained by the bubbling knowledge that he tottered down life's\nhighway toward--not that great, silent abyss that the common folk's\nimagination called Heaven or Hell and peopled with childish gods and\ndemons anxiously waiting to take him to task for his many \"sins\"--but\nmerely a bend in the road beyond which lay unknown, but surely\nfriendly, lands.\n\nIn course of time Harley D. Haworth was carefully laid away in his\nice-cold \"coffin,\" and those who read the obituaries did not suspect\nthat he was the first of men to die a qualified death.\n\n\n\nHe lay on his back, staring at the white ceiling--it had not occurred\nto him yet to move. His unco\u00c3\u00b6rdinated muscles left his face blank but\nhe was frowning mentally. There was something he wanted to remember,\nsomething....\n\nHe struggled laboriously to pin down those elusive shapes, but the\n_words_ wouldn't come. It's hard to think when the words won't come.\nHis eyes sharpened their focus a little and he perceived that he was in\n_bed_. _Hospital_, he thought clearly, _I'm in a hospital, of course._\n\nHe felt more and more secure now and, after a moment's relaxation,\ntried again to remember.\n\nA man's voice said clearly, \"What am I?\"\n\nA feminine voice said pleasantly, \"You're a man, and your name is\nHaworth. Feeling all right?\"\n\nThousands of little relays clicked in H.D.'s brain and he sat up\nquickly. This room was white and windowless, but it was not the vault\nin Michigan--and that tall, clear-eyed brownette with the grave eyes\nand tender lips was certainly not Dr. Stevens.\n\nThe man's voice said, \"I guess so,\" and this time H.D. realized that\n_he_ had spoken. The blood rushed to his head and pounded in his ears,\nfor it had been a strong, _young_ voice.\n\nHe ripped away the sheet that covered him, careless of his nakedness,\nand it was true.\n\nThese limbs were firmly rounded, the smooth skin pink with the warm\nblood coursing beneath. His wildest hopes were realized. He snatched\nthe mirror smilingly proffered him and there it was, that face of youth\nonce lost to faded photographs! Then a great wave swept in with a\nrush, a roar, a dazzling sparkle of spray.\n\nHe emerged from his faint to find the head of his bed elevated, the\nwoman in white holding his wrist to count his pulse. _Well, this is\nit_, H.D. thought jubilantly, _it actually panned out. I did it, I did\nit!_\n\nNow to plunge into the great adventure--millions of questions to ask,\nmillions of things to do--a new world to conquer. H.D. rubbed his hands\nbriskly together in his habitual getting-down-to-business gesture.\n\nLoosing his hand, the brownette looked up from her watch. Her eyes were\ndark blue, and....\n\nBells rang in the back of H.D.'s head, his skin tingled and he forgot\nwhat he wanted to say. Her faint, sweet perfume was in his nostrils; a\nlong-forgotten stimulus performed its ancient function. Being a direct\nman by nature and training, H.D. decided that the shortest distance\nbetween two points was to seize this delicious creature. Without more\nado he lunged.\n\nBut she had stepped back, shaking her head and smiling reprovingly, and\nH.D. almost fell out of bed. He recovered and collected himself, and\nlaughed to show that he was a good sport.\n\n\"Oh, well, more important things to think of now, anyway--or _are_\nthere more important things? Well, get me some clothes and call the\nhead man around here, and I'll look you up later, Miss....\"\n\n\"Lorraine, _Dr._ Lorraine. I'll get you some pajamas--here they\nare--and you won't see the Supervisor unless you show some pretty\nunusual symptoms. He's a busy man and I'm a married woman.\"\n\nH.D. sputtered.\n\n\"Now really, Mr. Haworth, I'm not just being mean. You have to stay\nhere under observation for three days as a final check before you're\nsent to--well, and the supervisor doesn't speak English anyway. I'm the\nonly one here at the hospital that does, which is why I'm here. Now\nthere'll be some nice lunch for you in a few minutes, so relax like a\ngood boy and--\"\n\nH.D. exploded. \"Young woman,\" he shouted, \"_Doctor_ young woman, as you\nvalue your job, I demand to see the person in charge!\" He practically\nfoamed. \"Boy indeed! I am Harley D. Haworth and I am ninety-four years\nold--and then some,\" he added thoughtfully.\n\n\"Three hundred and twenty years in the vault and two years we've been\nworking on you,\" Dr. Lorraine said helpfully.\n\n\"Eh? Yes. Well, get me--\"\n\n\"No,\" she said very firmly. \"You've had enough excitement for the first\ntime in so long. When you've had a nice lunch and a nice nap I'll talk\nto you again, although you won't really find out very much until you go\nto--\"\n\nA door had opened and shut, and a huge male orderly came in pushing a\nmetal cabinet. The orderly and Dr. Lorraine exchanged a few words that\nH.D. could identify with no language, although the sounds were easy and\nmusical--a little like Hawaiian, perhaps.\n\n\"What's that?\" H.D. asked suspiciously. \"Where are we?\"\n\n\"Why, we're in Chicago. Oh, the language--Hominine, we call it. It\nwas adopted only about fifty years after you died, at the time of the\nUnion, when the U.S. sort of took over the world and a universal\nlanguage became necessary.\" The orderly had gone out, and she set a\ndish before H.D. on a sliding bed-tray. \"Here, eat your lunch while\nit's hot.\"\n\nH.D. let out a yelp. \"Lunch! A plate of soup! Woman, I'm hungry!\nHaven't had a bite for three hundred twenty-two years!\"\n\n\"That's just why you must go easy for a bit. Here's your spoon. Now,\ndoesn't it smell good?\"\n\nIt did, and H.D. grumblingly took some. It tasted good, too--beefy--and\nhe went at it. Between slurps he tried to get a little more\ninformation. \"You say the U.S. conquered the world fifty years after I\ndied?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! Just absorbed it, you might say. You had something to do with\nthat in a way.\"\n\n\"Eh? How's that?\"\n\n\"Well, your idea of putting yourself on ice to wait for better times\ngradually got around and, after awhile, it got pretty common in the\nStates. The insurance companies did most of it. But they couldn't do it\nin Europe, being, _you_ know, bureaucratic and half decayed and all,\nand so poor from all the wars. Couldn't afford it. Guess I'm not much\nof a historian.\"\n\nSnort from H.D.\n\n\"Oh, eat your soup! Well, it got hard for the European leaders to\nkeep their people satisfied with their poverty but there were still\nplenty of ugly things here they could point to. Then Farbenstein came\nalong with his Probe, and the Constitution was amended to adopt the\nAscension Code--and a lot of things changed.\"\n\n\n\nBy this time H.D. had finished his soup, and Dr. Lorraine took his\nplate away and flipped the switch above him that lowered the head of\nhis bed. H.D. objected testily.\n\n\"I don't _want_ to lie down! Quit that, will you. What about this\nconfounded Code?\"\n\nThe doctor shook her head. \"Sorry, it's time for your nap now.\"\n\n\"_Nap!_ Are you out of your mind? Millions of questions! I'm not the\nleast bit sleepy!\" This was a lie. There must have been something in\nthe soup, because his eyelids were becoming very, very heavy.\n\n\"Well, you can't argue with a woman,\" he complained peevishly. \"Who\never heard of a woman doctor--a pretty woman doctor...?\"\n\nDr. Lorraine did something to a lever, and the room darkened.\n\nH.D. awoke refreshed and full of vigor, the conversation with Dr.\nLorraine fresh and clear in his mind. He jumped out of bed, and\nstumbled, cursing, around in the dark until he finally figured out\nwhere the light would be.\n\nHe pushed a lever above the head of his bed, the first of several in a\npanel, and light filled the room, varying in strength with the position\nof the lever. He did not see the source.\n\nThe room was unremarkable in appearance, although he could not identify\nthe smooth, creamy, _soft_ material of the walls. Of two doors the\nouter, to his cursing disgust, was locked. The other opened into a\nRube Goldberg bathroom. After admiring the array of buttons, switches,\ncranes and slings, after a little cautious experimentation, H.D. saw\nthat the design was intended to permit cripples the luxury of a real\nbath and toilet.\n\nWandering back into the bedroom, he idly fiddled with the other levers\nin the wall panel with no perceptible results until the last. Then the\nentire end wall vanished and he was looking at Chicago.\n\nAt where Chicago should have been, at any rate--he could hardly have\nsaid what he expected but what he saw was merely a jungle. From what\nseemed a considerable height he could make out little detail in the\nmass of growing things.\n\nHe could see no other tall buildings, but he was looking toward the\nlake and his view was limited. As he strained his eyes he could see a\nlittle of bright winding paths, and graceful little houses buried in\ngreenery and blossom. No movement caught his eye.\n\nThese people must conduct their business elsewhere, he\nthought--underground, perhaps, leaving the surface for leisure and\nrecreation. Garden City indeed! Life must be pleasant here--and it\nwould soon be his! He fairly itched to make his mark on this Brave New\nWorld.\n\nHe turned from his contemplation when he heard the door open. There was\nthat woman, smiling and inquiring how he'd slept. He'd soon straighten\nher out.\n\n\"Dr. Lorraine,\" he said grimly, \"why was I locked in?\"\n\nThe smile faded just a little. \"Three days observation, remember?\"\n\nH.D. was patient. \"Look,\" he said carefully, \"I don't think you quite\nunderstand. I'm H.D. Haworth. From the little you've said I gather\nthere's been no Bolshevik revolution, common sense be praised, so the\nHaworth Trust must be worth hundreds of millions. You still use money,\ndon't you?\"\n\nShe nodded slowly.\n\n\"And I have millions hidden away where no one can ever find them but\nmyself--don't think I came an empty-handed beggar, even if something\nhappened to the Trust funds. Millions, I tell you--gold and jewels,\nrare old books and art, everything of value.\n\n\"And besides that I'm the oldest sleeper--what's the matter with you\npeople?\" he demanded fretfully: \"Don't you know what news is? Why am I\nmet by one insignificant woman doctor?\"\n\nDr. Lorraine did not seem put out by the upbraiding and this in itself\nwas subtly exasperating. It was her attitude, her air, in which\nhe sensed--sympathy, yes, and a sort of embarrassment. He did not\nunderstand it but it was absolutely offensive!\n\n\"Well,\" H.D. snarled, beside himself, \"confound it, woman, say\nsomething!\"\n\n\"Three days observation,\" said Dr. Lorraine, almost stupidly. Then she\nvisibly readjusted the mantle of her professional cheerfulness and\nspoke briskly.\n\n\"It won't be so bad. I'll be making tests every day and that will pass\nthe time and you can play the 'visor.\" She went over to his bedside\ntable and pulled out the drawer holding the instrument.\n\n\"I hate radios,\" H.D. said sullenly. \"I'd like to jam every one down\nMarconi's throat, first breaking the tubes. Confounded trashy programs,\nchanging every five minutes!\"\n\n\"Is that how they were? How awful for you! See, you just dial, like\nthis, and one station has nothing but dance music, another nothing but\nJimmurian dissonances. See? Anything you like.\n\n\"And if you first dial \"0\" you can then dial for any number or any\nentire program that's ever been recorded. Here's the index. Too bad we\ndon't have one in English.\"\n\nH.D. yielded a snicker. \"Where's the screen?\" he asked, slightly\nmollified.\n\n\"Oh. I did say 'visor,' didn't I? Well, you see, this is a modified\nvisor. No visual, no talking programs, just music. It's too bad, in\na way, but we had to have you here for some of the tests. This is a\nneuro-psychiatric ward, you see. Yes, soft walls and all. It can be\nstripped down for violents.\"\n\nH.D. showed signs of becoming that way himself and the doctor smilingly\nstepped to the door and opened it.\n\n\"See you tomorrow.\"\n\n\"_Wait!_\" H.D. roared. \"What happens then? What--\"\n\n\"Three days observation.\" She nodded, and the door was closing. He\nreached it in a bound but the lock clicked first.\n\n\n\nLate in the afternoon of the third of those maddening days that\nloathsome woman--the part of her that wasn't phonograph must have been\nclam--brought him some clothes. And the word that she spoke as she\nquietly left was music--Goodby.\n\nHe vaguely remarked the clothes as he pulled them on--socks, thin-soled\nshoes, a loosely draped one-piece garment of a closely woven sky-blue\nmaterial resembling silk but duller--a light cape of darker blue. Just\nas he was appraising the quite satisfactory effect in the wall mirror a\nsound turned him toward the door.\n\nThey stood a little awkwardly in the doorway, pulling rather solemn\nfaces. The black-haired man, who would have been big by ordinary\nstandards, was mopping his red face in a nervous gesture and the\nseven-foot giant who dwarfed him was stroking his platinum-blond beard.\n\nH.D. stared at the giant gape-mouthed. _He looks exactly like God, if\nGod were in the shape of a man_, he thought.\n\nTeeth flashed in a smile through the silvery brush and God said,\nhaltingly, \"Hello, Grampaw.\"\n\nH.D. started violently. The black-haired man came forward with a\njovial, if forced, laugh and a deprecating wave of the hand.\n\n\"You _are_ his grandfather, you know, Mr. Haworth. Fourteen times\nremoved, that is. He's the Administrator now. Don't you know me? Guess\nthe bird looks different with all this plumage, eh?\"\n\nThere was, at that, something familiar about this coarse, good-natured\nfellow, something....\n\n\"Jones!\" It was the delighted cry of a homesick sailor sighting the old\nchurch steeple.\n\n\"Garibaldi Jones! It's good to see you, man! When did they dig you up?\"\n\n\"About twenty years ago.\" Garry grinned.\n\nFor a moment H.D. thought he discerned in his grin a trace of that\nexpression he had so come to hate in the last three days, that tinge of\nsomething like embarrassment. Nonsense!\n\nHe rushed on, \"Now I'll find out about this new-fangled world and\npretty soon we'll set 'er by the ears. Once I get my....\"\n\nThe giant said something to Jones, who nodded uncomfortably. H.D.\nfrowned.\n\n\"What's that? Why don't you speak English, Mr.--uh--Mr. Haworth? I\nguess you're a Haworth?\" The giant smiled politely.\n\n\"He don't know any English, Mr. Haworth, except those words I taught\nhim. Guess you might as well call him Junior--same name as yours. He\nsays we better get going. Have to be in Washington by six. Your flyer's\nwaiting.\"\n\n_Your flyer!_ This was more like it. Well, after all, he was H.D.\nHaworth, and they named demigods after him! In the exuberance of the\nthought he forgot to ask why they had to go to Washington. He swirled\nhis cape about him and strode out. The demigod stepped aside for him.\n\nThe corridor was a surprise. It was not merely long--it was shockingly\nlong. It must have been _miles_ long. And it was broad. A truck could\nhave easily passed and it was lined with doors and little signs in a\nwavy lettering. No one seemed to be about.\n\nThey hurried along, H.D. gawking to all sides, almost trotting as\nJunior set the pace. At the great double door of an elevator shaft\nJunior touched the signal button.\n\nBig--everything around here was _big_! The elevator could have\naccommodated several pianos and the pretty red-head operating the lift\nhad to look down at H.D. She winked and made a laughing remark.\n\n\"She says you're cute.\"\n\nH.D. did not know whether to be pleased or offended and before he could\ndecide the acceleration took his breath away. They went up, up, a\nridiculous distance, and at last he stepped out into another corridor.\n\n_Corridor!_ The floor must have been forty yards across and most of it\nwas moving, a series of horizontal escalators with three speeds in each\ndirection, adjacent strips moving at different speeds.\n\n\n\nWhile H.D. stared, Junior and Garry Jones had stepped aboard the\nnearest strip and were moving away. Now Jones came trotting back,\nmaking little headway against the conveyor's motion. He had to chuckle.\n\n_In my country, said the queen, you have to run like the devil to stay\nin the same place._\n\n\"Come on, Mr. Haworth,\" Garry called. H.D. waited for the next opening\nin the rail to oppose him, took hold and stepped on. When he had come\nup, Garry explained, \"This is Chicago--this building--this is the whole\ncity, the business part, that is. This is one of the transport levels.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" The place didn't look right--too bare, too empty. \"Where are the\nstores? Where are the signs? Where are the people?\"\n\n\"Stores? Oh, this is just a garage. Working day's over. Just about\neverybody's gone home.\"\n\n\"Garage?\"\n\n\"Sure, for flyers--remember? Here we are.\"\n\nThe door Junior unlocked let them into a space sufficiently garage-like\nin its bareness, but the thirty feet of gold-and-crystal grace it\nsheltered was a thing of beauty, enough to warm the cockles of any\nlimousine-lover's heart. As H.D. gave himself up to the upholstery's\ncaress he felt his old confidence return.\n\nThe wall rolled away as Junior made some unperceived signal. With the\nslightest of vibration the flyer wafted out into the shadowed evening.\nAs the wingless craft emerged into space H.D.'s hands instinctively\ntightened their grip on the arms of his chair. Then he relaxed with a\nsmile. He looked around with appreciation, ready to accept each new\nthrill with easy complacency.\n\nWhen the mounting flyer finally cleared the shadow of that Everest of\na building they must have been six thousand feet up. In the western\ndistance the dipping sun shed its fire on a doll's garden of patched\ngreen, with here and there a spot of cheerful early autumn color.\n_Charming_, he thought patronizingly, _charming!_\n\n\"Let's go down closer and have a good look at those suburbs,\" he\nexclaimed on sudden impulse.\n\nGarry shook his head. \"Too late. We'd never make it to Washington by\nsix.\" The flyer was gaining speed and altitude.\n\n\"What's all this about Washington? What happens there?\"\n\nGarry hesitated. \"You have to take a trip, Mr. Haworth.\"\n\nH.D. leaned forward, unable to hear the last words. With their mounting\nspeed the whine of violated air was becoming a scream. Garry reached\nback over Junior's shoulder and hit a toggle at the right end of the\ninstrument board. It was like shutting off a radio.\n\nHe repeated, \"You have to take a trip, Mr. Haworth.\"\n\n\"Trip. By heaven, you're as mysterious as that woman. Why don't you\nspeak up? Well, never mind that.\" His eyes narrowed. \"To whom does this\nairship belong?\"\n\nGarry sighed. \"To you, Mr. Haworth.\"\n\n\"Tell that oaf to turn around and go back.\"\n\nGarry sighed again and shook his head. \"He won't, Mr. Haworth.\" The\nflyer was arching through a dark swirling cumulus layer, still gaining\nspeed.\n\nH.D.'s jaw set hard. He gritted his words.\n\n\"I don't know just what this is,\" he said slowly, \"but I know this. You\nwon't get away with it. Nobody fools with me. I'll break you and that\ngreat goon of a great-great-grandson. Money still counts here--that\nwoman said so.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Yes. I suppose you know to whom the Haworth Trust reverts now?\"\n\n\"To you, Mr. Haworth.\"\n\n\"Yes. And that means I'm one of the richest men in the world again.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nH.D.'s cold tone deepened. \"What do you mean, no?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, times have changed, you might say.\"\n\n\"Inflation!\" H.D. exploded.\n\n\"No, sir, none to speak of. You can still get a loaf of bread for a\nquarter. It's just that the growth curve is pretty steep, and it gets\nsteeper all the time. Atomic energy, you know, and no wars for a long\ntime, and now no natural death.\n\n\"You can get twelve percent on your money in a savings bank. It's\nreally an expanding economy. Why, Chicago alone is worth more in\ndollars and cents than all the nations of earth in our time.\"\n\nH.D. reflected this. \"Well, how much is the Trust worth?\"\n\n\n\nGarry exchanged a few words with Junior. \"About thirty million, he\nsays.\"\n\n\"_What!_\"\n\n\"Well,\" Garry hastened, \"I know it isn't much for twenty million to\ngrow to after all this time, but there have been expenses! What we\nhad to spend for protection in the old days, when the mobs wanted to\ndynamite the vault!\n\n\"The sums that were spent on research to revive you! And then the\nAdministrator, Junior here, has to live up to the Haworth name and\nthat's expensive. He draws over a million a year.\"\n\n\"Why, that thieving, white-whiskered pip-squeak, I'll sue him within an\ninch of his life! I'll--\"\n\n\"Now, now, Mr. Haworth, you're still a wealthy man.\"\n\nH.D. glared. \"Wealthy. Yes. And famous. The oldest Sleeper. Can't\nunderstand why the newsmen haven't been after me. In my time--\"\n\n\"You're not news, sir. Look, Mr. Haworth, I have some rather unpleasant\nthings to tell you. I've been shirking it but I might as well tell you\nnow.\"\n\nH.D. shrugged off a faint twinge of apprehension and leaned back in his\nseat. He looked out. The flyer was rocketing through clear air, high\nabove a sea of crimson cotton, no longer accelerating.\n\nHe relaxed and permitted himself a smile. He had life, health, and\nmillions. The billions would come easily enough. Pah, what \"unpleasant\nthings\" could mar this paradise?\n\n\"You did have some news value as the oldest and one of the deadest\nSleepers--but you've been thoroughly Probed out this last year.\"\n\nH.D. frowned impatiently. \"What's this 'Probe' business? That woman\nmentioned it, and some 'Code'.\"\n\n\"The Farbenstein Probe,\" Garry said, looking thoughtfully out at the\ndarkling horizon, \"is, in simple terms, a hypno-bio-physical technique\nfor reaching and interpreting buried memories. Your thoughts and\nexperiences are on file and the newsworthy ones have been published.\"\n\nH.D.'s mind refused to accept this horrible thought. He stared stupidly.\n\n\"_No!_ It can't be!\" he gasped. \"It's--it isn't possible! It isn't\n_decent_!\"\n\n\"Oh, not _all_ your thoughts,\" he explained quickly. \"Just--well, I'd\nbetter just tell you as well as I can about the Code.\" A very uneasy\nfeeling mounted in H.D.'s breast as Garry continued.\n\n\"The Ascension Code made some basic changes in the conditions of\nlife. What it really did was take most of the irresponsibility out of\npeople's behavior. Because the freezatoria gave people hope that had no\nfaith in Heaven--so the Code gave them fear, that didn't fear God. The\nCode put justice on a remorseless eye-for-an-eye basis.\"\n\nH.D.'s blood ran slowly cold. He repressed the thought, denied it,\nrejected it, but in his heart he knew. His intuition had made the\nconnection. Garry noted his heavy breathing, and felt a stir of pity.\nHe continued, gazing out.\n\n\"It's simple enough, in practise. Every fifty years each person\nmust submit to a Survey--and all Sleepers when they're revived.\nBy association techniques they're made, under the Probe, to admit\neverything they've done that was wrong, either by their own conscience\nor by the written law.\n\n\"Then--well, you see--one outgrowth of the Probe is that _suffering_\nhas been classified, qualitatively and quantitatively. Oh, it's\narbitrary on the edges, but not very, and where there's doubt there's\ncharity, of course.\n\n\"After the Survey, if he's passed a certain allowable maximum in\nwrongdoing, a person must go to--the penal colony and experience\nhimself all the suffering he has caused, qualitatively and\nquantitatively as closely as possible.\"\n\nThe question was only a whisper. \"How long will I have to spend at\nthis--this place--where did you say?\"\n\n\"The penal colony? It's on the fourth planet. I guess we used to call\nit Mars.\" He hesitated. \"In your case, I'm afraid--well, they say you\nhurt a lot of people.\"\n\n\"It's ridiculous!\" H.D. cried desperately. \"It's barbaric! My word,\neven in our time reasonable people knew that _revenge_ isn't\ncivilized, even against _criminals_. Can't they _rehabilitate_ people?\"\n\nGarry grimaced, and spoke flatly, slowly.\n\n\"'There is no known deterrent from harmfully selfish action except fear\nof punishment. Nor can there be a healthy mind as long as there exists\na debt to conscience.' That's a translation from a schoolbook.\"\n\nH.D. sprawled in his chair like a poled ox. He recognized that he was\nbeaten. His eyes stared vacantly, he mumbled over and over, \"They\ncan't, they can't.\" He did not notice the flyer's swooping deceleration.\n\n\n\nSomething was shining with a white light. They were hovering. H.D.\nlooked up absently, little interest in his eyes. A great long\ncave-mouth yawned in the mountain that was Washington, bright in the\ngathering dusk.\n\n\"There's our signal.\" A green eye was blinking rapidly. Junior settled\nthe flyer in a curbed rectangle and H.D. had a moment to note the rows\nof craft, the conveyors, the rows of brightly lettered doors in the\nbackground. Then the door of the flyer opened and a gray-uniformed man\nalmost as big as Junior clambered in, carrying a little leather bag.\n\nH.D. watched in silence as the Administrator and the stranger exchanged\na few words and some sheaves of paper, to which each affixed a\nsignature. Then the man in gray opened his bag and, with the tools he\ntook out, began to do something to the flyer's instrument panel. He\nwhistled as he worked, a jazzy dance tune, and the sound grotesquely\naccentuated the silence of the watching three.\n\nJones stirred. \"Well, here's where we get off, I guess.\" He stepped\ndown out of the flyer, Junior after him, but when H.D. mechanically\nfollowed, the Administrator's bulk blocked the door. He was smiling\nwith polite embarrassment.\n\n\"Move, you oaf!\" H.D. snapped.\n\n\"Sorry, Mr. Haworth,\" Garry said. \"You're going on to ... the penal\ncolony.\"\n\nRed rage gripped H.D.; they were treating him like an animal, sending\nhim off like a bull to the packing house. He gripped the door-frame\nwith his hands, and in a quick motion set his foot against Junior's\nchest. The giant sprawled backwards, and there was a satisfying thump\nas his head struck the pavement.\n\nAn iron hand gripped H.D.'s shoulder. The uniformed man's face was\ncompletely indifferent, almost bored. He merely held H.D. until he\nrelaxed and sank shaking into a seat. Junior was on his feet, rubbing\nhis head, the oafish smile a little rueful now.\n\nThe man in gray resumed his work and his whistling. It was intolerable.\nThose two with their sympathetic silence, and this fellow with his\ncheerful, loathsome whistling. He had to say something.\n\n\"How's a little can like this able to get to another planet?\"\n\n\"Oh, we're pretty good engineers these days,\" Garry said eagerly. \"Tell\nyou about it sometime. Well, the J-man's fixing your pilot signal now.\nIt'll fly on automatic. It ought to be pretty interesting, really, your\nfirst space trip and all.\"\n\nH.D. scarcely heard him. The \"J-man\" had put his tools back in their\nbag and was descending to the pavement. The door closed with a ringing\nsound and the J-man was doing something to it from the outside.\nDespairing, frustrated tears welled in H.D.'s eyes. His knuckles\nwhitened.\n\nA faint vibration stirred in the flyer and H.D. looked around in panic.\nGoing already? He felt horribly afraid. He had an impulse to claw the\nwalls. Garry caught his wild look and returned a glance of sympathy.\nHis lips moved, but no sound came. H.D. stared. Garry's lips moved\nagain, and he gestured. H.D. remembered then and hit the toggle.\n\n\"... easy, Mr. Haworth.\" Garry's voice was as clear now as though he\nspoke beside him.\n\nThe flyer lifted gently and eased around in a 180-degree turn. The\nlast tints of evening glowed in the western sky, the earth was lost in\ndarkness and the first insolent stars were mocking him.\n\nGarry, on the other side now, called again.\n\n\"Take it as it comes, Mr. Haworth. It won't last forever, even if it\nseems like it. Son of a gun--said the wrong thing again, didn't I!\"\n\nH.D. screamed, \"Appeal! Appeal the case!\"\n\nGarry sadly shook his head. \"'There is no known deterrent from\nharmfully selfish action except fear of punishment. Nor can there be a\nhealthy mind as long as there exists a debt to conscience.'\"\n\nThe flyer was easing out into the night, toward that red star of evil.\n\n\"You say Mars isn't called Mars any more?\" he called hoarsely, pressing\ndesperately against the hard crystal.\n\n\"No,\" Garry called softly and the quiet words were still very clear.\n\"Now they call it Hell.\"\n",
