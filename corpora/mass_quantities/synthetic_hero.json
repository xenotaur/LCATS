    "body": "Every day people travel great distances to stand in silence before the\nstatue at Southwestern Spaceport. It is a shrine.\n\nThe figure stands with arms raised in an upreaching, yearning gesture\nthat invokes thoughts of man's potential greatness, and the face\nseen beneath the helmet wears an expression of inspired nobility\nand idealism. In the indestructible impervium alloy image that is\nhis masterpiece, Hayden Brush successfully captured the spirit of\nenthusiasm and adulation which swept the world. In a strange way it is\nnot so much a statue of an individual as of an idea, for the sculptor\nworked entirely from photographs taken with a telephoto lens. He never\nmet his subject.\n\nA plaque on the granite base carries numerous words--sacrifice for the\nGreater Good--advancement of Man's frontiers--conquest of disease and\ndeath. And a name, George Carlin. Whenever I read that I recall the\nancient witticism about this history being the fabric of accepted lies.\nIn it there is much truth.\n\nOn the moon is another shrine, unvisited because the surface of Luna\nis still a perilous and inhospitable place. No compelling work of art\nis to be found there. Nothing but a roughly circular blasted area\ncontaining scattered fragments of spaceship hull that scorch in the\ndirect sunlight and freeze in the unrelieved darkness, riddled by\ncolonies of creeping moon-lice that penetrate the toughest metal.\n\nThat is the real, the veritable shrine.\n\n\n\nThe idea of building a spaceship did not enter George Carlin's\nmind until after he contracted the dread--and at that time\nincurable--Matson's Disease. And then he thought of it only as the most\nspectacular form of suicide ever devised. That was typical of the man.\n\nGeorge Carlin, owner of Carlin Industries and indubitably the richest\nand worst spoiled individual on the North American continent, was an\nirresponsible egocentric who had never done anyone a good turn in all\nhis thirty-six years of life. Bad turns he had done in plenty.\n\nTake just this one example. A doctor had the effrontery to submit to\na medical journal an article suggesting a possible connection between\nthe bone-destroying virus infection called Matson's Disease and\nCarlin Industries' highly profitable operations in thawing Antarctic\nareas with atomic heat. He hinted that age-old spores might have been\nreleased from the melting ice, and been carried to seaports.\n\nCarlin's private intelligence operatives got wind of the article before\npublication, and Carlin himself ordered that measures be taken. The\ncampaign was short and filthy, ending with the unfortunate doctor\ndiscredited and barred from practice on framed evidence. The article\nwas not printed.\n\nAnd then came a morning when George Carlin noticed a slight soreness in\nhis ribs and his fingers detected a peculiar flexibility. For a while\nhe could not believe it. Such things just did not happen to him. To\nothers perhaps, but he was above them. For he was George Carlin.\n\nBut when the symptoms not only persisted but increased he was at last\nforced to a realization of doom. Gradually his bones would soften\nand dissolve, until in a year or two he would be a mere lump of\nquivering flesh without a skeleton to give it shape. He did not tell\nhis physician. That was useless, for the atypical plague had defied\nall efforts of medical science. Instead he reacted in characteristic\nfashion by getting grossly and disgustingly drunk.\n\nDuring the hangover he decided upon suicide. There was nothing unique\nabout this; thousands upon thousands of victims had taken the short\nroad rather than helplessly endure the horrors of the final stages. But\nmere suicide was not enough for George Carlin. He was not just anybody.\nHe was different.\n\nWith his money it had always been easier to arrange spectacular\ngestures than to force himself through the hard work necessary for\nmore constructive achievements, and the substitutes had been just as\nsatisfying to his ego. This habit of thought persisted even in planning\nhis own death.\n\nVerne Harris was an obscure junior engineer at one of Carlin\nIndustries' minor branch plants. A confidential report rated him as\nextremely brilliant and original, although somewhat visionary and\ninclined to overlook commercial possibilities. His very obscurity\nwas one of the reasons he was placed in charge of constructing the\nspaceship. He could be handled, and the impression would be given in\nall publicity releases that George Carlin himself was the moving force.\n\nCarlin was annoyed at their first personal interview. Harris appeared\nfascinated by the technical problems presented and insufficiently\nimpressed by George himself. Carlin felt slighted, but Harris possessed\nthe ability. The only stipulations upon which Carlin insisted were that\nwork be rushed and that all major arrangements should be made through\nhim personally. It pleased him to keep the reins in his own hands.\n\nAnd so the spaceship went into design and then production, with all\nother projects of Carlin Industries postponed or cancelled outright.\nNothing, absolutely nothing, was allowed to interfere, and money was no\nobject.\n\nOnce Harris recommended that three particular specialists be hired to\nwork on the navigation equipment. When Carlin discovered that the men\nwere under exclusive contract to American Calculator Company, which did\nnot wish to release them, he issued orders backed by eighty million\ndollars. When the flurry of reorganization was over he owned majority\ncontrol of American Calculator and took revenge for the slight delay\nby instituting policies that soon forced the other directors into\nbankruptcy.\n\nSeven months later the ship lay in its launching rack on the Arizona\ndesert. It was sleek and relatively small, built to carry a single man\nand fuel for a one-way trip to the moon, with oxygen and supplies to\nlast five weeks. Harris had performed miracles of design, including\nseveral intricate devices intended to insure a not-too-rough landing,\nand in the nose compartment was stored a huge folding reflector and\nhigh-intensity light which could be set up and operated from the ship's\nelectron-displacement power packs. Trajectory and power settings had\nbeen worked out and set up in the automatic control equipment.\n\nThe ship was intended to land in the dark of the moon, as Harris had\ncalculated it would be easier to generate heat than to dissipate it on\nan airless surface.\n\nHarris tried to explain to Carlin why he had not used the almost\nunlimited power of nuclear fission in the driving rockets. No shield\nagainst the deadly radiations had been devised and a human would have\nlived less than five minutes. But Carlin had not been interested. He\nlacked a technical education, and he was quite content that the ship\nwas incapable of a round trip. It was more spectacular that way.\n\nThere had been a tremendous barrage of publicity throughout the\nconstruction period, but all of it dealt with Carlin Industries or\nGeorge Carlin himself. Not a single public mention of Verne Harris had\nbeen made.\n\nCarlin had spent those seven months alternating between prolonged\ndrinking bouts and periods of flogging his organization to ever\nmore frantic activity. Anything to avoid thinking. And it required\nincreasingly clever and time-consuming use of cosmetics to hide the\nprogress of his disease. Concealment was a compulsive psychological\nnecessity, for Matson's Disease was so common, so plebian, that he\nfelt deeply ashamed. More and more he insisted upon being entirely\nalone, afraid his secret might be discovered, conducting his affairs by\ntelephone and radio.\n\n\n\nThen one evening, with the ship awaiting only final loading, Harris\ndrove over from the technicians' camp to the luxurious desert villa\nwhich Carlin had caused to be built near the launching site. The two\nmen had come face to face only half a dozen times.\n\nIt was a thinner, older-looking Verne Harris than the young engineer\nwho had accepted the assignment with such enthusiasm, and the haggard\nlines in his face showed the almost inhuman lengths to which he had\ndriven himself.\n\n\"Arrangements for the liquid oxygen are complete and I'll be ready to\nblast off next Tuesday morning, right on schedule,\" the engineer opened\nthe interview. \"I came over to thank you for the wonderful opportunity\nyou are giving me, and I promise you, sir, that I shall make the most\nof it.\"\n\nCarlin came out of his chair with a roar.\n\n\"You don't think _you_ are going to take that ship out?\" he bellowed.\n\nVerne looked profoundly shocked. No words had passed between them about\nwho was to handle the vessel and Harris had assumed unquestioningly it\nwould be he. It was only logical. Carlin had been smart enough to let\nhim think that way, knowing that thus he would receive Harris' greatest\nefforts.\n\n\"Then who is?\" the engineer asked.\n\n\"Me. I'll take it myself. That's why I had it built.\"\n\nHarris looked incredulous. \"But why?\"\n\nCarlin did not believe he owed him any explanation--he was receiving a\nfair salary--but something, perhaps a couple of drinks, made him speak.\n\n\"The ship is my way out,\" he said. \"A way by which I shall be\nremembered. I have Matson's Disease.\"\n\nIf he had expected sympathy he was disappointed.\n\n\"So have I,\" Harris announced. \"Can't you see?\"\n\nCarlin could, now that his attention was called to it. That subtle\nsoftening of the lines....\n\nA flush spread across Harris' hollowed cheeks and his eyes took on an\nalmost maniacal glitter.\n\n\"Look here, you. To you this is just a great big childish show-off\ntrick. Like those people who hesitate and draw a big crowd before\njumping from some tall building. And it will accomplish just about as\nmuch. You'll either louse up the controls and crash, or else you'll\nhave enough liquor aboard to stay in a drunken stupor until your oxygen\nruns out.\"\n\nCarlin, livid at those outrageously disrespectful words, tried to break\nin as Harris continued in mingled pleading and fury.\n\n\"My God, man, don't you see what this means? This is the first\nspaceship ever built without scrimping and cutting expenses. This one\nwill reach the moon _without crashing_. Why do you think I had it\nequipped with all sorts of scientific instruments? And why do you think\nI put so much thought into that light-flash communicator?\"\n\nA thought came to him. \"Good Lord, you probably don't even know Morse!\"\nhe said disgustedly.\n\nCarlin spluttered.\n\n\"I had planned a definite program of investigation,\" Harris continued.\n\"Physical studies of the moon's surface, astronomical observations\nwithout atmospheric interference, collection of experimental data that\ncould forward the progress of space-flight by at least a century. And\nyou, an untrained individual who knows nothing but money, would throw\naway that chance merely to satisfy your ego!\"\n\nCarlin looked thoughtful and made a few remarks about reconsidering the\nmatter. He could be extremely sly and devious when that would gain his\nends, and Verne Harris was completely taken in.\n\nBut Carlin was taking no chances on having his show spoiled by some\npipsqueak engineer he could buy and sell ten thousand times over. It\nwas easy enough, with his money and influence, to have Harris adjudged\ninsane and quietly committed to an asylum. The matter was attended to\nthe next morning.\n\nCarlin spent the night before blast-off alone in his desert villa. He\nhad given orders not to be disturbed under any circumstances, so he was\nnot informed that Harris had escaped. And he had enough drinks during\nthe evening to miss the sound of a window catch being jimmied and the\ntiptoeing footsteps behind him.\n\nOnly when the hypodermic needle plunged into the muscles of his neck\ndid he know anything was amiss, and then it was too late.\n\n\n\nHe awoke five days later in a hot and dingy furnished room in a nearby\ncity. His clothes were strange, cheap, and did not fit. In his pockets\nwas a large roll of money--and nothing else. Even the signet ring had\nbeen removed from his finger. He was ravenously hungry, and after a\nperiod of indecision he went out in search of a restaurant.\n\nLess than a block away he passed a newsstand.\n\n\"CARLIN LANDS ON MOON!\" the headlines screamed. Almost the entire front\npage was devoted to the story, and several inside pages recounted in\ngreatest detail how George Carlin had come out to his ship alone, his\nbody taped and encased in a bulky pressure suit, mumbled a \"no comment\"\nwhich had produced a deeper impression than any elaborate speech, waved\nonce to the huge throng that had gathered, and then left Earth in a\nblast of flame while every telescope in the hemisphere swiveled to\nfollow his flight.\n\nGeorge Carlin walked into a liquor store and pointed to a very superior\nbrand of whisky. \"Give me a bottle. No, make it two.\"\n\nThen he went back to the room in which he had awakened. He had no place\nelse to go. For the hundredth time he searched himself for some proof\nof identity, and for the hundredth time found nothing. For hours he sat\nwith his head in his hands, trying to think of something to do. Finally\nhe opened the second bottle.\n\nNext day the headlines read, \"CARLIN REPORTS LIFE ON MOON.\"\n\nGeorge Carlin had no cosmetics with which to hide the increasingly\nvisible ravages of his illness. He bought a supply of food as well as\nliquor and did not emerge for another six days. Thus he missed the\nperiod in which the world waited with bated breath for further news\nfrom the moon. It was during this time that a spontaneous wave of mass\nemotion swept the world and George Carlin became a hero. The grasping,\nevil deeds of the organization he headed--and they were numerous--were\nforgotten. No publicity staff could have produced such a reaction.\n\n\"CARLIN BELIEVES DISCOVERED CURE FOR MATSON'S DISEASE!\" The newspapers\nbrought out their largest type and public acceptance verged on hysteria.\n\nReports from the moon were carefully condensed, for the power available\nfrom the electron-displacement packs was strictly limited and every\nflicker of light must be made to count. Carlin did not even sign his\nname but all the world knew who he was.\n\nThe story, as pieced out and expanded by the news services, was this:\nOn the moon Carlin had found creatures resembling the terrestrial\nlouse. They looked like insects but they were of an entirely different\nchemical structure and their metabolism was suited to their airless\nsurroundings. Their food was apparently any metal or ore.\n\nWhile he was engaged in setting up the reflector, working in darkness\nand terrible cold, one of these tiny creatures had climbed the leg of\nthe pioneer's armored suit and punctured it, eating its way through the\nmetal shell and rubberized fabric liner. Only hasty application of an\nemergency patch had prevented disaster from loss of air.\n\nThe man had run to the shelter of his ship, but before he could remove\nhis armor the alien creature had bitten him on the upper leg. There had\nbeen excruciating pain from the venom the thing injected, and a large\nulcer had since developed.\n\nBut, the dots and dashes reported, the course of Matson's Disease had\nbeen not only arrested but reversed. His bones were hardening again.\nPerhaps under proper conditions the venom might....\n\nIt was the first hint that the pioneer had been suffering from the\ndeadly plague, and public sympathy and fascination multiplied.\n\nGeorge Carlin bought more whisky.\n\nTwo days later the light on the moon winked again. A rough analysis of\nmoon-louse venom showed it to be a complex pseudo-protein, with silicon\nsubstituting for carbon and chlorine for oxygen.\n\nThere followed a series of recommendations that set the press and radio\nof the world completely wild. There was almost no questioning of the\nwisdom of the voice from the moon, only acceptance and enthusiasm that\nswept aside all hesitation.\n\nWithin hours the leading governments of Earth had pooled their\nresources in one gigantic effort. The officers of Carlin Industries\naccepted the message as a command from the owner and all personnel who\nhad had anything to do with construction of the first spaceship were\nassigned to supervisory and coordinating positions.\n\nFifteen spaceships were to be built at top speed, and each was to carry\nto the moon as much excess fuel as it could lift. There all fuel would\nbe transferred to one ship, which would return with a supply of living\nmoon-lice.\n\nThousands of welders were at work on the plates of a huge, hermetically\nsealed laboratory building, while an army of machinists prepared the\nvacuum pumps and huge refrigerating machines that would reproduce lunar\nconditions for the alien creatures, and special laboratory equipment\nwas being assembled.\n\nBut George Carlin knew little of all this.\n\n\n\nOne more message flashed from the moon. The pioneer was dying. His\nMatson's Disease had been cured but the ulcer was spreading into vital\nareas. However, he suggested, tiny doses of diluted venom, administered\nover a long period of time, might....\n\nThe message ended in the middle of a word as through their telescopes\nastronomers saw a great flare go up from the moon's surface, a thousand\ntimes brighter than the communications light.\n\nThe explanation was self-evident. Electron-displacement power packs\nwere treacherous. When their stored power reached a certain minimum\nlevel they became highly explosive. The pioneer had sacrificed his\nremaining days of life to transmit vital information to the world which\nhad given him birth.\n\nEverything stopped for a day and night as the entire civilized world\nwent into deepest mourning for the man who had died 238,840 miles\naway--everything but work on the fleet of spaceships. That did not\neven falter.\n\nGeorge Carlin gave up his rented room, bought a car, and drove across\ncountry to the Midwestern city housing the headquarters of Carlin\nIndustries.\n\nHe did not get past the outer offices. Carlin Industries had been\nforced long before to develop a system for handling cranks and\ncrackpots, and it operated only too well. Matson's Disease had made\nsuch changes in Carlin's features that he was not recognized. At last\nhe was forcibly ejected.\n\nThat was his final effort. He had become a nonentity, a nobody, and so\nhe wanted only to die. But with his identity he had lost his nerve. He\ndid, however, have enough money to avoid drawing even one sober breath.\n\nIt is history how nine rockets reached the moon, transferred their\nremaining fuel, and one finally returned bearing a cargo of living\nmoon-lice as a gift beyond all price. The frantic medical campaign,\nduring which two thousand victims of Matson's Disease had their deaths\nhastened as doctors sought the proper dosage, is also history.\n\nBut then there was a cure--and another--and still more. The treatment\nbecame standardized as means were found for stabilizing the venom and\ncontrolling its potency. The government assumed charge, and every\ncitizen afflicted with the plague was not only entitled to treatment\nbut compelled to take it.\n\nWhen the health officers found George Carlin in his isolated cabin he\nwas almost dead. His skeleton had softened to such an extent that he\ncould not stand, and could crawl across the dirty, littered floor only\nwith the greatest difficulty. His atrophied muscles had almost nothing\nagainst which to work, and malnutrition and alcoholism complicated the\ncase.\n\nAfter six months in a sanitarium bed he had recovered enough to\nbecome bored. He borrowed a book from the man in the next bed and was\ndisappointed to find it an advanced treatise on rocket fuels. But he\nread it through and surprised himself by becoming interested.\n\nStill flat on his back, unable to move, he began an intensive course\nof study. He had been so nearly boneless when admitted, one of the most\nadvanced cases to survive, that the complete cure took three and a half\nyears.\n\nWhen he was finally released he had learned enough to obtain a minor\njob as technical assistant--under an assumed name--in the Carlin\nInstitute For Research which had replaced the old Carlin Industries.\nHe has been there fourteen years now, trying to compensate for lack of\nbrilliance by earnest effort and long hours.\n\nHe still has one dream. He hopes some day to stand on a barren, airless\nspot marked by twisted fragments of a spaceship. And he hopes Verne\nHarris' spirit still hovers there to hear his apologies.\n\nHe has long since given up trying to have his story believed. The myth\nis too deeply embedded in the public consciousness, and no one has ever\nheard of Verne Harris. Even the history books teach the children that\nGeorge Carlin was the first man to reach the moon alive. The last time\nhe attempted to tell the truth he was excoriated as an evil-minded\nmuckracker, probably insane, and received a fractured nose at the hands\nof an irate listener for maligning a world hero. So he has surrendered\nto the inevitable.\n\nHow do I know all this?\n\nOnce I was George Carlin.\n",
