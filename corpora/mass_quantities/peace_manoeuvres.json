    "body": "The scout stood where three roads cut three green tunnels in the pine\nwoods, and met at his feet. Above his head an aged sign-post pointed\nimpartially to East Carver, South Carver, and Carver Centre, and left\nthe choice to him.\n\nThe scout scowled and bit nervously at his gauntlet. The choice was\ndifficult, and there was no one with whom he could take counsel. The\nthree sun-shot roads lay empty, and the other scouts, who, with him,\nhad left the main column at sunrise, he had ordered back. They were to\nreport that on the right flank, so far, at least, as Middleboro, there\nwas no sign of the enemy. What lay beyond, it now was his duty to\ndiscover. The three empty roads spread before him like a picture\npuzzle, smiling at his predicament. Whichever one he followed left two\nunguarded. Should he creep upon for choice Carver Centre, the enemy,\nmasked by a mile of fir trees, might advance from Carver or South\nCarver, and obviously he could not follow three roads at the same time.\nHe considered the better strategy would be to wait where he was,\nwhere the three roads met, and allow the enemy himself to disclose his\nposition. To the scout this course was most distasteful. He assured\nhimself that this was so because, while it were the safer course, it\nwasted time and lacked initiative. But in his heart he knew that was not\nthe reason, and to his heart his head answered that when one\u2019s country\nis at war, when fields and fire-sides are trampled by the iron heels\nof the invader, a scout should act not according to the dictates of\nhis heart, but in the service of his native land. In the case of this\nparticular patriot, the man and scout were at odds. As one of the\nBicycle Squad of the Boston Corps of Cadets, the scout knew what, at\nthis momentous crisis in her history, the commonwealth of Massachusetts\ndemanded of him. It was that he sit tight and wait for the hated\nforeigners from New York City, New Jersey, and Connecticut to show\nthemselves. But the man knew, and had known for several years, that\non the road to Carver was the summer home of one Beatrice Farrar. As\nPrivate Lathrop it was no part of his duty to know that. As a man and\na lover, and a rejected lover at that, he could not think of anything\nelse. Struggling between love and duty the scout basely decided to leave\nthe momentous question to chance. In the front tire of his bicycle was\na puncture, temporarily effaced by a plug. Laying the bicycle on the\nground, Lathrop spun the front wheel swiftly.\n\n\u201cIf,\u201d he decided, \u201cthe wheel stops with the puncture pointing at Carver\nCentre, I\u2019ll advance upon Carver Centre. Should it point to either of\nthe two other villages, I\u2019ll stop here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two to one shot against me, any way,\u201d he growled.\n\nKneeling in the road he spun the wheel, and as intently as at Monte\nCarlo and Palm Beach he had waited for other wheels to determine his\nfortune, he watched it come to rest. It stopped with the plug pointing\nback to Middleboro.\n\nThe scout told himself he was entitled to another trial. Again he spun\nthe wheel. Again the spokes flashed in the sun. Again the puncture\nrested on the road to Middleboro.\n\n\u201cIf it does that once more,\u201d thought the scout, \u201cit\u2019s a warning that\nthere is trouble ahead for me at Carver, and all the little Carvers.\u201d\n\nFor the third time the wheel flashed, but as he waited for the impetus\nto die, the sound of galloping hoofs broke sharply on the silence. The\nscout threw himself and his bicycle over the nearest stone wall, and,\nunlimbering his rifle, pointed it down the road.\n\nHe saw approaching a small boy, in a white apron, seated in a white\nwagon, on which was painted, \u201cPies and Pastry. East Wareham.\u201d The boy\ndragged his horse to an abrupt halt.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t point that at me!\u201d shouted the boy.\n\n\u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d demanded the scout.\n\n\u201cWareham,\u201d said the baker.\n\n\u201cAre you carrying any one concealed in that wagon?\u201d\n\nAs though to make sure the baker\u2019s boy glanced apprehensively into\nthe depths of his cart, and then answered that in the wagon he carried\nnothing but fresh-baked bread. To the trained nostrils of the scout this\nalready was evident. Before sunrise he had breakfasted on hard tack\nand muddy coffee, and the odor of crullers and mince pie, still warm,\nassailed him cruelly. He assumed a fierce and terrible aspect.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he challenged.\n\n\u201cTo Carver Centre,\u201d said the boy.\n\nTo chance Lathrop had left the decision. He believed the fates had\nanswered.\n\nDragging his bicycle over the stone wall, he fell into the road.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he commanded. \u201cI\u2019ll use your cart for a screen. I\u2019ll creep\nbehind the enemy before he sees me.\u201d\n\nThe baker\u2019s boy frowned unhappily.\n\n\u201cBut supposing,\u201d he argued, \u201cthey see you first, will they shoot?\u201d\n\nThe scout waved his hand carelessly.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he cried.\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d said the baker, \u201cmy horse will run away!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat of it?\u201d demanded the scout. \u201cAre Middleboro, South Middleboro,\nRock, Brockton, and Boston to fall? Are they to be captured because\nyou\u2019re afraid of your own horse? They won\u2019t shoot REAL bullets! This is\nnot a real war. Don\u2019t you know that?\u201d\n\nThe baker\u2019s boy flushed with indignation.\n\n\u201cSure, I know that,\u201d he protested; \u201cbut my horse--HE don\u2019t know that!\u201d\n\nLathrop slung his rifle over his shoulder and his leg over his bicycle.\n\n\u201cIf the Reds catch you,\u201d he warned, in parting, \u201cthey\u2019ll take everything\nyou\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Blues have took most of it already,\u201d wailed the boy. \u201cAnd just as\nthey were paying me the battle begun, and this horse run away, and I\ncouldn\u2019t get him to come back for my money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWar,\u201d exclaimed Lathrop morosely, \u201cis always cruel to the innocent.\u201d He\nsped toward Carver Centre. In his motor car, he had travelled the road\nmany times, and as always his goal had been the home of Miss Beatrice\nFarrar, he had covered it at a speed unrecognized by law. But now he\nadvanced with stealth and caution. In every clump of bushes he saw an\nambush. Behind each rock he beheld the enemy.\n\nIn a clearing was a group of Portuguese cranberry pickers, dressed as\nthough for a holiday. When they saw the man in uniform, one of the women\nhailed him anxiously.\n\n\u201cIs the parade coming?\u201d she called.\n\n\u201cHave you seen any of the Reds?\u201d Lathrop returned.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d complained the woman. \u201cAnd we been waiting all morning. When will\nthe parade come?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a parade,\u201d said Lathrop, severely. \u201cIt\u2019s a war!\u201d\n\nThe summer home of Miss Farrar stood close to the road. It had been so\nplaced by the farmer who built it, in order that the women folk might\nsit at the window and watch the passing of the stage-coach and the\npeddler. Great elms hung over it, and a white fence separated the road\nfrom the narrow lawn. At a distance of a hundred yards a turn brought\nthe house into view, and at this turn, as had been his manoeuvre at\nevery other possible ambush, Lathrop dismounted and advanced on foot. Up\nto this moment the road had been empty, but now, in front of the Farrar\ncottage, it was blocked by a touring-car and a station wagon. In the\noccupants of the car he recognized all the members of the Farrar\nfamily, except Miss Farrar. In the station wagon were all of the Farrar\nservants. Miss Farrar herself was leaning upon the gate and waving them\na farewell. The touring-car moved off down the road; the station wagon\nfollowed; Miss Farrar was alone. Lathrop scorched toward her, and when\nhe was opposite the gate, dug his toes in the dust and halted. When he\nlifted his broad-brimmed campaign hat, Miss Farrar exclaimed both with\nsurprise and displeasure. Drawing back from the gate she held herself\nerect. Her attitude was that of one prepared for instant retreat. When\nshe spoke it was in tones of extreme disapproval.\n\n\u201cYou promised,\u201d said the girl, \u201cyou would not come to see me.\u201d\n\nLathrop, straddling his bicycle, peered anxiously down the road.\n\n\u201cThis is not a social call,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on duty. Have you seen the\nReds?\u201d\n\nHis tone was brisk and alert, his manner preoccupied. The ungraciousness\nof his reception did not seem in the least to disconcert him.\n\nBut Miss Farrar was not deceived. She knew him, not only as a persistent\nand irrepressible lover, but as one full of guile, adroit in tricks,\nfertile in expedients. He was one who could not take \u201cNo\u201d for an\nanswer--at least not from her. When she repulsed him she seemed to grow\nin his eyes only the more attractive.\n\n\u201cIt is not the lover who comes to woo,\u201d he was constantly explaining,\n\u201cbut the lover\u2019s WAY of wooing.\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar had assured him she did not like his way. She objected\nto being regarded and treated as a castle that could be taken only by\nassault. Whether she wished time to consider, or whether he and his\nproposal were really obnoxious to her, he could not find out. His policy\nof campaign was that she, also, should not have time to find out. Again\nand again she had agreed to see him only on the condition that he would\nnot make love to her. He had promised again and again, and had failed\nto keep that promise. Only a week before he had been banished from her\npresence, to remain an exile until she gave him permission to see her\nat her home in New York. It was not her purpose to return there for two\nweeks, and yet here he was, a beggar at her gate. It might be that he\nwas there, as he said, \u201con duty,\u201d but her knowledge of him and of the\ndoctrine of chances caused her to doubt it.\n\n\u201cMr. Lathrop!\u201d she began, severely.\n\nAs though to see to whom she had spoken Lathrop glanced anxiously over\nhis shoulder. Apparently pained and surprised to find that it was to him\nshe had addressed herself, he regarded her with deep reproach. His eyes\nwere very beautiful. It was a fact which had often caused Miss Farrar\nextreme annoyance.\n\nHe shook his head sadly.\n\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Lathrop?\u2019\u201d he protested. \u201cYou know that to you I am always\n\u2018Charles--Charles the Bold,\u2019 because I am bold to love you; but never\n\u2018Mr. Lathrop,\u2019 unless,\u201d he went on briskly, \u201cyou are referring to a\nfuture state, when, as Mrs. Lathrop, you will make me--\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar had turned her back on him, and was walking rapidly up the\npath.\n\n\u201cBeatrice,\u201d he called. \u201cI am coming after you!\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar instantly returned and placed both hands firmly upon the\ngate.\n\n\u201cI cannot understand you!\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see that when you act\nas you do now, I can\u2019t even respect you? How do you think I could ever\ncare, when you offend me so? You jest at what you pretend is the most\nserious thing in your life. You play with it--laugh at it!\u201d\n\nThe young man interrupted her sharply.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I am with you I am so happy I can\u2019t be\nserious. When I am NOT with you, it is SO serious that I am utterly and\ncompletely wretched. You say my love offends you, bores you! I am sorry,\nbut what, in heaven\u2019s name, do you think your NOT loving me is doing to\nME? I am a wreck! I am a skeleton! Look at me!\u201d\n\nHe let his bicycle fall, and stood with his hands open at his sides, as\nthough inviting her to gaze upon the ruin she had caused.\n\nFour days of sun and rain, astride of a bicycle, without food or sleep,\nhad drawn his face into fine, hard lines, had bronzed it with a healthy\ntan. His uniform, made by the same tailor that fitted him with polo\nbreeches, clung to him like a jersey. The spectacle he presented was\nthat of an extremely picturesque, handsome, manly youth, and of that\nfact no one was better aware than himself.\n\n\u201cLook at me,\u201d he begged, sadly.\n\nMiss Farrar was entirely unimpressed.\n\n\u201cI am!\u201d she returned, coldly. \u201cI never saw you looking so well--and you\nknow it.\u201d She gave a gasp of comprehension. \u201cYou came here because you\nknew your uniform was becoming!\u201d\n\nLathrop regarded himself complacently.\n\n\u201cYes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he assented. \u201cI brought on this war in order to wear\nit. If you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he added, \u201cI think I\u2019ll accept your invitation\nand come inside. I\u2019ve had nothing to eat in four days.\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar\u2019s eyes flashed indignantly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re NOT coming inside,\u201d she declared; \u201cbut if you\u2019ll only promise to\ngo away at once, I\u2019ll bring you everything in the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that house,\u201d exclaimed Lathrop, dramatically, \u201cthere\u2019s only one\nthing that I desire, and I want that so badly that \u2018life holds no charm\nwithout you.\u2019\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar regarded him steadily.\n\n\u201cDo you intend to drive me away from my own door, or will you go?\u201d\n\nLathrop picked his wheel out of the dust.\n\n\u201cGood-by,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll come back when you have made up your mind.\u201d\n\nIn vexation Miss Farrar stamped her foot upon the path.\n\n\u201cI HAVE made up my mind!\u201d she protested.\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d returned Lathrop, \u201cI\u2019ll come back when you have changed it.\u201d\n\nHe made a movement as though to ride away, but much to Miss Farrar\u2019s\ndismay, hastily dismounted. \u201cOn second thoughts,\u201d he said, \u201cit isn\u2019t\nright for me to leave you. The woods are full of tramps and hangers-on\nof the army. You\u2019re not safe. I can watch this road from here as well as\nfrom anywhere else, and at the same time I can guard you.\u201d\n\nTo the consternation of Miss Farrar he placed his bicycle against the\nfence, and, as though preparing for a visit, leaned his elbows upon it.\n\n\u201cI do not wish to be rude,\u201d said Miss Farrar, \u201cbut you are annoying me.\nI have spent fifteen summers in Massachusetts, and I have never seen a\ntramp. I need no one to guard me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf not you,\u201d said Lathrop easily, \u201cthen the family silver. And think\nof your jewels, and your mother\u2019s jewels. Think of yourself in a house\nfilled with jewels, and entirely surrounded by hostile armies! My duty\nis to remain with you.\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar was so long in answering, that Lathrop lifted his head\nand turned to look. He found her frowning and gazing intently into the\nshadow of the woods, across the road. When she felt his eyes upon her\nshe turned her own guiltily upon him. Her cheeks were flushed and her\nface glowed with some unusual excitement.\n\n\u201cI wish,\u201d she exclaimed breathlessly--\u201cI wish,\u201d she repeated, \u201cthe Reds\nwould take you prisoner!\u201d\n\n\u201cTake me where?\u201d asked Lathrop.\n\n\u201cTake you anywhere!\u201d cried Miss Farrar. \u201cYou should be ashamed to talk\nto me when you should be looking for the enemy!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am WAITING for the enemy,\u201d explained Lathrop. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing.\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar smiled vindictively. Her eyes shone. \u201cYou need not wait\nlong,\u201d she said. There was a crash of a falling stone wall, and of\nparting bushes, but not in time to give Lathrop warning. As though from\nthe branches of the trees opposite two soldiers fell into the road;\naround his hat each wore the red band of the invader; each pointed his\nrifle at Lathrop.\n\n\u201cHands up!\u201d shouted one. \u201cYou\u2019re my prisoner!\u201d cried the other.\n\nMechanically Lathrop raised his hands, but his eyes turned to Miss\nFarrar.\n\n\u201cDid you know?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI have been watching them,\u201d she said, \u201ccreeping up on you for the last\nten minutes.\u201d\n\nLathrop turned to the two soldiers, and made an effort to smile.\n\n\u201cThat was very clever,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I have twenty men up the road, and\nbehind them a regiment. You had better get away while you can.\u201d\n\nThe two Reds laughed derisively. One, who wore the stripes of a\nsergeant, answered: \u201cThat won\u2019t do! We been a mile up the road, and you\nand us are the only soldiers on it. Gimme the gun!\u201d\n\nLathrop knew he had no right to refuse. He had been fairly surprised,\nbut he hesitated. When Miss Farrar was not in his mind his amateur\nsoldiering was to him a most serious proposition. The war game was a\nserious proposition, and that, through his failure for ten minutes to\nregard it seriously, he had been made a prisoner, mortified him keenly.\nThat his humiliation had taken place in the presence of Beatrice Farrar\ndid not lessen his discomfort, nor did the explanation he must later\nmake to his captain afford him any satisfaction. Already he saw himself\nplaying the star part in a court-martial. He shrugged his shoulders and\nsurrendered his gun.\n\nAs he did so he gloomily scrutinized the insignia of his captors.\n\n\u201cWho took me?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWE took you,\u201d exclaimed the sergeant.\n\n\u201cWhat regiment?\u201d demanded Lathrop, sharply. \u201cI have to report who took\nme; and you probably don\u2019t know it, but your collar ornaments are upside\ndown.\u201d With genuine exasperation he turned to Miss Farrar.\n\n\u201cLord!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cisn\u2019t it bad enough to be taken prisoner, without\nbeing taken by raw recruits that can\u2019t put on their uniforms?\u201d\n\nThe Reds flushed, and the younger, a sandy-haired, rat-faced youth,\nretorted angrily: \u201cMebbe we ain\u2019t strong on uniforms, beau,\u201d he snarled,\n\u201cbut you\u2019ve got nothing on us yet, that I can see. You look pretty with\nyour hands in the air, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d commanded the other Red. He was the older man, heavily built,\nwith a strong, hard mouth and chin, on which latter sprouted a three\ndays\u2019 iron-gray beard. \u201cDon\u2019t you see he\u2019s an officer? Officers don\u2019t\nlike being took by two-spot privates.\u201d\n\nLathrop gave a sudden start. \u201cWhy,\u201d he laughed, incredulously, \u201cdon\u2019t\nyou know--\u201d He stopped, and his eyes glanced quickly up and down the\nroad.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t we know what?\u201d demanded the older Red, suspiciously.\n\n\u201cI forgot,\u201d said Lathrop. \u201cI--I must not give information to the\nenemy--\u201d\n\nFor an instant there was a pause, while the two Reds stood irresolute.\nThen the older nodded the other to the side of the road, and in whispers\nthey consulted eagerly.\n\nMiss Farrar laughed, and Lathrop moved toward her.\n\n\u201cI deserve worse than being laughed at,\u201d he said. \u201cI made a strategic\nmistake. I should not have tried to capture you and an army corps at the\nsame time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d she taunted, \u201cwho were always so keen on soldiering, to be taken\nprisoner,\u201d she lowered her voice, \u201cand by men like that! Aren\u2019t they\nfunny?\u201d she whispered, \u201cand East Side and Tenderloin! It made me\nhomesick to hear them! I think when not in uniform the little one drives\na taxicab, and the big one is a guard on the elevated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey certainly are very \u2018New York,\u2019\u201d assented Lathrop, \u201cand very\ntough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought,\u201d whispered Miss Farrar, \u201cthose from New York with the Red\nArmy were picked men.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d exclaimed Lathrop. \u201cIt\u2019s just as humiliating to\nbe captured by a ballroom boy as by a mere millionaire! I can\u2019t insist\non the invading army being entirely recruited from Harvard graduates.\u201d\n\nThe two Reds either had reached a decision, or agreed that they could\nnot agree, for they ceased whispering, and crossed to where Lathrop\nstood.\n\n\u201cWe been talking over your case,\u201d explained the sergeant, \u201cand we see\nwe are in wrong. We see we made a mistake in taking you prisoner. We had\nought to shot you dead. So now we\u2019re going to shoot you dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d objected Lathrop. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. You should have thought\nof that sooner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d admitted the sergeant, \u201cbut a prisoner is a hell of a\nnuisance. If you got a prisoner to look after you can\u2019t do your own\nwork; you got to keep tabs on him. And there ain\u2019t nothing in it for the\nprisoner, neither. If we take you, you\u2019ll have to tramp all the way to\nour army, and all the way back. But, if you\u2019re dead, how different! You\nain\u2019t no bother to anybody. You got a half holiday all to yourself, and\nyou can loaf around the camp, so dead that they can\u2019t make you work, but\nnot so dead you can\u2019t smoke or eat.\u201d The sergeant smiled ingratiatingly.\nIn a tempting manner he exhibited his rifle. \u201cBetter be dead,\u201d he urged.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to oblige you,\u201d said Lathrop, \u201cbut it\u2019s against the rules. You\nCAN\u2019T shoot a prisoner.\u201d\n\nThe rat-faced soldier uttered an angry exclamation. \u201cTo hell with the\nrules!\u201d he cried. \u201cWe can\u2019t waste time on him. Turn him loose!\u201d\n\nThe older man rounded on the little one savagely. The tone in which he\naddressed him was cold, menacing, sinister. His words were simple, but\nhis eyes and face were heavy with warning.\n\n\u201cWho is running this?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe little soldier muttered, and shuffled away. From under the brim of\nhis campaign hat, his eyes cast furtive glances up and down the road.\nAs though anxious to wipe out the effect of his comrade\u2019s words, the\nsergeant addressed Lathrop suavely and in a tone of conciliation.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he explained, \u201chim and me are scouts. We\u2019re not supposed to\nwaste time taking prisoners. So, we\u2019ll set you free.\u201d He waved his hand\ninvitingly toward the bicycle. \u201cYou can go!\u201d he said.\n\nTo Miss Farrar\u2019s indignation Lathrop, instead of accepting his freedom,\nremained motionless.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on post. My captain ordered me to stay in front\nof this house until I was relieved.\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar, amazed at such duplicity, exclaimed aloud:\n\n\u201cHe is NOT on post!\u201d she protested. \u201cHe\u2019s a scout! He wants to stop\nhere, because--because--he\u2019s hungry. I wouldn\u2019t have let you take him\nprisoner, if I had not thought you would take him away with you.\u201d She\nappealed to the sergeant. \u201cPLEASE take him away,\u201d she begged.\n\nThe sergeant turned sharply upon his prisoner.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do what the lady wants?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve got to do what my captain wants,\u201d returned Lathrop, \u201cand\nhe put me on sentry-go, in front of this house.\u201d\n\nWith the back of his hand, the sergeant fretfully scraped the three\ndays\u2019 growth on his chin. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to it,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cbut\nfor to take him with us. When we meet some more Reds we\u2019ll turn him\nover. Fall in!\u201d he commanded.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d protested Lathrop. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be turned over. I\u2019ve got a\nmuch better plan. YOU don\u2019t want to be bothered with a prisoner. I don\u2019t\nwant to be a prisoner. As you say, I am better dead. You can\u2019t shoot\na prisoner, but if he tries to escape you can. I\u2019ll try to escape. You\nshoot me. Then I return to my own army, and report myself dead. That\nends your difficulty and saves me from a court-martial. They can\u2019t\ncourt-martial a corpse.\u201d\n\nThe face of the sergeant flashed with relief and satisfaction. In his\nanxiety to rid himself of his prisoner, he lifted the bicycle into the\nroad and held it in readiness.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all right!\u201d he said, heartily. \u201cYou can make your getaway as\nquick as you like.\u201d\n\nBut to the conspiracy Miss Farrar refused to lend herself.\n\n\u201cHow do you know,\u201d she demanded, \u201cthat he will keep his promise? He\nmay not go back to his own army. He can be just as dead on my lawn as\nanywhere else!\u201d\n\nLathrop shook his head at her sadly.\n\n\u201cHow you wrong me!\u201d he protested. \u201cHow dare you doubt the promise of a\ndying man? These are really my last words, and I wish I could think of\nsomething to say suited to the occasion, but the presence of strangers\nprevents.\u201d\n\nHe mounted his bicycle. \u201c\u2018If I had a thousand lives to give,\u2019\u201d he\nquoted with fervor, \u201c\u2018I\u2019d give them all to--\u2019\u201d he hesitated, and smiled\nmournfully on Miss Farrar. Seeing her flushed and indignant countenance,\nhe added, with haste, \u201cto the Commonwealth of Massachusetts!\u201d\n\nAs he started on his wheel slowly down the path, he turned to the\nsergeant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m escaping,\u201d he explained. The Reds, with an enthusiasm undoubtedly\ngenuine, raised their rifles, and the calm of the Indian summer was\nshattered by two sharp reports. Lathrop, looking back over his shoulder,\nwaved one hand reassuringly.\n\n\u201cDeath was instantaneous,\u201d he called. He bent his body over the\nhandle-bar, and they watched him disappear rapidly around the turn in\nthe road.\n\nMiss Farrar sighed with relief.\n\n\u201cThank you very much,\u201d she said.\n\nAs though signifying that to oblige a woman he would shoot any number of\nprisoners, the sergeant raised his hat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, lady,\u201d he said. \u201cI seen he was annoying you, and\nthat\u2019s why I got rid of him. Some of them amateur soldiers, as soon as\nthey get into uniform, are too fresh. He took advantage of you because\nyour folks were away from home. But don\u2019t you worry about that. I\u2019ll\nguard this house until your folks get back.\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar protested warmly.\n\n\u201cReally!\u201d she exclaimed; \u201cI need no one to guard me.\u201d\n\nBut the soldier was obdurate. He motioned his comrade down the road.\n\n\u201cWatch at the turn,\u201d he ordered; \u201che may come back or send some of the\nBlues to take us. I\u2019ll stay here and protect the lady.\u201d\n\nAgain Miss Farrar protested, but the sergeant, in a benign and fatherly\nmanner, smiled approvingly. Seating himself on the grass outside the\nfence, he leaned his back against the gatepost, apparently settling\nhimself for conversation.\n\n\u201cNow, how long might it have been,\u201d he asked, \u201cbefore we showed up, that\nyou seen us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw you,\u201d Miss Farrar said, \u201cwhen Mr.--when that bicycle scout was\ntalking to me. I saw the red bands on your hats among the bushes.\u201d\n\nThe sergeant appeared interested.\n\n\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you let on to him?\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar laughed evasively.\n\n\u201cMaybe because I am from New York, too,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps I wanted to\nsee soldiers from my city take a prisoner.\u201d\n\nThey were interrupted by the sudden appearance of the smaller soldier.\nOn his rat-like countenance was written deep concern.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the turn,\u201d he began, breathlessly, \u201cI couldn\u2019t see him.\nWhere did he go? Did he double back through the woods, or did he have\ntime to ride out of sight before I got there?\u201d\n\nThe reappearance of his comrade affected the sergeant strangely. He\nsprang to his feet, his under jaw protruding truculently, his eyes\nflashing with anger.\n\n\u201cGet back,\u201d he snarled. \u201cDo what I told you!\u201d\n\nUnder his breath he muttered words that, to Miss Farrar, were\nunintelligible. The little rat-like man nodded, and ran from them down\nthe road. The sergeant made an awkward gesture of apology.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, lady,\u201d he begged, \u201cbut it makes me hot when them rookies\nwon\u2019t obey orders. You see,\u201d he ran on glibly, \u201cI\u2019m a reg\u2019lar; served\nthree years in the Philippines, and I can\u2019t get used to not having my\nmen do what I say.\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar nodded, and started toward the house. The sergeant sprang\nquickly across the road.\n\n\u201cHave you ever been in the Philippines, Miss?\u201d he called. \u201cIt\u2019s a great\ncountry.\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar halted and shook her head. She was considering how far\npoliteness required of her to entertain unshaven militiamen, who\ninsisted on making sentries of themselves at her front gate.\n\nThe sergeant had plunged garrulously into a confusing description of the\nFar East. He was clasping the pickets of the fence with his hands,\nand his eyes were fastened on hers. He lacked neither confidence nor\nvocabulary, and not for an instant did his tongue hesitate or his eyes\nwander, and yet in his manner there was nothing at which she could take\noffence. He appeared only amiably vain that he had seen much of the\nworld, and anxious to impress that fact upon another. Miss Farrar was\nbored, but the man gave her no opportunity to escape. In consequence she\nwas relieved when the noisy approach of an automobile brought him to\nan abrupt pause. Coming rapidly down the road was a large touring-car,\nfilled with men in khaki. The sergeant gave one glance at it, and leaped\nacross the road, taking cover behind the stone wall. Instantly he raised\nhis head above it and shook his fist at Miss Farrar.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell,\u201d he commanded. \u201cThey\u2019re Blues in that car! Don\u2019t tell!\u201d\n Again he sank from sight.\n\nMiss Farrar now was more than bored, she was annoyed. Why grown men\nshould play at war so seriously she could not understand. It was absurd!\nShe no longer would remain a party to it; and, lest the men in the car\nmight involve her still further, she retreated hastily toward the house.\nAs she opened the door the car halted at the gate, and voices called to\nher, but she pretended not to hear them, and continued up the stairs.\nBehind her the car passed noisily on its way.\n\nShe mounted the stairs, and crossing a landing moved down a long hall,\nat the further end of which was her bedroom. The hall was uncarpeted,\nbut the tennis shoes she wore made no sound, nor did the door of her\nbedroom when she pushed it open.\n\nOn the threshold Miss Farrar stood quite still. A swift, sinking nausea\nheld her in a vice. Her instinct was to scream and run, but her throat\nhad tightened and gone dry, and her limbs trembled. Opposite the door\nwas her dressing-table, and reflected in its mirror were the features\nand figure of the rat-like soldier. His back was toward her. With one\nhand he swept the dressing-table. The other, hanging at his side, held\na revolver. In a moment the panic into which Miss Farrar had been thrown\npassed. Her breath and blood returned, and, intent only on flight, she\nsoftly turned. On the instant the rat-faced one raised his eyes, saw her\nreflected in the mirror, and with an oath, swung toward her. He drew the\nrevolver close to his cheek, and looked at her down the barrel. \u201cDon\u2019t\nmove!\u201d he whispered; \u201cdon\u2019t scream! Where are the jewels?\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar was not afraid of the revolver or of the man. She did not\nbelieve either would do her harm. The idea of both the presence of the\nman in her room, and that any one should dare to threaten her was what\nfilled her with repugnance. As the warm blood flowed again through her\nbody her spirit returned. She was no longer afraid. She was, instead,\nindignant, furious.\n\nWith one step she was in the room, leaving the road to the door open.\n\n\u201cGet out of here,\u201d she commanded.\n\nThe little man snarled, and stamped the floor. He shoved the gun nearer\nto her.\n\n\u201cThe jewels, damn you!\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you want me to blow your fool\nhead off? Where are the jewels?\u201d\n\n\u201cJewels?\u201d repeated Miss Farrar. \u201cI have no jewels!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou lie!\u201d shrieked the little man. \u201cHe said the house was full of\njewels. We heard him. He said he would stay to guard the jewels.\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar recognized his error. She remembered Lathrop\u2019s jest, and\nthat it had been made while the two men were within hearing, behind the\nstone wall.\n\n\u201cIt was a joke!\u201d she cried. \u201cLeave at once!\u201d She backed swiftly toward\nthe open window that looked upon the road. \u201cOr I\u2019ll call your sergeant!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you go near that window or scream,\u201d whispered the rat-like one,\n\u201cI\u2019ll shoot!\u201d\n\nA heavy voice, speaking suddenly from the doorway, shook Miss Farrar\u2019s\njangled nerves into fresh panic.\n\n\u201cShe won\u2019t scream,\u201d said the voice.\n\nIn the door Miss Farrar saw the bulky form of the sergeant, blocking her\nescape.\n\nWithout shifting his eyes from Miss Farrar, the man with the gun cursed\nbreathlessly at the other. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you keep her away?\u201d he panted.\n\n\u201cAn automobile stopped in front of the gate,\u201d explained the sergeant.\n\u201cHave you got them?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d returned the other. \u201cNothing! She won\u2019t tell where they are.\u201d\n\nThe older man laughed. \u201cOh, yes, she\u2019ll tell,\u201d he whispered. His voice\nwas still low and suave, but it carried with it the weight of a threat,\nand the threat, although unspoken, filled Miss Farrar with alarm. Her\neyes, wide with concern, turned fearfully from one man to the other.\n\nThe sergeant stretched his hands toward her, the fingers working and\nmaking clutches in the air. The look in his eyes was quite terrifying.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cI\u2019ll choke it out of you!\u201d\n\nIf his intention was to frighten the girl, he succeeded admirably. With\nher hands clasped to her throat, Miss Farrar sank against the wall. She\nsaw no chance of escape. The way to the door was barred, and should she\ndrop to the garden below, from the window, before she could reach the\nroad the men would overtake her. Even should she reach the road, the\nhouse nearest was a half mile distant.\n\nThe sergeant came close, his fingers opening and closing in front of her\neyes. He raised his voice to a harsh, bellowing roar. \u201cI\u2019m going to make\nyou tell!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI\u2019m going to choke it out of you!\u201d\n\nAlthough she was alone in the house, although on every side the pine\nwoods encompassed her, Miss Farrar threw all her strength into one long,\npiercing cry for help. And upon the instant it was answered. From the\nhall came the swift rush of feet. The rat-like one swung toward it. From\nhis revolver came a report that shook the room, a flash and a burst of\nsmoke, and through it Miss Farrar saw Lathrop hurl himself. He dived at\nthe rat-like one, and as on the foot-ball field he had been taught to\nstop a runner, flung his arms around the other\u2019s knees. The legs of the\nman shot from under him, his body cut a half circle through the air, and\nthe part of his anatomy to first touch the floor was his head. The\nfloor was of oak, and the impact gave forth a crash like the smash of a\nbase-ball bat, when it drives the ball to centre field. The man did not\nmove. He did not even groan. In his relaxed fingers the revolver lay,\nwithin reach of Lathrop\u2019s hand. He fell upon it and, still on his knees,\npointed it at the sergeant.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re MY prisoner, now!\u201d he shouted cheerfully. \u201cHands up!\u201d\n\nThe man raised his arms slowly, as if he were lifting heavy dumb-bells.\n\n\u201cThe lady called for help,\u201d he said. \u201cI came to help her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! No!\u201d protested the girl. \u201cHe did NOT help me! He said he would\nchoke me if I didn\u2019t--\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he would--what!\u201d bellowed Lathrop. He leaped to his feet, and\nsent the gun spinning through the window. He stepped toward the man\ngingerly, on the balls of his feet, like one walking on ice. The man\nseemed to know what that form of approach threatened, for he threw his\narms into a position of defence.\n\n\u201cYou bully!\u201d whispered Lathrop. \u201cYou coward! You choke women, do you?\u201d\n\nHe shifted from one foot to the other, his body balancing forward,\nhis arms swinging limply in front of him. With his eyes, he seemed to\nundress the man, as though choosing a place to strike.\n\n\u201cI made the same mistake you did,\u201d he taunted. \u201cI should have killed you\nfirst. Now I am going to do it!\u201d\n\nHe sprang at the man, his chin still sunk on his chest, but with his\narms swinging like the spokes of a wheel. His opponent struck back\nheavily, violently, but each move of his arm seemed only to open up\nsome vulnerable spot. Blows beat upon his chin, upon his nose, his eyes;\nblows jabbed him in the ribs, drove his breath from his stomach, ground\nhis teeth together, cut the flesh from his cheeks. He sank to his knees,\nwith his arms clasping his head.\n\n\u201cGet up!\u201d roared Lathrop. \u201cStand up to it, you coward!\u201d\n\nBut the man had no idea of standing up to it. Howling with pain, he\nscrambled toward the door, and fled staggering down the hall.\n\nAt the same moment the automobile that a few minutes before had passed\nup the road came limping to the gate, and a half-dozen men in uniform\nsprang out of it. From the window Lathrop saw them spread across the\nlawn and surround the house.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got him!\u201d he said. He pointed to the prostrate figure on the\nfloor. \u201cHe and the other one,\u201d he explained, breathlessly, \u201care New York\ncrooks! They have been looting in the wake of the Reds, disguised as\nsoldiers. I knew they weren\u2019t even amateur soldiers by the mistakes in\ntheir make-up, and I made that bluff of riding away so as to give them\ntime to show what the game was. Then, that provost guard in the motor\ncar stopped me, and when they said who they were after, I ordered them\nback here. But they had a flat tire, and my bicycle beat them.\u201d\n\nIn his excitement he did not notice that the girl was not listening,\nthat she was very pale, that she was breathing quickly, and trembling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go tell them,\u201d he added, \u201cthat the other one they want is up\nhere.\u201d\n\nMiss Farrar\u2019s strength instantly returned.\n\nWith a look of terror at the now groaning figure on the floor, she\nsprang toward Lathrop, with both hands clutching him by his sleeves.\n\n\u201cYou will NOT!\u201d she commanded. \u201cYou will not leave me alone!\u201d\n\nAppealingly she raised her face to his startled countenance. With\na burst of tears she threw herself into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m afraid!\u201d she\nsobbed. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me. Please, no matter what I say, never leave me\nagain!\u201d\n\nBetween bewilderment and joy, the face of Lathrop was unrecognizable. As\nher words reached him, as he felt the touch of her body in his arms, and\nher warm, wet cheek against his own, he drew a deep sigh of content, and\nthen, fearfully and tenderly, held her close.\n\nAfter a pause, in which peace came to all the world, he raised his head.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d he said. \u201cYou can BET I won\u2019t leave you!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",
