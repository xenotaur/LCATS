    "body": "\n_The Romantics used to say that the eyes were the windows of the Soul.\nA good Alien Xenologist might not put it quite so poetically ... but he\ncan, if he\u2019s sharp, read a lot in the look of an eye!_\n\n\n\n\u201cWe ought to scrape this planet clean of every living thing on it,\u201d\nmuttered Umbo Stetson, section chief of Investigation & Adjustment.\n\nStetson paced the landing control bridge of his scout cruiser. His\nfootsteps grated on a floor that was the rear wall of the bridge during\nflight. But now the ship rested on its tail fins\u2014all four hundred\nglistening red and black meters of it. The open ports of the bridge\nlooked out on the jungle roof of Gienah III some one hundred fifty\nmeters below. A butter yellow sun hung above the horizon, perhaps an\nhour from setting.\n\n\u201cClean as an egg!\u201d he barked. He paused in his round of the bridge,\nglared out the starboard port, spat into the fire-blackened circle that\nthe cruiser\u2019s jets had burned from the jungle.\n\nThe I-A section chief was dark-haired, gangling, with large head and big\nfeatures. He stood in his customary slouch, a stance not improved by\nsacklike patched blue fatigues. Although on this present operation he\nrated the flag of a division admiral, his fatigues carried no insignia.\nThere was a general unkempt, straggling look about him.\n\nLewis Orne, junior I-A field man with a maiden diploma, stood at the\nopposite port, studying the jungle horizon. Now and then he glanced at\nthe bridge control console, the chronometer above it, the big translite\nmap of their position tilted from the opposite bulkhead. A heavy planet\nnative, he felt vaguely uneasy on this Gienah III with its gravity of\nonly seven-eighths Terran Standard. The surgical scars on his neck where\nthe micro-communications equipment had been inserted itched maddeningly.\nHe scratched.\n\n\u201cHah!\u201d said Stetson. \u201cPoliticians!\u201d\n\nA thin black insect with shell-like wings flew in Orne\u2019s port, settled\nin his close-cropped red hair. Orne pulled the insect gently from his\nhair, released it. Again it tried to land in his hair. He ducked. It\nflew across the bridge, out the port beside Stetson.\n\nThere was a thick-muscled, no-fat look to Orne, but something about his\nblocky, off-center features suggested a clown.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of waiting,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c_You\u2019re_ tired! Hah!\u201d\n\nA breeze rippled the tops of the green ocean below them. Here and there,\nred and purple flowers jutted from the verdure, bending and nodding like\nan attentive audience.\n\n\u201cJust look at that blasted jungle!\u201d barked Stetson. \u201cThem and their\nstupid orders!\u201d\n\nA call bell tinkled on the bridge control console. The red light above\nthe speaker grid began blinking. Stetson shot an angry glance at it.\n\u201cYeah, Hal?\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K., Stet. Orders just came through. We use Plan C. ComGO says to\nbrief the field man, and jet out of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you ask them about using another field man?\u201d\n\nOrne looked up attentively.\n\nThe speaker said: \u201cYes. They said we have to use Orne because of the\nrecords on the _Delphinus_.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, will they give us more time to brief him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNegative. It\u2019s crash priority. ComGO expects to blast the planet\nanyway.\u201d\n\nStetson glared at the grid. \u201cThose fat-headed, lard-bottomed,\npig-brained ... POLITICIANS!\u201d He took two deep breaths, subsided. \u201cO.K.\nTell them we\u2019ll comply.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne more thing, Stet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a confirmed contact.\u201d\n\nInstantly, Stetson was poised on the balls of his feet, alert. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout ten kilometers out. Section AAB-6.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many?\u201d\n\n\u201cA mob. You want I should count them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. What\u2019re they doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking a beeline for us. You better get a move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K. Keep us posted.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\n\nStetson looked across at his junior field man. \u201cOrne, if you decide you\nwant out of this assignment, you just say the word. I\u2019ll back you to the\nhilt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should I want out of my first field assignment?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, and find out.\u201d Stetson crossed to a tilt-locker behind the big\ntranslite map, hauled out a white coverall uniform with gold insignia,\ntossed it to Orne. \u201cGet into these while I brief you on the map.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is an R&R uni\u2014\u201d began Orne.\n\n\u201cGet that uniform on your ugly frame!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, Admiral Stetson, sir. Right away, sir. But I thought I was\nthrough with old Rediscovery & Reeducation when you drafted me off of\nHamal into the I-A ... sir.\u201d He began changing from the I-A blue to the\nR&R white. Almost as an afterthought, he said: \u201c... Sir.\u201d\n\nA wolfish grin cracked Stetson\u2019s big features. \u201cI\u2019m soooooo happy you\nhave the proper attitude of subservience toward authority.\u201d\n\nOrne zipped up the coverall uniform. \u201cOh, yes, sir ... sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K., Orne, pay attention.\u201d Stetson gestured at the map with its green\nsuperimposed grid squares. \u201cHere we are. Here\u2019s that city we flew over\non our way down. You\u2019ll head for it as soon as we drop you. The place is\nbig enough that if you hold a course roughly northeast you can\u2019t miss\nit. We\u2019re\u2014\u201d\n\nAgain the call bell rang.\n\n\u201cWhat is it this time, Hal?\u201d barked Stetson.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve changed to Plan H, Stet. New orders cut.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive days?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all they can give us. ComGO says he can\u2019t keep the information\nout of High Commissioner Bullone\u2019s hands any longer than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s five days for sure then.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this the usual R&R foul-up?\u201d asked Orne.\n\nStetson nodded. \u201cThanks to Bullone and company! We\u2019re just one jump\nahead of catastrophe, but they still pump the bushwah into the Rah & Rah\nboys back at dear old Uni-Galacta!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making light of my revered alma mater,\u201d said Orne. He struck a\npose. \u201cWe must reunite the lost planets with our centers of culture and\nindustry, and take up the _glor_-ious onward march of mankind that was\nso _bru_-tally\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCan it!\u201d snapped Stetson. \u201cWe both know we\u2019re going to rediscover one\nplanet too many some day. Rim War all over again. But this is a\ndifferent breed of fish. It\u2019s not, repeat, _not_ a _re_-discovery.\u201d\n\nOrne sobered. \u201cAlien?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. A-L-I-E-N! A never-before-contacted culture. That language you\nwere force fed on the way over, that\u2019s an alien language. It\u2019s not\ncomplete ... all we have off the _minis_. And we excluded data on the\nnatives because we\u2019ve been hoping to dump this project and nobody the\nwiser.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly mazoo!\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-six days ago an I-A search ship came through here, had a routine\nmini-sneaker look at the place. When he combed in his net of sneakers to\ncheck the tapes and films, lo and behold, he had a little stranger.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of _theirs_?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. It was a _mini_ off the _Delphinus Rediscovery_. The _Delphinus_\nhas been unreported for eighteen standard months!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it crack up here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know. If it did, we haven\u2019t been able to spot it. She was\nsupposed to be way off in the Balandine System by now. But we\u2019ve\nsomething else on our minds. It\u2019s the one item that makes me want to\nblot out this place, and run home with my tail between my legs. We\u2019ve\na\u2014\u201d\n\nAgain the call bell chimed.\n\n\u201cNOW WHAT?\u201d roared Stetson into the speaker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a _mini_ over that mob, Stet. They\u2019re talking about us. It\u2019s a\ndefinite raiding party.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat armament?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo gloomy in that jungle to be sure. The infra beam\u2019s out on this\n_mini_. Looks like hard pellet rifles of some kind. Might even be off\nthe _Delphinus_.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you get closer?\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t do any good. No light down there, and they\u2019re moving up fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep an eye on them, but don\u2019t ignore the other sectors,\u201d said Stetson.\n\n\u201cYou think I was born yesterday?\u201d barked the voice from the grid. The\ncontact broke off with an angry sound.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I like about the I-A,\u201d said Stetson. \u201cIt collects such\neven-tempered types.\u201d He looked at the white uniform on Orne, wiped a\nhand across his mouth as though he\u2019d tasted something dirty.\n\n\u201cWhy _am_ I wearing this thing?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cDisguise.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no mustache!\u201d\n\nStetson smiled without humor. \u201cThat\u2019s one of I-A\u2019s answers to those\nfat-keistered politicians. We\u2019re setting up our own search system to\nfind the planets before _they_ do. We\u2019ve managed to put spies in key\nplaces at R&R. Any touchy planets our spies report, we divert the\nfiles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we look into them with bright boys like you\u2014disguised as R&R\nfield men.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoody, goody. And what happens if R&R stumbles onto me while I\u2019m down\nthere playing patty cake?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe disown you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you said an I-A ship found this joint.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did. And then one of our spies in R&R intercepted a _routine_\nrequest for an agent-instructor to be assigned here with full equipment.\nRequest signed by a First-Contact officer name of Diston ... of the\n_Delphinus_!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the Del\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Missing. The request was a forgery. Now you see why I\u2019m mostly\nfor rubbing out this place. Who\u2019d dare forge such a thing unless he knew\nfor sure that the original FC officer was missing ... or dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the jumped up mazoo are we doing here, Stet?\u201d asked Orne. \u201cAlien\ncalls for a full contact team with all of the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt calls for one planet-buster bomb ... buster\u2014in five days. Unless\nyou give them a white bill in the meantime. High Commissioner Bullone\nwill have word of this planet by then. If Gienah III still exists in\nfive days, can\u2019t you imagine the fun the politicians\u2019ll have with it?\nMama mia! We want this planet cleared for contact or dead before then.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this, Stet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYOU don\u2019t like it!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Orne. \u201cThere must be another way. Why ... when we teamed up\nwith the Alerinoids we gained five hundred years in the physical\nsciences alone, not to mention the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Alerinoids didn\u2019t knock over one of our survey ships first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if the _Delphinus_ just crashed here ... and the locals picked up\nthe pieces?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re going in to find out, Orne. But answer me this: If\nthey _do_ have the _Delphinus_, how long before a tool-using race could\nbe a threat to the galaxy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw that city they built, Stet. They could be dug in within six\nmonths, and there\u2019d be no\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nOrne shook his head. \u201cBut think of it: Two civilizations that matured\nalong different lines! Think of all the different ways we\u2019d approach the\nsame problems ... the lever that\u2019d give us for\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like a Uni-Galacta lecture! Are you through marching arm in\narm into the misty future?\u201d\n\nOrne took a deep breath. \u201cWhy\u2019s a freshman like me being tossed into\nthis dish?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d still be on the _Delphinus_ master lists as an R&R field man.\nThat\u2019s important if you\u2019re masquerading.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I the only one? I know I\u2019m a recent _convert_, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I just want to know why I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the bigdomes fed a set of requirements into one of their iron\nmonsters. Your card popped out. They were looking for somebody capable,\ndependable ... and ... _expendable_!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m down here briefing you instead of sitting back on a\nflagship. _I_ got you into the I-A. Now, you listen carefully: If you\npush the panic button on this one without cause, I will personally flay\nyou alive. We both know the advantages of an alien contact. But if you\nget into a hot spot, and call for help, I\u2019ll dive this cruiser into that\ncity to get you out!\u201d\n\nOrne swallowed. \u201cThanks, Stet. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take up a tight orbit. Out beyond us will be five\ntransports full of I-A marines and a Class IX Monitor with one\nplanet-buster. You\u2019re calling the shots, God help you! First, we want to\nknow if they have the _Delphinus_ ... and if so, where it is. Next, we\nwant to know just how warlike these goons are. Can we control them if\nthey\u2019re bloodthirsty. What\u2019s their potential?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn five days?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a second more.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we know about them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much. They look something like an ancient Terran chimpanzee ...\nonly with blue fur. Face is hairless, pink-skinned.\u201d Stetson snapped a\nswitch. The translite map became a screen with a figure frozen on it.\n\u201cLike that. This is life size.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like the missing link they\u2019re always hunting for,\u201d said Orne.\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019ve got a different kind of a missing link.\u201d\n\n\u201cVertical-slit pupils in their eyes,\u201d said Orne. He studied the figure.\nIt had been caught from the front by a mini-sneaker camera. About five\nfeet tall. The stance was slightly bent forward, long arms. Two vertical\nnose slits. A flat, lipless mouth. Receding chin. Four-fingered hands.\nIt wore a wide belt from which dangled neat pouches and what looked like\ntools, although their use was obscure. There appeared to be the tip of a\ntail protruding from behind one of the squat legs. Behind the creature\ntowered the faery spires of the city they\u2019d observed from the air.\n\n\u201cTails?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cYeah. They\u2019re arboreal. Not a road on the whole planet that we can\nfind. But there are lots of vine lanes through the jungles.\u201d Stetson\u2019s\nface hardened. \u201cMatch _that_ with a city as advanced as that one.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlave culture?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many cities have they?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found two. This one and another on the other side of the planet.\nBut the other one\u2019s a ruin.\u201d\n\n\u201cA ruin? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell us. Lots of mysteries here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the planet like?\u201d\n\n\u201cMostly jungle. There are polar oceans, lakes and rivers. One low\nmountain chain follows the equatorial belt about two thirds around the\nplanet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut only two cities. Are you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cReasonably so. It\u2019d be pretty hard to miss something the size of that\nthing we flew over. It must be fifty kilometers long and at least ten\nwide. Swarming with these creatures, too. We\u2019ve got a zone-count\nestimate that places the city\u2019s population at over thirty million.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhee-ew! Those are tall buildings, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know much about this place, Orne. And unless you bring them\ninto the fold, there\u2019ll be nothing but ashes for our archaeologists to\npick over.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeems a dirty shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree, but\u2014\u201d\n\nThe call bell jangled.\n\n\n\nStetson\u2019s voice sounded tired: \u201cYeah, Hal?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat mob\u2019s only about five kilometers out, Stet. We\u2019ve got Orne\u2019s gear\noutside in the disguised air sled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be right down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy a disguised sled?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cIf they think it\u2019s a ground buggy, they might get careless when you\nmost need an advantage. We could always scoop you out of the air, you\nknow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re my chances on this one, Stet?\u201d\n\nStetson shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m afraid they\u2019re slim. These goons probably have\nthe _Delphinus_, and they want you just long enough to get your\nequipment and everything you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cRough as that, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our best guess. If you\u2019re not out in five days, we blast.\u201d\n\nOrne cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cWant out?\u201d asked Stetson.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse the _back-door_ rule, son. Always leave yourself a way out. Now ...\nlet\u2019s check that equipment the surgeons put in your neck.\u201d Stetson put a\nhand to his throat. His mouth remained closed, but there was a\nsurf-hissing voice in Orne\u2019s ears: \u201cYou read me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. I can\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d hissed the voice. \u201cTouch the mike contact. Keep your mouth closed.\nJust use your speaking muscles without speaking.\u201d\n\nOrne obeyed.\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Stetson. \u201cYou come in loud and clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ought to. I\u2019m right on top of you!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a relay ship over you all the time,\u201d said Stetson. \u201cNow ...\nwhen you\u2019re not touching that mike contact this rig\u2019ll still feed us\nwhat you say ... and everything that goes on around you, too. We\u2019ll\nmonitor everything. Got that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nStetson held out his right hand. \u201cGood luck. I meant that about diving\nin for you. Just say the word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the word, too,\u201d said Orne. \u201cHELP!\u201d\n\n\n\nGray mud floor and gloomy aisles between monstrous bluish tree\ntrunks\u2014that was the jungle. Only the barest weak glimmering of sunlight\npenetrated to the mud. The disguised sled\u2014its para-grav units turned\noff\u2014lurched and skidded around buttress roots. Its headlights swung in\nwild arcs across the trunks and down to the mud. Aerial creepers\u2014great\nlooping vines of them\u2014swung down from the towering forest ceiling. A\nsteady drip of condensation spattered the windshield, forcing Orne to\nuse the wipers.\n\nIn the bucket seat of the sled\u2019s cab, Orne fought the controls. He was\nplagued by the vague slow-motion-floating sensation that a heavy planet\nnative always feels in lighter gravity. It gave him an unhappy stomach.\n\nThings skipped through the air around the lurching vehicle: flitting and\ndarting things. Insects came in twin cones, siphoned toward the\nheadlights. There was an endless chittering whistling tok-tok-toking in\nthe gloom beyond the lights.\n\nStetson\u2019s voice hissed suddenly through the surgically implanted\nspeaker: \u201cHow\u2019s it look?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlien.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny sign of that mob?\u201d\n\n\u201cNegative.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K. We\u2019re taking off.\u201d\n\nBehind Orne, there came a deep rumbling roar that receded as the scout\ncruiser climbed its jets. All other sounds hung suspended in\nafter-silence, then resumed: the strongest first and then the weakest.\n\nA heavy object suddenly arced through the headlights, swinging on a\nvine. It disappeared behind a tree. Another. Another. Ghostly shadows\nwith vine pendulums on both sides. Something banged down heavily onto\nthe hood of the sled.\n\nOrne braked to a creaking stop that shifted the load behind him, found\nhimself staring through the windshield at a native of Gienah III. The\nnative crouched on the hood, a Mark XX exploding-pellet rifle in his\nright hand directed at Orne\u2019s head. In the abrupt shock of meeting, Orne\nrecognized the weapon: standard issue to the marine guards on all R&R\nsurvey ships.\n\nThe native appeared the twin of the one Orne had seen on the translite\nscreen. The four-fingered hand looked extremely capable around the stock\nof the Mark XX.\n\nSlowly, Orne put a hand to his throat, pressed the contact button. He\nmoved his speaking muscles: _\u201cJust made contact with the mob. One on the\nhood now has one of our Mark XX rifles aimed at my head.\u201d_\n\nThe surf-hissing of Stetson\u2019s voice came through the hidden speaker:\n_\u201cWant us to come back?\u201d_\n\n_\u201cNegative. Stand by. He looks cautious rather than hostile.\u201d_\n\nOrne held up his right hand, palm out. He had a second thought: held up\nhis left hand, too. Universal symbol of peaceful intentions: empty\nhands. The gun muzzle lowered slightly. Orne called into his mind the\nlanguage that had been hypnoforced into him. _Ocheero? No. That means\n\u2018The People.\u2019 Ah ..._ And he had the heavy fricative greeting sound.\n\n\u201cFfroiragrazzi,\u201d he said.\n\nThe native shifted to the left, answered in pure, unaccented High\nGalactese: \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nOrne fought down a sudden panic. The lipless mouth had looked so odd\nforming the familiar words.\n\nStetson\u2019s voice hissed: _\u201cIs that the native speaking Galactese?\u201d_\n\nOrne touched his throat. _\u201cYou heard him.\u201d_\n\nHe dropped his hand, said: \u201cI am Lewis Orne of Rediscovery and\nReeducation. I was sent here at the request of the First-Contact officer\non the _Delphinus Rediscovery_.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is your ship?\u201d demanded the Gienahn.\n\n\u201cIt put me down and left.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was behind schedule for another appointment.\u201d\n\n\n\nOut of the corners of his eyes, Orne saw more shadows dropping to the\nmud around him. The sled shifted as someone climbed onto the load behind\nthe cab. The someone scuttled agilely for a moment.\n\nThe native climbed down to the cab\u2019s side step, opened the door. The\nrifle was held at the ready. Again, the lipless mouth formed Galactese\nwords: \u201cWhat do you carry in this ... vehicle?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe equipment every R&R field man uses to help the people of a\nrediscovered planet improve themselves.\u201d Orne nodded at the rifle.\n\u201cWould you mind pointing that weapon some other direction? It makes me\nnervous.\u201d\n\nThe gun muzzle remained unwaveringly on Orne\u2019s middle. The native\u2019s\nmouth opened, revealing long canines. \u201cDo we not look strange to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI take it there\u2019s been a heavy mutational variation in the humanoid\nnorm on this planet,\u201d said Orne. \u201cWhat is it? Hard radiation?\u201d\n\nNo answer.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really make any difference, of course,\u201d said Orne. \u201cI\u2019m here\nto help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Tanub, High Path Chief of the Grazzi,\u201d said the native. \u201cI decide\nwho is to help.\u201d\n\nOrne swallowed.\n\n\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d demanded Tanub.\n\n\u201cI was hoping to go to your city. Is it permitted?\u201d\n\nA long pause while the vertical-slit pupils of Tanub\u2019s eyes expanded and\ncontracted. \u201cIt is permitted.\u201d\n\nStetson\u2019s voice came through the hidden speaker: _\u201cAll bets off. We\u2019re\ncoming in after you. That Mark XX is the final straw. It means they have\nthe_ Delphinus _for sure!\u201d_\n\nOrne touched his throat. _\u201cNo! Give me a little more time!\u201d_\n\n_\u201cWhy?\u201d_\n\n_\u201cI have a hunch about these creatures.\u201d_\n\n_\u201cWhat is it?\u201d_\n\n_\u201cNo time now. Trust me.\u201d_\n\nAnother long pause in which Orne and Tanub continued to study each\nother. Presently, Stetson said: _\u201cO.K. Go ahead as planned. But find out\nwhere the_ Delphinus _is! If we get that back we pull their teeth.\u201d_\n\n\u201cWhy do you keep touching your throat?\u201d demanded Tanub.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d said Orne. \u201cGuns always make me nervous.\u201d\n\nThe muzzle lowered slightly.\n\n\u201cShall we continue on to your city?\u201d asked Orne. He wet his lips with\nhis tongue. The cab light on Tanub\u2019s face was giving the Gienahn an\neerie sinister look.\n\n\u201cWe can go soon,\u201d said Tanub.\n\n\u201cWill you join me inside here?\u201d asked Orne. \u201cThere\u2019s a passenger seat\nright behind me.\u201d\n\nTanub\u2019s eyes moved catlike: right, left. \u201cYes.\u201d He turned, barked an\norder into the jungle gloom, then climbed in behind Orne.\n\n\u201cWhen do we go?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cThe great sun will be down soon,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cWe can continue as soon\nas Chiranachuruso rises.\u201d\n\n\u201cChiranachuruso?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur satellite ... our moon,\u201d said Tanub.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful word,\u201d said Orne. \u201cChiranachuruso.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our tongue it means: The Limb of Victory,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cBy its light\nwe will continue.\u201d\n\nOrne turned, looked back at Tanub. \u201cDo you mean to tell me that you can\nsee by what light gets down here through those trees?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you not see?\u201d asked Tanub.\n\n\u201cNot without the headlights.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur eyes differ,\u201d said Tanub. He bent toward Orne, peered. The vertical\nslit pupils of his eyes expanded, contracted. \u201cYou are the same as the\n... others.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, on the _Delphinus_?\u201d\n\nPause. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nPresently, a greater gloom came over the jungle, bringing a sudden\nstillness to the wild life. There was a chittering commotion from the\nnatives in the trees around the sled. Tanub shifted behind Orne.\n\n\u201cWe may go now,\u201d he said. \u201cSlowly ... to stay behind my ... scouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Orne eased the sled forward around an obstructing root.\n\n\n\nSilence while they crawled ahead. Around them shapes flung themselves\nfrom vine to vine.\n\n\u201cI admired your city from the air,\u201d said Orne. \u201cIt is very beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cWhy did you land so far from it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to come down where we might destroy anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to destroy in the jungle,\u201d said Tanub.\n\n\u201cWhy do you have such a big city?\u201d asked Orne.\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cI said: Why do you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are ignorant of our ways,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cTherefore, I forgive you.\nThe city is for our race. We must breed and be born in sunlight.\nOnce\u2014long ago\u2014we used crude platforms on the tops of the trees. Now\n... only the ... wild ones do this.\u201d\n\nStetson\u2019s voice hissed in Orne\u2019s ears: _\u201cEasy on the sex line, boy.\nThat\u2019s always touchy. These creatures are oviparous. Sex glands are\napparently hidden in that long fur behind where their chins ought to\nbe.\u201d_\n\n\u201cWho controls the breeding sites controls our world,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cOnce\nthere was another city. We destroyed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there many ... wild ones?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cFewer each year,\u201d said Tanub.\n\n_\u201cThere\u2019s how they get their slaves,\u201d_ hissed Stetson.\n\n\u201cYou speak excellent Galactese,\u201d said Orne.\n\n\u201cThe High Path Chief commanded the best teacher,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cDo you,\ntoo, know many things, Orne?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I was sent here,\u201d said Orne.\n\n\u201cAre there many planets to teach?\u201d asked Tanub.\n\n\u201cVery many,\u201d said Orne. \u201cYour city\u2014I saw very tall buildings. Of what\ndo you build them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your tongue\u2014glass,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cThe engineers of the _Delphinus_\nsaid it was impossible. As you saw\u2014they are wrong.\u201d\n\n_\u201cA glass-blowing culture,\u201d_ hissed Stetson. _\u201cThat\u2019d explain a lot of\nthings.\u201d_\n\nSlowly, the disguised sled crept through the jungle. Once, a scout\nswooped down into the headlights, waved. Orne stopped on Tanub\u2019s order,\nand they waited almost ten minutes before proceeding.\n\n\u201cWild ones?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Tanub.\n\nA glowing of many lights grew visible through the giant tree trunks. It\ngrew brighter as the sled crept through the last of the jungle, emerged\nin cleared land at the edge of the city.\n\nOrne stared upward in awe. The city fluted and spiraled into the moonlit\nsky. It was a fragile appearing lacery of bridges, winking dots of\nlight. The bridges wove back and forth from building to building until\nthe entire visible network appeared one gigantic dew-glittering web.\n\n\u201cAll that with glass,\u201d murmured Orne.\n\n_\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d_ hissed Stetson.\n\nOrne touched his throat contact. _\u201cWe\u2019re just into the city clearing,\nproceeding toward the nearest building.\u201d_\n\n\u201cThis is far enough,\u201d said Tanub.\n\n\n\nOrne stopped the sled. In the moonlight, he could see armed Gienahns all\naround. The buttressed pedestal of one of the buildings loomed directly\nahead. It looked taller than had the scout cruiser in its jungle landing\ncircle.\n\nTanub leaned close to Orne\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe have not deceived you, have\nwe, Orne?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have recognized that we are not mutated members of your race.\u201d\n\nOrne swallowed. Into his ears came Stetson\u2019s voice: _\u201cBetter admit it.\u201d_\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Orne.\n\n\u201cI like you, Orne,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cYou shall be one of my slaves. You will\nteach me many things.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you capture the _Delphinus_?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cYou know that, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have one of their rifles,\u201d said Orne.\n\n\u201cYour race is no match for us, Orne ... in cunning, in strength, in the\nprowess of the mind. Your ship landed to repair its tubes. Very inferior\nceramics in those tubes.\u201d\n\nOrne turned, looked at Tanub in the dim glow of the cab light. \u201cHave you\nheard about the I-A, Tanub?\u201d\n\n\u201cI-A? What is that?\u201d There was a wary tenseness in the Gienahn\u2019s figure.\nHis mouth opened to reveal the long canines.\n\n\u201cYou took the _Delphinus_ by treachery?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cThey were simple fools,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cWe are smaller, thus they thought\nus weaker.\u201d The Mark XX\u2019s muzzle came around to center on Orne\u2019s\nstomach. \u201cYou have not answered my question. What is the I-A?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am of the I-A,\u201d said Orne. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you hidden the _Delphinus_?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the place that suits us best,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cIn all our history there\nhas never been a better place.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you plan to do with it?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cWithin a year we will have a copy with our own improvements. After\nthat\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou intend to start a war?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cIn the jungle the strong slay the weak until only the strong remain,\u201d\nsaid Tanub.\n\n\u201cAnd then the strong prey upon each other?\u201d asked Orne.\n\n\u201cThat is a quibble for women,\u201d said Tanub.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad you feel that way,\u201d said Orne. \u201cWhen two cultures meet\nlike this they tend to help each other. What have you done with the crew\nof the _Delphinus_?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are slaves,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cThose who still live. Some resisted.\nOthers objected to teaching us what we want to know.\u201d He waved the gun\nmuzzle. \u201cYou will not be that foolish, will you, Orne?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need to be,\u201d said Orne. \u201cI\u2019ve another little lesson to teach you: I\nalready know where you\u2019ve hidden the _Delphinus_.\u201d\n\n_\u201cGo, boy!\u201d_ hissed Stetson. _\u201cWhere is it?\u201d_\n\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d barked Tanub.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on your moon,\u201d said Orne. \u201cDarkside. It\u2019s on a mountain on the\ndarkside of your moon.\u201d\n\nTanub\u2019s eyes dilated, contracted. \u201cYou read minds?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe I-A has no need to read minds,\u201d said Orne. \u201cWe rely on superior\nmental prowess.\u201d\n\n_\u201cThe marines are on their way,\u201d_ hissed Stetson. _\u201cWe\u2019re coming in to\nget you. I\u2019m going to want to know how you guessed that one.\u201d_\n\n\u201cYou are a weak fool like the others,\u201d gritted Tanub.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad you formed your opinion of us by observing only the low\ngrades of the R&R,\u201d said Orne.\n\n_\u201cEasy, boy,\u201d_ hissed Stetson. _\u201cDon\u2019t pick a fight with him now.\nRemember, his race is arboreal. He\u2019s probably as strong as an ape.\u201d_\n\n\u201cI could kill you where you sit!\u201d grated Tanub.\n\n\u201cYou write finish for your entire planet if you do,\u201d said Orne. \u201cI\u2019m not\nalone. There are others listening to every word we say. There\u2019s a ship\noverhead that could split open your planet with one bomb\u2014wash it with\nmolten rock. It\u2019d run like the glass you use for your buildings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are lying!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make you an offer,\u201d said Orne. \u201cWe don\u2019t really want to\nexterminate you. We\u2019ll give you limited membership in the Galactic\nFederation until you prove you\u2019re no menace to us.\u201d\n\n_\u201cKeep talking,\u201d_ hissed Stetson. _\u201cKeep him interested.\u201d_\n\n\u201cYou dare insult me!\u201d growled Tanub.\n\n\u201cYou had better believe me,\u201d said Orne. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d\n\nStetson\u2019s voice interrupted him: _\u201cGot it, Orne! They caught the_\nDelphinus _on the ground right where you said it\u2019d be! Blew the tubes\noff it. Marines now mopping up.\u201d_\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d said Orne. \u201cWe already have recaptured the\n_Delphinus_.\u201d Tanub\u2019s eyes went instinctively skyward. \u201cExcept for the\ncaptured armament you still hold, you obviously don\u2019t have the weapons\nto meet us,\u201d continued Orne. \u201cOtherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be carrying that\nrifle off the _Delphinus_.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you speak the truth, then we shall die bravely,\u201d said Tanub.\n\n\u201cNo need for you to die,\u201d said Orne.\n\n\u201cBetter to die than be slaves,\u201d said Tanub.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need slaves,\u201d said Orne. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot take the chance that you are lying,\u201d said Tanub. \u201cI must kill\nyou now.\u201d\n\n\n\nOrne\u2019s foot rested on the air sled control pedal. He depressed it.\nInstantly, the sled shot skyward, heavy G\u2019s pressing them down into the\nseats. The gun in Tanub\u2019s hands was slammed into his lap. He struggled\nto raise it. To Orne, the weight was still only about twice that of his\nhome planet of Chargon. He reached over, took the rifle, found safety\nbelts, bound Tanub with them. Then he eased off the acceleration.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need slaves,\u201d said Orne. \u201cWe have machines to do our work.\nWe\u2019ll send experts in here, teach you people how to exploit your planet,\nhow to build good transportation facilities, show you how to mine your\nminerals, how to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what do we do in return?\u201d whispered Tanub.\n\n\u201cYou could start by teaching us how you make superior glass,\u201d said Orne.\n\u201cI certainly hope you see things our way. We really don\u2019t want to have\nto come down there and clean you out. It\u2019d be a shame to have to blast\nthat city into little pieces.\u201d\n\nTanub wilted. Presently, he said: \u201cSend me back. I will discuss this\nwith ... our council.\u201d He stared at Orne. \u201cYou I-A\u2019s are too strong. We\ndid not know.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the wardroom of Stetson\u2019s scout cruiser, the lights were low, the\nleather chairs comfortable, the green beige table set with a decanter of\nHochar brandy and two glasses.\n\nOrne lifted his glass, sipped the liquor, smacked his lips. \u201cFor a while\nthere, I thought I\u2019d never be tasting anything like this again.\u201d\n\nStetson took his own glass. \u201cComGO heard the whole thing over the\ngeneral monitor net,\u201d he said. \u201cD\u2019you know you\u2019ve been breveted to\nsenior field man?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, they\u2019ve already recognized my sterling worth,\u201d said Orne.\n\nThe wolfish grin took over Stetson\u2019s big features. \u201cSenior field men\nlast about half as long as the juniors,\u201d he said. \u201cMortality\u2019s\nterrific?\u201d\n\n\u201cI might\u2019ve known,\u201d said Orne. He took another sip of the brandy.\n\nStetson flicked on the switch of a recorder beside him. \u201cO.K. You can go\nahead any time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do you want me to start?\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, how\u2019d you spot right away where they\u2019d hidden the _Delphinus_?\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy. Tanub\u2019s word for his people was _Grazzi_. Most races call\nthemselves something meaning _The People_. But in his tongue that\u2019s\n_Ocheero_. _Grazzi_ wasn\u2019t on the translated list. I started working on\nit. The most likely answer was that it had been adopted from another\nlanguage, and meant _enemy_.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd _that_ told you where the _Delphinus_ was?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. But it fitted my hunch about these Gienahns. I\u2019d kind of felt from\nthe first minute of meeting them that they had a culture like the\nIndians of ancient Terra.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey came in like a primitive raiding party. The leader dropped right\nonto the hood of my sled. An act of bravery, no less. Counting coup, you\nsee?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he said he was High Path Chief. That wasn\u2019t on the language list,\neither. But it was easy: _Raider Chief._ There\u2019s a word in almost every\nlanguage in history that means raider and derives from a word for road,\npath or highway.\u201d\n\n\u201cHighwaymen,\u201d said Stetson.\n\n\u201cRaid itself,\u201d said Orne. \u201cAn ancient Terran language corruption of\nroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah. But where\u2019d all this translation griff put\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be impatient. Glass-blowing culture meant they were just out of\nthe primitive stage. That, we could control. Next, he said their moon\nwas _Chiranachuruso_, translated as _The Limb of Victory_. After that it\njust fell into place.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vertical-slit pupils of their eyes. Doesn\u2019t that mean anything to\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. What\u2019s it mean to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNight-hunting predator accustomed to dropping upon its victims from\nabove. No other type of creature ever has had the vertical slit. And\nTanub said himself that the _Delphinus_ was hidden in the best place in\nall of their history. History? That\u2019d be a high place. Dark, likewise.\nErgo: a high place on the darkside of their moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pie-eyed greepus,\u201d whispered Stetson.\n\nOrne grinned, said: \u201cYou probably are ... sir.\u201d\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\np. 102: [normalized] ComGo -> ComGO\np. 103: net of snakers -> sneakers\np. 105: [removed extra quote] \u201cOrne swallowed\np. 111: [added closing quote] \u201cA glass-blowing culture,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",
