    "body": "\"Call them what you like,\" said Tex Harrigan. \"Lost people or strayed,\ncrackpots or warped geniuses--I know enough of them to fill an entire\ndepartment of queer people. I've been a reporter long enough to have run\ninto quite a few of them.\"\n\n\"For example?\" I said, recognizing Harrigan's mellowness.\n\n\"Take Thaddeus McIlvaine,\" said Harrigan.\n\n\"I never heard of him.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Harrigan. \"But I knew him. He was an eccentric old\nfellow who had a modest income--enough to keep up his hobbies, which\nwere three: he played cards and chess at a tavern called Bixby's on\nNorth Clark Street; he was an amateur astronomer; and he had the fixed\nidea that there was life somewhere outside this planet and that it was\npossible to communicate with other beings--but unlike most others, he\ntried it constantly with the queer machinery he had rigged up.\n\n\"Well, now, this old fellow had a trio of cronies with whom he played on\noccasion down at Bixby's. He had no one else to confide in. He kept them\nup with his progress among the stars and his communication with other\nlife in the cosmos beyond our own, and they made a great joke out of it,\nfrom all I could gather. I suppose, because he had no one else to talk\nto, McIlvaine took it without complaint. Well, as I said, I never heard\nof him until one morning the city editor--it was old Bill Henderson\nthen--called me in and said, 'Harrigan, we just got a lead on a fellow\nnamed Thaddeus McIlvaine who claims to have discovered a new star.\nAmateur astronomer up North Clark. Find him and get a story.' So I set\nout to track him down....\"\n\n\n\nIt was a great moment for Thaddeus McIlvaine. He sat down among his\nfriends almost portentously, adjusted his spectacles, and peered over\nthem in his usual manner, half way between a querulous oldster and a\nreproachful schoolmaster.\n\n\"I've done it,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Aye, and what?\" asked Alexander testily.\n\n\"I discovered a new star.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Leopold flatly. \"A cinder in your eye.\"\n\n\"It lies just off Arcturus,\" McIlvaine went on, \"and it would appear to\nbe coming closer.\"\n\n\"Give it my love,\" said Richardson with a wry smile. \"Have you named it\nyet? Or don't the discoverers of new stars name them any more?\nMcIlvaine's Star--that's a good name for it. Hard a port of Arcturus,\nwith special displays on windy nights.\"\n\nMcIlvaine only smiled. \"It's a dark star,\" he said presently. \"It\ndoesn't have light.\" He spoke almost apologetically, as if somehow he\nhad disappointed his friends. \"I'm going to try and communicate with\nit.\"\n\n\"That's the ticket,\" said Alexander.\n\n\"Cut for deal,\" said Leopold.\n\nThat was how the news about McIlvaine's Star was received by his\ncronies. Afterward, after McIlvaine had dutifully played several games\nof euchre, Richardson conceived the idea of telephoning the _Globe_ to\nannounce McIlvaine's discovery.\n\n\n\n\"The old fellow took himself seriously,\" Harrigan went on. \"And yet he\nwas so damned mousy about it. I mean, you got the impression that he had\nbeen trying for so long that now he hardly believed in his star himself\nany longer. But there it was. He had a long, detailed story of its\ndiscovery, which was an accident, as those things usually are. They\nhappen all the time, and his story sounded convincing enough. Just the\nsame, you didn't feel that he really had anything. I took down notes, of\ncourse; that was routine. I got a picture of the old man, with never an\nidea we'd be using it.\n\n\"To tell the truth, I carried my notes around with me for a day or so\nbefore it occurred to me that it wouldn't do any harm to put a call in\nto Yerkes Observatory up in Wisconsin. So I did, and they confirmed\nMcIlvaine's Star. The _Globe_ had the story, did it up in fine style.\n\n\"It was two weeks before we heard from McIlvaine again....\"\n\n\n\nThat night McIlvaine was more than usually diffident. He was not like a\nman bearing a message of considerable importance to himself. He slipped\ninto Bixby's, got a glass of beer, and approached the table where his\nfriends sat, almost with trepidation.\n\n\"It's a nice evening for May,\" he said quietly.\n\nRichardson grunted.\n\nLeopold said, \"By the way, Mac, whatever became of that star of yours?\nThe one the papers wrote up.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said McIlvaine cautiously, \"I'm quite sure--I have got in\ntouch with them. Only,\" his brow wrinkled and furrowed, \"I can't\nunderstand their language.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Richardson with an edge to his voice, \"the thing for you to\ndo is to tell them that's your star, and they'll have to speak English\nfrom now on, so you can understand them. Why, next thing we know, you'll\nbe getting yourself a rocket or a space-ship and going over to that star\nto set yourself up as king or something.\"\n\n\"King Thaddeus the First,\" said Alexander loftily. \"All you\nstar-dwellers may kiss the royal foot.\"\n\n\"That would be unsanitary, I think,\" said McIlvaine, frowning.\n\nPoor McIlvaine! They made him the butt of their jests for over an hour\nbefore he took himself off to his quarters, where he sat himself down\nbefore his telescope and found his star once more, almost huge enough to\nblot out Arcturus, but not quite, since it was moving away from that\namber star now.\n\nMcIlvaine's star was certainly much closer to the Earth than it had\nbeen.\n\nHe tried once again to contact it with his home-made radio, and once\nagain he received a succession of strange, rhythmic noises which he\ncould not doubt were speech of some kind or other--a rasping, grating\nspeech, to be sure, utterly unlike the speech of McIlvaine's own kind.\nIt rose and fell, became impatient, urgent, despairing--McIlvaine sensed\nall this and strove mightily to understand.\n\nHe sat there for perhaps two hours when he received the distant\nimpression that someone was talking to him in his own language. But\nthere was no longer any sound on the radio. He could not understand what\nhad taken place, but in a few moments he received the clear conviction\nthat the inhabitants of his star had managed to discover the basic\nelements of his language by the simple process of reading his mind, and\nwere now prepared to talk with him.\n\nWhat manner of creatures inhabited Earth? they wished to know.\n\nMcIlvaine told them. He visualized one of his own kind and tried to put\nhim into words. It was difficult, since he could not rid himself of the\nconviction that his interlocutors might be utterly alien.\n\nThey had no conception of man and doubted man's existence on any other\nstar. There were plant-people on Venus, ant-people on Andromeda,\nsix-legged and four-armed beings which were equal parts mineral and\nvegetable on Betelguese--but nothing resembling man. \"You are evidently\nalone of your kind in the cosmos,\" said his interstellar correspondent.\n\n\"And what about you?\" cried McIlvaine with unaccustomed heat.\n\nSilence was his only answer, but presently he conceived a mental image\nwhich was remarkable for its vividness. But the image was of nothing he\nhad ever seen before--of thousands upon thousands of miniature beings,\nutterly alien to man; they resembled amphibious insects, with thin,\nelongated heads, large eyes, and antennae set upon a scaled, four-legged\nbody, with rudimentary beetle-like wings. Curiously, they seemed\nageless; he could detect no difference among them--all appeared to be\nthe same age.\n\n\"We are not, but we rejuvenate regularly,\" said the creature with whom\nhe corresponded in this strange manner.\n\nDid they have names? McIlvaine wondered.\n\n\"I am Guru,\" said the star's inhabitant. \"You are McIlvaine.\"\n\nAnd the civilization of their star?\n\nInstantly he saw in his mind's eye vast cities, which rose from beneath\na surface which appeared to bear no vegetation recognizable to any human\neye, in a terrain which seemed to be desert, of monolithic buildings,\nwhich were windowless and had openings only of sufficient size to permit\nthe free passage of its dwarfed dwellers. Within the buildings was\nevidence of a great and old civilization....\n\n\n\n\"You see, McIlvaine really believed all this. What an imagination the\nman had! Of course, the boys at Bixby's gave him a bad time; I don't\nknow how he stood it, but he did. And he always came back. Richardson\ncalled the story in; he took a special delight in deviling McIlvaine,\nand I was sent out to see the old fellow again.\n\n\"You couldn't doubt his sincerity. And yet he didn't sound touched.\"\n\n\"But, of course, that part about the insect-like dwellers of the star\ncomes straight out of Wells, doesn't it?\" I put in.\n\n\"Wells and scores of others,\" agreed Harrigan. \"Wells was probably the\nfirst writer to suggest insectivorous inhabitants on Mars; his were\nconsiderably larger, though.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, I talked with McIlvaine for quite a while. He told me all about\ntheir civilization and about his friend, Guru. You might have thought he\nwas talking about a neighbor of his I had only to step outside to meet.\n\n\"Later on, I dropped around at Bixby's and had a talk with the boys\nthere. Richardson let me in on a secret. He had decided to rig up a\nconnection to McIlvaine's machine and do a little talking to the old\nfellow, making him believe Guru was coming through in English. He meant\nto give McIlvaine a harder time than ever, and once he had him believing\neverything he planned to say, they would wait for him at Bixby's and let\nhim make a fool of himself.\n\n\"It didn't work out quite that way, however....\"\n\n\n\n\"McIlvaine, can you hear me?\"\n\nMcIlvaine started with astonishment. His mental impression of Guru\nbecame confused; the voice speaking English came clear as a bell, as if\nfrom no distance at all.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said hesitantly.\n\n\"Well, then, listen to me, listen to Guru. We have now had enough\ninformation from you to suit our ends. Within twenty-four hours, we, the\ninhabitants of Ahli, will begin a war of extermination against\nEarth....\"\n\n\"But, why?\" cried McIlvaine, astounded.\n\nThe image before his mind's eye cleared. The cold, precise features of\nGuru betrayed anger.\n\n\"There is interference,\" the thought-image informed him. \"Leave the\nmachine for a few moments, while we use the disintegrators.\"\n\nBefore he left the machine, McIlvaine had the impression of a greater\nmachine being attached to the means of communication which the\ninhabitants of his star were using to communicate with him.\n\n\n\n\"McIlvaine's story was that a few moments later there was a blinding\nflash just outside his window,\" continued Harrigan. \"There was also a\nrun of instantaneous fire from the window to his machine. When he had\ncollected his wits sufficiently, he ran outside to look. There was\nnothing there but a kind of grayish dust in a little mound--as if, as he\nput it, 'somebody had cleaned out a vacuum bag'. He went back in and\nexamined the space from the window to the machine; there were two thin\nlines of dust there, hardly perceptible, just as if something had been\nattached to the machine and led outside.\n\n\"Now the obvious supposition is naturally that it was Richardson out\nthere, and that the lines of dust from the window to the machine\nrepresented the wires he had attached to his microphone while McIlvaine\nwas at Bixby's entertaining his other two cronies, but this is fact, not\nfiction, and the point of the episode is that Richardson disappeared\nfrom that night on.\"\n\n\"You investigated, of course?\" I asked.\n\nHarrigan nodded. \"Quite a lot of us investigated. The police might have\ndone better. There was a gang war on in Chicago just at that time, and\nRichardson was nobody with any connections. His nearest relatives\nweren't anxious about anything but what they might inherit; to tell the\ntruth, his cronies at Bixby's were the only people who worried about\nhim. McIlvaine as much as the rest of them.\n\n\"Oh, they gave the old man a hard time, all right. They went through his\nhouse with a fine-toothed comb. They dug up his yard, his cellar, and\ngenerally put him through it, figuring he was a natural to hang a murder\nrap on. But there was just nothing to be found, and they couldn't\nmanufacture evidence when there was nothing to show that McIlvaine ever\nknew that Richardson planned to have a little fun with him.\n\n\"And no one had seen Richardson there. There was nothing but McIlvaine's\nword that he had heard what he said he heard. He needn't have\nvolunteered that, but he did. After the police had finished with him,\nthey wrote him off as a harmless nut. But the question of what happened\nto Richardson wasn't solved from that day to this.\"\n\n\"People have been known to walk out of their lives,\" I said. \"And never\ncome back.\"\n\n\"Oh, sometimes they do. Richardson didn't. Besides, if he walked out of\nhis life here, he did so without more than the clothing he had on. So\nmuch was missing from his effects, nothing more.\"\n\n\"And McIlvaine?\"\n\nHarrigan smiled thinly. \"He carried on. You couldn't expect him to do\nanything less. After all, he had worked most of his life trying to\ncommunicate with the worlds outside, and he had no intention of\nresigning his contact, no matter how much Richardson's disappearance\nupset him. For a while he believed that Guru had actually disintegrated\nRichardson; he offered that explanation, but by that time the dust had\nvanished, and he was laughed out of face. So he went back to the machine\nand Guru and the little excursions to Bixby's....\"\n\n\n\n\"What's the latest word from that star of yours?\" asked Leopold, when\nMcIlvaine came in.\n\n\"They want to rejuvenate me,\" said McIlvaine, with a certain shy\npleasure.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Alexander sourly.\n\n\"They say they can make me young again. Like them up there. They never\ndie. They just live so long, and then they rejuvenate, they begin all\nover. It's some kind of a process they have.\"\n\n\"And I suppose they're planning to come down and fetch you up there and\ngive you the works, is that it?\" asked Alexander.\n\n\"Well, no,\" answered McIlvaine. \"Guru says there's no need for that--it\ncan be done through the machine; they can work it like the\ndisintegrators; it puts you back to thirty or twenty or wherever you\nlike.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like to be twenty-five myself again,\" admitted Leopold.\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Mac,\" said Alexander. \"You go ahead and try it;\nthen come back and let us know how it works. If it does, we'll all sit\nin.\"\n\n\"Better make your will first, though, just in case.\"\n\n\"Oh, I did. This afternoon.\"\n\nLeopold choked back a snicker. \"Don't take this thing too seriously,\nMac. After all, we're short one of us now. We'd hate to lose you, too.\"\n\nMcIlvaine was touched. \"Oh, I wouldn't change,\" he hastened to assure\nhis friends. \"I'd just be younger, that's all. They'll just work on me\nthrough the machine, and over-night I'll be rejuvenated.\"\n\n\"That's certainly a little trick that's got it all over monkey glands,\"\nconceded Alexander, grinning.\n\n\"Those little bugs on that star of yours have made scientific progress,\nI'd say,\" said Leopold.\n\n\"They're not bugs,\" said McIlvaine with faint indignation. \"They're\npeople, maybe not just like you and me, but they're people just the\nsame.\"\n\nHe went home that night filled with anticipation. He had done just what\nhe had promised himself he would do, arranging everything for his\nrejuvenation. Guru had been astonished to learn that people on Earth\nsimply died when there was no necessity of doing so; he had made the\noffer to rejuvenate McIlvaine himself.\n\nMcIlvaine sat down to his machine and turned the complex knobs until he\nwas en rapport with his dark star. He waited for a long time, it seemed,\nbefore he knew his contact had been closed. Guru came through.\n\n\"Are you ready, McIlvaine?\" he asked soundlessly.\n\n\"Yes. All ready,\" said McIlvaine, trembling with eagerness.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed now. It will take several hours,\" said Guru.\n\n\"I'm not alarmed,\" answered McIlvaine.\n\nAnd indeed he was not; he was filled with an exhilaration akin to\nmysticism, and he sat waiting for what he was certain must be the\nexperience above all others in his prosaic existence.\n\n\n\n\"McIlvaine's disappearance coming so close on Richardson's gave us a\nbeautiful story,\" said Harrigan. \"The only trouble was, it wasn't new\nwhen the _Globe_ got around to it. We had lost our informant in\nRichardson; it never occurred to Alexander or Leopold to telephone us or\nanyone about McIlvaine's unaccountable absence from Bixby's. Finally,\nLeopold went over to McIlvaine's house to find out whether the old\nfellow was sick.\n\n\"A young fellow opened up.\n\n\"'Where's McIlvaine?' Leopold asked.\n\n\"'I'm McIlvaine,' the young fellow answered.\n\n\"'Thaddeus McIlvaine,' Leopold explained.\n\n\"'That's my name,' was the only answer he got.\n\n\"'I mean the Thaddeus McIlvaine who used to play cards with us over at\nBixby's,' said Leopold.\n\n\"He shook his head. 'Sorry, you must be looking for someone else.'\n\n\"'What're you doing here?' Leopold asked then.\n\n\"'Why, I inherited what my uncle left,' said the young fellow.\n\n\"And, sure enough, when Leopold talked to me and persuaded me to go\naround with him to McIlvaine's lawyer, we found that the old fellow had\nmade a will and left everything to his nephew, a namesake. The\nstipulations were clear enough; among them was the express wish that if\nanything happened to him, the elder Thaddeus McIlvaine, of no matter\nwhat nature, but particularly something allowing a reasonable doubt of\nhis death, the nephew was still to be permitted to take immediate\npossession of the property and effects.\"\n\n\"Of course, you called on the nephew,\" I said.\n\nHarrigan nodded. \"Sure. That was the indicated course, in any event. It\nwas routine for both the press and the police. There was nothing\nsuspicious about his story; it was straightforward enough, except for\none or two little details. He never did give us any precise address; he\njust mentioned Detroit once. I called up a friend on one of the papers\nthere and put him up to looking up Thaddeus McIlvaine; the only young\nman of that name he could find appeared to be the same man as the\npresent inhabitant's uncle, though the description fit pretty well.\"\n\n\"There was a resemblance, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure. One could have imagined that old Thaddeus McIlvaine had\nlooked somewhat like his nephew when he himself was a young man. But\ndon't let the old man's rigmarole about rejuvenation make too deep an\nimpression on you. The first thing the young fellow did was to get rid\nof that machine of his uncle's. Can you imagine his uncle having done\nsomething like that?\"\n\n\n\nI shook my head, but I could not help thinking what an ironic thing it\nwould have been if there had been something to McIlvaine's story, and in\nthe process to which he had been subjected from out of space he had not\nbeen rejuvenated so much as just sent back in time, in which case he\nwould have no memory of the machine nor of the use to which it had been\nput. It would have been as ironic for the inhabitants of McIlvaine's\nstar, too; they would doubtless have looked forward to keeping this\ncontact with Earth open and failed to realize that McIlvaine's\nconstruction differed appreciably from theirs.\n\n\"He virtually junked it. Said he had no idea what it could be used for,\nand didn't know how to operate it.\"\n\n\"And the telescope?\"\n\n\"Oh, he kept that. He said he had some interest in astronomy and meant\nto develop that if time permitted.\"\n\n\"So much ran in the family, then.\"\n\n\"Yes. More than that. Old McIlvaine had a trick of seeming shy and\nself-conscious. So did this nephew of his. Wherever he came from, his\norigins must have been backward. I suspect that he was ashamed of them,\nand if I had to guess, I'd put him in the Kentucky hill-country or the\nOzarks. Modern concepts seemed to be pretty well too much for him, and\nhis thinking would have been considerably more natural at the turn of\nthe century.\n\n\"I had to see him several times. The police chivvied him a little, but\nnot much; he was so obviously innocent of everything that there was\nnothing for them in him. And the search for the old man didn't last\nlong; no one had seen him after that last night at Bixby's, and, since\neveryone had already long since concluded that he was mentally a little\noff center, it was easy to conclude that he had wandered away somewhere,\nprobably an amnesiac. That he might have anticipated that is indicated\nin the hasty preparation of his will, which came out of the blue, said\nBarnevall, who drew it up for him.\n\n\"I felt sorry for him.\"\n\n\"For whom?\"\n\n\"The nephew. He seemed so lost, you know--like a man who wanted to\nremember something, but couldn't. I noticed that several times when I\ntried to talk to him; I had the feeling each time that there was\nsomething he wanted desperately to say, it hovered always on the rim of\nhis awareness, but somehow there was no bridge to it, no clue to put it\ninto words. He tried so hard for something he couldn't put his finger\non.\"\n\n\"What became of him?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's still around. I think he found a job somewhere. As a matter of\nfact, I saw him just the other evening. He had apparently just come from\nwork and he was standing in front of Bixby's with his face pressed to\nthe window looking in. I came up nearby and watched him. Leopold and\nAlexander were sitting inside--a couple of lonely old men looking out.\nAnd a lonely young man looking in. There was something in McIlvaine's\nface--that same thing I had noticed so often before, a kind of\nexpression that seemed to say there was something he ought to know,\nsomething he ought to remember, to do, to say, but there was no way in\nwhich he could reach back to it.\"\n\n\"Or forward,\" I said with a wry smile.\n\n\"As you like,\" said Harrigan. \"Pour me another, will you?\"\n\nI did and he took it.\n\n\"That poor devil!\" he muttered. \"He'd be happier if he could only go\nback where he came from.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't we all?\" I asked. \"But nobody ever goes home again. Perhaps\nMcIlvaine never had a home like that.\"\n\n\"You'd have thought so if you could have seen his face looking in at\nLeopold and Alexander. Oh, it may have been a trick of the streetlight\nthere, it may have been my imagination. But it sticks to my memory, and\nI keep thinking how alike the two were--old McIlvaine trying so\ndesperately to find someone who could believe him, and his nephew now\ntrying just as hard to find someone to accept him or a place he could\naccept on the only terms he knows.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
