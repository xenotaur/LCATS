    "body": "The city was enchanted. It was a colossal music box blaring forth a\nthousand chants of victory. It was a rainbow torn down from the sky and\npoured over the earth. It was a magic nursery through which eager-eyed\nchildren swarmed to behold a sparkling new toy.\n\nThree spacemen, three conquerors-to-be, sat stiffly in the back seat\nof a blue-bannered convertible. The car moved snail-like toward the\nCapitol steps, escorted by a hundred bands, eight hundred flowered\nfloats, and ten thousand marching men.\n\nIn its front seat, standing, waving to the crowd, was Captain George\nEverson. Everson--the legless man. Everson--the bronzed giant whose\nfirst rocketship had exploded at take-off, and yet who had lived to\nwalk on artificial legs, to build a second rocket, and to infect all\nthe world with his square-jawed determination.\n\nIt was barely eight o'clock on this April morning of the year 1982, yet\nthe onslaught against the spacemen had begun. Confetti rained on them.\nBreeze-filled flags dazzled them. Band music deafened them. The flow\nof shouting spectators dizzied them. It was a day when holiday hats\nand mathematicians' formulae, roasted peanuts and ancient dreams were\nblended in a fury of joy.\n\nThe magic wand that had enchanted the city was Everson's _Lunar Lady_.\nAnd it _was_ like a wand--1,000 tons of it, poised on the take-off\nfield on the outskirts of the city, its needle-point nose turned\nskyward and shining silver in the morning sunlight.\n\nTonight, at sunset, when the city was saturated with speeches and music\nand popcorn and prayer, the great rocket would rumble and belch flame\nand rise. Mankind would begin its first flight to the moon!\n\nSo it seemed that the people of all the earth were basking in joy and\nhope, every man, woman and child--with one exception.\n\n\n\nJeffrey Simon rose from his bed, awakened by the rhythm of march music\noutside his small apartment. He shuffled sleepily to a window. He\nblinked at the array of flags and bunting that lined the street.\n\nThe music became louder.\n\nHe ran a shaky, withered hand over his wizened face, brushed stringy\nwhite hair back from his forehead. His lips curved in a grim\nhalf-smile.\n\n\"It's starting,\" he murmured, \"--the day that should have been yours.\"\n\nHe realized that he was talking to himself again. But although he was\nonly fifty-six, talking aloud seemed natural to him. It not only eased\nhis loneliness; it also helped him to clarify his muddled thoughts.\n\n\"Today is your last chance. Not tomorrow or the next day. It _has_ to\nbe today.\"\n\nThe thump-thump of a base drum was like a gigantic heart-beat shaking\nall the land. The blare of trumpets was a victory song, strong enough\nto live in the mind of a man forever, strong enough to silence forever\nthe voices of fear and loneliness that might haunt a spaceman.\n\n\"That's the music,\" Jeffrey Simon muttered, \"that should have been\nyours.\"\n\nA crimson-lettered banner said: EVERSON--THE FIRST.\n\nWhat a mockery those words were! It was like worshiping an evil,\nfalse-faced goddess. The illusion should and must be destroyed.\n\nHe jerked erect. He must move quickly. He must put an end to this\ncosmic lie.\n\nHe dressed in a freshly-cleaned, single-breasted tweed suit. His tie\nwas hastily knotted. There was no time for breakfast.\n\nHe strode to a drawer of his bureau, yanked it open, dug away a layer\nof under-clothing. He smiled as he beheld two objects.\n\nHis hands moved gently. His hands were like those of a florist\narranging a garland of delicate blossoms. They were like the hands of a\nsurgeon fearful of a fatal error. They were like the hands of a father\nupon his first-born.\n\nHe picked up the stone.\n\nIt was a bright, phosphorescent green, mottled with flecks of gold and\nno larger than an apple. Its glow seemed to fill all the room. Jeffrey\nremembered the cave at the base of Luna's Mount Pico from where he'd\nchipped it. The cave's eerie glow had almost seemed alive, quivering\nand pulsing with alien energy. Jeffrey, in his space-suit and half\nblinded, had staggered when he left with his specimen.\n\nNext, he touched the photograph.\n\nIt was a moment of eternity captured long ago and still imprisoned\nin a wrinkled, yellowed paper. On it was the rocket, the _Marilyn_,\nwhich had been his home for fifteen years. Behind it, on a rise in the\npock-marked Lunar terrain, was one of the launching stations which\nhad never been used. In the background loomed the nightmarish Tenerife\nMountains. And hovering above all in a sky of black velvet was a\nshining, blue-green ball--the earth.\n\nCarefully, Jeffrey placed the photograph in a large envelope and slid\nit, with the stone, into his coat's inner pocket.\n\n\"They'll believe now,\" he murmured. \"They ignored the letters, the\ntelegrams. Now, with proof, they'll believe. They'll learn what is a\nlie and what is the truth. They'll learn who was _really_ first.\"\n\nA moment later he was on the street, struggling to filter through the\ncrowd. For a few seconds he knew terror, because those in the crowd\nhad surrendered all individuality. They had become a single, automatic\nentity, hypnotized by the tapestry of color and sound and responding\nto it alone. The crowd closed in upon him like the tentacles of an\noctopus, imprisoning him and thrusting him forward and back.\n\nAt last, panting, he broke free. He found a side street--one that would\nnot be invaded by the parade. He walked swiftly. Then, although breath\ncame hard, he ran.\n\n\n\nCarved above the entrance of the huge stone building were the words:\n\n                         UNITED STATES BUREAU\n                           OF INTERPLANETARY\n                               RESEARCH\n\nJeffrey stopped to catch his breath. How many of his letters had\npassed over that mountainous series of steps? How many, like those to\nCongress, to the Pentagon and to the President, had been crumpled,\ntorn, tossed into waste baskets?\n\nIt didn't matter. He was doing now what he should have done a month\nago--appearing in person with his proof.\n\nHe lumbered up the stone steps. His watery eyes widened at the bright\nmurals in the vast foyer--murals of stars and planets, of rockets and\nspacemen, all centered about a gigantic and symbolic pair of human\nhands reaching upward.\n\nJeffrey squinted down the white, clean, cool halls.\n\nSo this was where spacemen of today lived, studied, worked,\nexperimented. How different from that battered quonset hut in the hot,\nwind-burnt New Mexican desert.\n\n\"May I help you, sir?\"\n\nThe voice snapped him back to reality.\n\nHe turned and saw a young man seated at a desk a short distance away.\nThe man was sleepy-eyed, with black, close-cropped hair and ears that\nwere too big. On the desk was a placard that said: _Officer of The Day:\nLieutenant Andrews_.\n\nThe lieutenant drummed his fingers on the desk. \"Speak up, old timer.\nWhat is it? If you want information on today's flight, just help\nyourself to these folders.\"\n\n\"No, no.\" Jeffrey walked up to the desk, brushed away the folders.\n\"I--I want to see someone in authority. There's something I have to\ntell them.\"\n\n\"I'm in charge. Go ahead and tell it to me.\"\n\nJeffrey trembled. \"It's going to sound crazy. You might not believe--\"\n\n\"Go ahead and tell it. Then I'll decide whether to believe.\"\n\nConfidence came to Jeffrey. He touched the reassuring bulge of the\nstone and the photograph in his pocket. Then he began to speak.\n\n\"Well, you've read how things were back in 1957. The world cut in half.\nCommunism on one side, Democracy on the other. Both sides threatening\nthe other. Both building faster and faster jets and bigger and bigger\nH-bombs. People felt like they were walking on tight-ropes.\n\n\"In August of '57 the Russians announced that they had the biggest\nH-bomb ever made. The President and his cabinet and the top brass met.\nThe Army Chief of Staff was already on record in saying there was no\nperfect defense against an H-bomb attack. Radar nets, anti-aircraft\nand fighter planes would take care of a lot of attacking bombers\nor missiles, but some would probably get through. There had to be\nsomething else--something as daring as the first A-bomb project back in\nWorld War II.\n\n\"The answer was obvious: a _manned_ artificial satellite.\"\n\nThe lieutenant stiffened. He made a sucking noise with his lips.\n\n\"Yep,\" Jeffrey continued, \"a manned satellite. Our scientists had\ndeveloped the tiny, unmanned 'mouse.' A full-scale version was\ntougher--but possible.\n\n\"And a nation in control of such a satellite would watch over all\nthe world. From its near-zero gravity it could launch guided atomic\nmissiles to any point on the earth.\"\n\nJeffrey cleared his throat. His listener was still attentive.\n\n\"So Project Pandora began. Like the Manhattan Project, it was top\nsecret, because we didn't want the Russians to start like crazy on\ntheir own Project. I never learned how many men were involved--probably\nabout 100,000. But all except maybe a hundred or so thought they were\nworking on new types of jets or fuels.\n\n\"A new town--Pandora City--sprang up in New Mexico for general\nresearch. Really top secret stuff, like the construction of our\nrockets, was handled in Hell Canyon, which probably still isn't on your\nmaps. You couldn't get there except by cargo-carrying helicopter.\n\n\"I was a guided missile man transferred from Point Mugu to the Canyon.\nEntering that hell-hole was like being sentenced for life. We had our\nmovies and beer, but the sun and mountains were still there. I used to\nlook at those mountains and wonder if I dared try to escape. Then I\nthought of the desert on the other side. There _was_ no escape--except\nthrough death or by finishing the damn project.\n\n\"By the fall of '58 we had our fuel. Dilute monatomic\nhydrogen--powerful as the guts of an H-bomb, but controllable, suitable\nfor atomic engines. Powered with that fuel, a rocket could rip through\nthe old seven-mile-a-second barrier like a knife cutting through tissue\npaper.\n\n\"Then a new question came up. Was the artificial satellite the ideal\nsolution to our problem? Even at a height of a thousand miles, it could\nbe visible to Russian astronomers. Russian knowledge of our secret\ncould start off a Third World War. And, if the Russians developed their\nown guided missile program, the satellite might be vulnerable.\n\n\"We'd developed an alloy of rare earths for our jet tubes, so there was\nno reason why we couldn't hit the moon direct. A Lunar station could be\ncamouflaged, and launching platforms for missiles could be scattered.\nMost important, the moon would give us utter secrecy.\"\n\nJeffrey's voice trailed. A cloud of memory seemed to drift before his\nvision. \"And--and I guess there was something else, too. We didn't want\nto stop with just a satellite. We had the power to take space by the\nnose and pull it around like a whipped dog. The first men to leave our\nplanet--think of those words. The first, the very first. The thought\nmakes you a little drunk.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"The President, his cabinet, the top brass okayed our ideas.\nSo the moon it was!\"\n\n\n\nLieutenant Andrews rose, his mouth a tight, white line.\n\n\"Afraid we'll have to call it a day,\" he muttered. \"It's time for me to\ngo off duty. Sorry.\"\n\n\"But--but your relief isn't here. You can't--\"\n\n\"Sorry.\" The man's gaze avoided Jeffrey's face.\n\nHe moved swiftly, his tall body easing around the desk, then striding\ndown the hall.\n\nJeffrey was like a statue, an absurd, bulging-eyed statue with right\nhand still raised in a climactic, melodramatic gesture.\n\n\"But I haven't finished!\" he cried. \"You haven't heard--\"\n\nThe lieutenant marched away, oblivious to Jeffrey's pleading voice.\nAbruptly, his bright uniform disappeared into one of the labyrinth's\nmany rooms.\n\nJeffrey was a fragile leaf mauled by winds of desperation. He dug\nfuriously into his coat's inner pocket.\n\n\"You haven't seen my proof!\" he screamed.\n\nThere was no reply save the cold, hollow, hundred-tongued echo of his\nown words.\n\nJeffrey looked down at his outstretched hands. They were holding the\nfaded photograph and the shining stone, offering them to the silence.\n\n\n\nOutside, the city was like a merry-go-round whirling faster and faster.\nMusic had swelled to a dizzying crescendo. Colors were brighter in the\nnoon sunlight. Voices were louder, prayers stronger.\n\n\"Ten to one they don't make it,\" said a rat-faced man. \"I'll take _all_\nbets.\"\n\n\"They will not be alone,\" the solemn man in the black robe intoned to\nhis congregation. \"For yea, though I walk through the valley of the\nshadow of death....\"\n\n\"Why must Daddy go up into the sky, Mama? Why?\" asked the child.\n\n\"He's going to be a pioneer, dear. He's going to be one of the first to\ngo to the moon.\"\n\n\"But why, Mama? Why?\"\n\nThe bearded man shouted, \"The wrath of God will fall upon us and upon\nour children and our children's children. Man was not meant--\"\n\n\"We have our Marco Polo, our Columbus, our Wright Brothers and our\nLindbergh. Now, by the grace of God, we have our George Everson!\"\n\n\"Step right up, folks! Get your souvenir programs here! And don't\nforget your dark glasses for the take-off. Special today--only one\ndollar!\"\n\n\n\nA clock struck one.\n\n\"No,\" said the stiffly polite girl, \"the city editor isn't in. No, our\nreporters are covering the flight. Sorry.\"\n\nA clock struck two.\n\n\"Sorry.\"\n\nJeffrey sighed. What else was there? The Research Bureau. The\nDepartment of Defense, the Pentagon. _The Times_, _The Herald_, _The\nPost_. He hadn't wanted to take his story to the newspapers, but they\nhad given him a last, futile hope. Now, even they had refused to listen.\n\nThere was still _The Mirror_. The twilight news. The love nests, the\nexpos\u00c3\u00a9s, the screaming headlines that most papers were saving for the\nsecond coming of Christ.\n\nJeffrey found himself walking up dark, thinly carpeted stairs, pushing\na faded swinging door. Then someone was leading him forward. Sounds of\nclacking typewriters and rustling papers filled the air.\n\nThe photograph and the moon-stone were in his hands. He was thrusting\nthem forward.\n\n\"This is my proof,\" he mumbled automatically.\n\nFor a long time his surroundings were like the terrain in a dimly\nremembered dream. Then hands helped him into a chair.\n\nA deep voice grunted at him. \"Okay, proof of what?\"\n\nJeffrey blinked. His brain fought to break through the wall of\nweariness that enclosed it. He saw that the man before him was\nmiddle-aged, balding, small-eyed. His trace of a smile was not\nunpleasant.\n\n\"What's it all about, fellow?\" the man asked, leaning back in his chair.\n\n_Thank you, God_, thought Jeffrey, _that I have another chance._\n\nHe began again. 1957, the H-bomb, Project Pandora. Lord, if he could\nonly show this man the images that still hung in his memory!\n\nBut how could you capture the dizzying blackness of space, the hypnotic\nsilver of stars, and recreate their magic in mere words? How feeble\nwere words. They were like broken fingers trying to carry sand.\n\nNevertheless, the man listened. Jeffrey came to the words, \"So the moon\nit was!\" And even then the man said nothing. Jeffrey went on:\n\n\"Our first rocket was ready by the summer of '59. We named it the\n_Marilyn_--after Marilyn Monroe, the top glamour gal of those days.\nAnd I was in the ship's first crew.\n\n\"Our take-off wasn't like this circus today. No music, no speeches, no\nparades. We had a shot of brandy in the morning. We shook hands with\nour friends and puffed on cigarettes and the C.O. said a prayer. Then\nwe took off.\"\n\nJeffrey weighed words and memories in his mind. \"It'd take me a year to\ntell about how space looks and how the moon is; and how you feel when\nall the things you love are in a cloud-wrapped ball 240,000 miles away.\nOr how it feels to see your buddies slip through the paper-thin crust\nthat covers parts of the moon and go down into nothingness, just as if\nthe hand of God wiped them out of the universe.\n\n\"Anyway, we hit the moon. The ship stayed long enough for us to build\na dome. Then we split the crew in half. Five stayed, the rest shuttled\nback to Earth for more supplies. Three months later the second rocket,\nthe _June Randy_, was ready, and life got a little easier. We began\nto get an occasional case of beer and mail from home. Our families\nthought they were writing to Pandora City. To think that those little\nthree-cent letters would go all the way to Luna would have seemed a\nlunatic's dream to them.\n\n\"By the summer of '61 Project Pandora was completed. We had two domes\nand four launching stations, each a hundred miles apart. The missiles\non the launching platforms were like those beds of nails the yogis are\nsupposed to lie on--only a hundred times bigger. And each nail was a\nuranium-lithium-tritium-headed rocket.\n\n\"1961 slipped by, and '62 and '63. There were a few aborted revolutions\non earth, a few moments of tension, but no war.\"\n\nA veil of loneliness seemed to fall over his vision, separating him\nfrom his listener.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" the man prompted him.\n\n\"Well, new faces appeared in our crews. The older fellows were given\nmemory-washes so they wouldn't start blabbing when they returned to\nEarth. Psychiatry was pretty primitive in those days. The treatment\nwasn't much more than hypnosis, creating an artificial psychic block in\ntheir minds. After a while, it seemed like men were coming and going\nlike figures on a treadmill--but, me, I stayed on.\"\n\n\"You stayed on? Why?\"\n\nJeffrey thought for an instant. \"Because there were two kinds of\nloneliness for us. One was being on the moon, in silence and emptiness.\nThe other was being on Earth, in the midst of life and knowing the\nbiggest secret in the world and not being able to talk about it. And of\nthe two kinds of loneliness, to me, the last was the worst. So I stayed\non the _Marilyn_.\"\n\n\n\nJeffrey tried to keep his voice calm, his manner confident.\n\n\"Then came the Russian Revolution of '74, the rise of democracy behind\nthe crumbling Iron Curtain. The rest of the world watched and waited.\nWe kept those launching platforms ready--just in case. But by '76,\nthere was no doubt about it. Communism was over and done. The world was\nat peace.\n\n\"And with the arrival of peace, man's energies had to be directed into\nnew channels. Till now, the government had quietly discouraged any talk\nabout space flight. But now man craved adventure. Newspapers and public\nopinion began to beat the drum for that first flight to the moon.\"\n\nHe chuckled softly. \"The President must have been tearing his hair out.\nWhat the hell was he going to do with Project Pandora? The Russians\nmustn't know that for fifteen years our missiles had been ready to\nblast them to eternity. The old hates had been buried. They couldn't be\nallowed to rise again.\n\n\"So Project Pandora became Project Garbage. The domes and platforms\nwere dismantled and carried back to Pandora City. The moon was the\nbiggest garbage dump in the Solar System, but it had to be cleaned up\nto the last beer can and cigarette butt. It had to become virgin again,\nready to receive what Earth would later call the first pioneers of\nspace. And it was then, when discipline was low, that I smuggled out\nthe moon-stone and the photo.\n\n\"Everybody got the memory-wash--from the President on down. I was a\ncivilian again with a nice pension. For the first couple of years I\ncouldn't remember a thing. I only knew I'd done secret work for the\ngovernment. I'd look at my photo and stone and wonder where I got them.\n\n\"But gradually my memory came back. Maybe it was because of the photo,\nor maybe because I'd been on Luna and the _Marilyn_ so much longer than\nthe others.\n\n\"Last year I got mad when Everson announced plans to hit the moon.\nHis name was in headlines every day. He was becoming a hero without\neven leaving the ground. And there were a hundred men whose bodies were\nalready lost on Luna. They were the real heroes, the real pioneers.\nThis celebration today--it's a mockery. I want the world to know the\ntruth.\"\n\n\n\nFor the space of a minute the small-eyed man was silent. His fingers\ntoyed with the stone and the photograph.\n\nFinally he murmured, \"Suppose I publish your story. How much do you\nwant for it?\"\n\nTo Jeffrey, the words were like April sunshine streaking into a\ncobwebbed winter attic.\n\n\"You--you want to use the story? You believe me?\"\n\n\"I didn't say I believe it. I don't give a damn whether it's true or\nnot. My job is to sell newspapers. I asked how much you want for it.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Jeffrey said softly.\n\nThe small-eyed man grunted. \"We could flood the city with the afternoon\nedition. People are buying anything with a moon angle. The Russians\nwouldn't shout for joy, but there shouldn't be any harm done at this\nlate date.\"\n\nHis eyes brightened. \"We might get away with it. We've got your stone.\nWe could demand that Everson locate the place where you got it and\neither prove or disprove your story. Why, that'd be good for months!\"\n\nHe laughed. \"What a damper we'll put on _this_ celebration! We'll make\nthe city seem like a morgue. It's a dirty, lousy trick, but by God\nit'll sell papers!\"\n\nJeffrey leaned forward, squinting. \"A dirty, lousy trick? What do you\nmean?\"\n\n\"Skip it.\" The man's enthusiasm was rising. He was like fizzing soda in\na thumb-stoppered, shaken bottle. \"We got to get this story in print.\nHey, Marty! Get the dicto-typer over here! I've been waiting all my\nlife to yell stop those presses. Marty! _Stop those goddamn presses!_\"\n\n\"What did you mean?\" Jeffrey insisted. \"How can telling people the\ntruth be a dirty, lousy trick?\"\n\nThe small-eyed man laughed again. \"You don't think folks'll _like_ this\nstory, do you? You don't think they'll feel like celebrating when they\nread this, do you? It's a cinch they won't start cheering _you_ for\nwhat you did almost twenty years ago! Say, wait'll Everson sees that\nmoon pic plastered on my front page. _There's_ an angle! A pic of\nEverson's expression! Hey, Marty! Get me--\"\n\n\n\nRestlessly, Jeffrey rose and shuffled to a window. One of the city's\nmyriad parades, like a battalion of colored ants, was streaming down\nthe street.\n\nThe small-eyed man yelled, \"Come on, let's have that story again! This\ntime it's for publication.\"\n\nJeffrey didn't answer. Odd thoughts were stirring in deep recesses of\nhis mind.\n\n\"Come on! Let's have that story!\"\n\nJeffrey stared out the window, a far-away gaze in his eyes. \"Do--do\nyou suppose I was the only one who remembered? There must be others. I\ncouldn't be the only one.\"\n\n\"Sure, there could be others--if your yarn is true. Maybe they've tried\nto tell and nobody believed 'em. Or maybe they're keeping quiet. Maybe\nthey don't want to make dopes out of Everson and his men. Maybe they\nwant to keep 'em heroes. Now, gimme that story!\" He flicked a switch on\nthe dicto-typer.\n\nWords echoed in Jeffrey's brain. _Maybe they don't want to make dopes\nout of Everson and his men. Maybe they want to keep 'em heroes. It's\na cinch they won't start cheering you for what you did almost twenty\nyears ago._\n\nThe world has need of heroes, he thought. There's Luna, and then there\nare Venus and Mars and Jupiter and all the others; and, always, there\nare the stars. And, between, there are miles and years of darkness and\nloneliness, and courage is a candle flame too easily extinguished.\nMankind will need songs of daring and tales of heroes and signposts to\nguide the way to infinity. You can't make heroes out of men whose very\nnames are forgotten. You can't make heroes out of tired old bones.\n\nJeffrey frowned as the hum of presses echoed in his ears.\n\nThe great headlines would descend upon the enchanted city like a black\ntidal wave. They would swirl through the streets, devour the bright\ncolor, absorb the gay sound, suck the joy into dark waters of doubt and\nsuspicion.\n\nThe small-eyed man was shouting at him. He did not hear.\n\n_After all_, Jeffrey told himself, _this is for you. It's not for\nEverson and his men, really. It's for the pioneers, for those who dare\nto be first. The eyes are not on you, and the voices do not speak to\nyou. Yet all this, really, is for you--for you were the first. Would\nyou destroy this day that is yours?_\n\nA voice was swearing at him.\n\nWhat a day it was! Why, it must be the greatest in the history of\nEarth. It was a day for all history books everywhere, always. It was a\nshame that the minutes were piling one upon the other so rapidly. How\nwonderful if they could be bottled and sealed like sweet perfume, to be\ndispensed slowly, a scent a month, a drop a year.\n\nHands were tugging at his arm. He shook himself free. He turned back to\nthe desk, seized the moon-stone and the photograph, replaced them in\nhis pocket.\n\nSilently, head high, he strode past the naked, astonished faces.\n\n\n\nDusk. A silence blanketed the take-off field. The seconds hung in the\nair like bits of fire and ice.\n\nCaptain George Everson, the man with no legs, waved to the multitude\nas he entered his silver rocket.\n\nPresently there was a sound of thunder, and the land trembled. Flame\nbelched from the stern of the _Lunar Lady_. Slowly, the rocket began to\nrise. The multitude drew back, like frightened red ghosts in the fiery\nglare from the grumbling jets.\n\nA greater avalanche of flame spewed from the rocket. A furnace-hot wind\nshrilled over the field, lashing at hair and clothing, at banner and\nflag.\n\nAnd suddenly the _Lunar Lady_ was gone. It was a needle of fire high in\nthe twilight sky, a vanishing target for a million narrowed eyes.\n\nA hushed, reverent murmur rose from the field.\n\nA small girl in a pink party dress tugged at her mother's skirt.\n\n\"Look, Mommy,\" she whispered. \"Look at that funny old man. He keeps\nsaying, 'This is for you,' and he's crying and laughing at the same\ntime!\"\n",
