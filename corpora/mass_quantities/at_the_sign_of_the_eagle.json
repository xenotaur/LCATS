    "body": "\u201cWell, what do you think of them, Molly?\u201d said Sir Duke Lawless to his\nwife, his eyes resting with some amusement on a big man and a little one\ntalking to Lord Hampstead.\n\n\u201cThe little man is affected, gauche, and servile. The big one\npicturesque and superior in a raw kind of way. He wishes to be rude\nto some one, and is disappointed because, just at the moment, Lord\nHampstead is too polite to give him his cue. A dangerous person in a\ndrawing-room, I should think; but interesting. You are a bold man to\nbring them here, Duke. Is it not awkward for our host?\u201d\n\n\u201cHampstead did it with his eyes open. Besides, there is business behind\nit--railways, mines, and all that; and Hampstead\u2019s nephew is going to\nthe States fortune-hunting. Do you see?\u201d\n\nLady Lawless lifted her eyebrows. \u201c\u2018To what base uses are we come,\nHoratio!\u2019 You invite me to dinner and--\u2018I\u2019ll fix things up right.\u2019 That\nis the proper phrase, for I have heard you use it. Status for dollars.\nIsn\u2019t it low? I know you do not mean what you say, Duke.\u201d\n\nSir Duke\u2019s eyes were playing on the men with a puzzled expression, as\nthough trying to read the subject of their conversation; and he did not\nreply immediately. Soon, however, he turned and looked down at his wife\ngenially, and said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s about it, I suppose. But really there\nis nothing unusual in this, so far as Mr. John Vandewaters is concerned,\nfor in his own country he travels \u2018the parlours of the Four Hundred,\u2019\nand is considered \u2018a very elegant gentleman.\u2019 We must respect a man\naccording to the place he holds in his own community. Besides, as you\nsuggest, Mr. Vandewaters is interesting. I might go further, and say\nthat he is a very good fellow indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be asking him down to Craigruie next,\u201d said Lady Lawless,\ninquisition in her look.\n\n\u201cThat is exactly what I mean to do, with your permission, my dear. I\nhope to see him laying about among the grouse in due season.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Duke, you are painfully Bohemian. I can remember when you were\nperfectly precise and exclusive, and--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an awful prig I must have been!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt. That was before you went aroving in savage countries,\nand picked up all sorts of acquaintances, making friends with the most\nimpossible folk. I should never be surprised to see you drive Shon\nMcGann--and his wife, of course--and Pretty Pierre--with some other\nman\u2019s wife--up to the door in a dogcart; their clothes in a saddle-bag,\nor something less reputable, to stay a month. Duke, you have lost your\ndecorum; you are a gipsy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear Shon McGann and Pierre wouldn\u2019t enjoy being with us as I should\nenjoy having them. You can never understand what a life that is out in\nPierre\u2019s country. If it weren\u2019t for you and the bairn, I should be\noff there now. There is something of primeval man in me. I am never so\nhealthy and happy, when away from you, as in prowling round the outposts\nof civilisation, and living on beans and bear\u2019s meat.\u201d\n\nHe stretched to his feet, and his wife rose with him. There was a fine\ncolour on his cheek, and his eye had a pleasant fiery energy. His wife\ntapped him on the arm with her fan. She understood him very well, though\npretending otherwise. \u201cDuke, you are incorrigible. I am in daily dread\nof your starting off in the middle of the night, leaving me--\u201d\n\n\u201cWatering your couch with your tears?\u201d\n\n\u201c--and hearing nothing more from you till a cable from Quebec or\nWinnipeg tells me that you are on your way to the Arctic Circle with\nPierre or some other heathen. But, seriously, where did you meet Mr.\nVandewaters--Heavens, what a name!--and that other person? And what is\nthe other person\u2019s name?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other person carries the contradictory name of Stephen Pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does he continually finger his face, and show his emotions so? He\nassents to everything said to him by an appreciative exercise of his\nfeatures.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear, you ask a great and solemn question. Let me introduce the\nyoung man, that you may get your answer at the fountain-head.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a moment, Duke. Sit down and tell me when and where you met these\nmen, and why you have continued the acquaintance.\u201d\n\n\u201cMolly,\u201d he said, obeying her, \u201cyou are a terrible inquisitor, and the\nprivacy of one\u2019s chamber were the kinder place to call one to account.\nBut I bend to your implacability.... Mr. Vandewaters, like myself, has\na taste for roving, though our aims are not identical. He has a\nfine faculty for uniting business and pleasure. He is not a thorough\nsportsman--there is always a certain amount of enthusiasm, even in the\nunrewarded patience of the true hunter; but he sufficeth. Well, Mr.\nVandewaters had been hunting in the far north, and looking after a\npromising mine at the same time. He was on his way south at one angle,\nI at another angle, bound for the same point. Shon McGann was with me;\nPierre with Vandewaters. McGann left me, at a certain point, to join his\nwife at a Barracks of the Riders of the Plains. I had about a hundred\nmiles to travel alone. Well, I got along the first fifty all right.\nThen came trouble. In a bad place of the hills I fell and broke an ankle\nbone. I had an Eskimo dog of the right sort with me. I wrote a line on\na bit of birch bark, tied it round his neck, and started him away,\ntrusting my luck that he would pull up somewhere. He did. He ran into\nVandewaters\u2019s camp that evening. Vandewaters and Pierre started away at\nonce. They had dogs, and reached me soon.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I had seen Pierre for years. They fixed me up,\nand we started south. And that\u2019s as it was in the beginning with Mr.\nJohn Vandewaters and me.\u201d\n\nLady Lawless had been watching the two strangers during the talk, though\nonce or twice she turned and looked at her husband admiringly. When he\nhad finished she said: \u201cThat is very striking. What a pity it is that\nmen we want to like spoil all by their lack of form!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure about Vandewaters. Does he look flurried by these\nsurroundings?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. He certainly has an air of contentment. It is, I suppose, the usual\nair of self-made Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to London, E.C., and you will find the same, plus smugness. Now, Mr.\nVandewaters has real power--and taste too, as you will see. Would you\nthink Mr. Stephen Pride a self-made man?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot think of any one else who would be proud of the patent. Please\nto consider the seals about his waistcoat, and the lady-like droop of\nhis shoulders.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet he is thought to be a young man of parts. He has money, made by\nhis ancestors; he has been round the world; he belongs to societies for\nculture and--\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he will rave of the Poet\u2019s Corner, ask if one likes Pippa Passes,\nand expect to be introduced to every woman in the room at a tea-party,\nto say nothing of proposing impossible things, such as taking one\u2019s girl\nfriends to the opera alone, sending them boxes of confectionery, and\nwriting them dreadfully reverential notes at the same time. Duke, the\ncreature is impossible, believe me. Never, never, if you love me, invite\nhim to Craigruie. I met one of his tribe at Lady Macintyre\u2019s when I was\njust out of school; and at the dinner-table, when the wine went round,\nhe lifted his voice and asked for a cup of tea, saying he never \u2018drank.\u2019\nActually he did, Duke.\u201d\n\nHer husband laughed quietly. He had a man\u2019s enjoyment of a woman\u2019s\ndislike of bad form. \u201cA common criminal man, Molly. Tell me, which is\nthe greater crime: to rob a bank or use a fish-knife for asparagus?\u201d\n\nLady Lawless fanned herself. \u201cDuke, you make me hot. But if you will\nhave the truth: the fish-knife business by all means. Nobody need feel\nuncomfortable about the burglary, except the burglar; but see what a\nposition for the other person\u2019s hostess.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear, women have no civic virtues. Their credo is, \u2018I believe in\nbeauty and fine linen, and the thing that is not gauche.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis wife was smiling. \u201cWell, have it your own way. It is a creed of\ncomfort, at any rate. And now, Duke, if I must meet the man of mines and\nrailways and the spare person making faces at Lord Hampstead, let it be\nsoon, that it may be done with; and pray don\u2019t invite them to Craigruie\ntill I have a chance to speak with you again. I will not have impossible\npeople at a house-party.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a difficult fellow your husband is, Molly!\u201d\n\n\u201cDifficult; but perfectly possible. His one fault is a universal\nsympathy which shines alike on the elect--and the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo. Well, this is our dance. After it is over, prepare for the\nAmericanos.\u201d\n\nHalf-an-hour later Mr. Vandewaters was standing in a conspicuous corner\ntalking to Lady Lawless.\n\n\u201cIt is, then, your first visit to England?\u201d she asked. He had a dry,\ndeliberate voice, unlike the smooth, conventional voices round him.\n\u201cYes, Lady Lawless,\u201d he replied: \u201cit\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve put my foot\nin London town, and--perhaps you won\u2019t believe it of an American--I find\nit doesn\u2019t take up a very conspicuous place.\u201d\n\nThe humour was slightly accentuated, and Lady Lawless shrank a little,\nas if she feared the depths of divertisement to which this speech might\nlead; but a quick look at the man assured her of his common-sense, and\nshe answered: \u201cIt is of the joys of London that no one is so important\nbut finds the space he fills a small one, which may be filled acceptably\nby some one else at any moment. It is easy for kings and princes\neven--we have secluded princes here now--to get lost and forgotten in\nLondon.\u201d \u201cWell, that leaves little chance for ordinary Americans, who\ndon\u2019t bank on titles.\u201d\n\nShe looked up, puzzled in spite of herself. But she presently said, with\nfrankness and naivete: \u201cWhat does \u2018bank on titles\u2019 mean?\u201d\n\nHe stroked his beard, smiling quaintly, and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to\nput the thing better-it seems to fill the bill. But, anyway, Americans\nare republicans; and don\u2019t believe in titles, and--\u201d\n\n\u201cO, pardon me,\u201d she interrupted: \u201cof course, I see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got little ways of talking not the same as yours. You don\u2019t seem\nto have the snap to conversation that we have in the States. But I\u2019ll\nsay here that I think you have got a better style of talking. It isn\u2019t\nexhausting.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Pride said to me a moment ago that they spoke better English in\nBoston than any other place in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he, though, Lady Lawless? That\u2019s good. Well, I guess he was only\ntalking through his hat.\u201d\n\nShe was greatly amused. Her first impressions were correct. The man was\ninteresting. He had a quaint, practical mind. He had been thrown upon\nhis own resources, since infancy almost, in a new country; and he\nhad seen with his own eyes, nakedly, and without predisposition or\ninstruction. From childhood thoroughly adaptable, he could get into\ntouch with things quickly, and instantly like or dislike them. He had\nbeen used to approach great concerns with fearlessness and competency.\nHe respected a thing only for its real value, and its intrinsic value\nwas as clear to him as the market value. He had, perhaps, an exaggerated\nbelief in the greatness of his own country, because he liked eagerness\nand energy and daring. The friction and hurry of American life added to\nhis enjoyment. They acted on him like a stimulating air, in which he\nwas always bold, collected, and steady. He felt an exhilaration in being\nsuperior to the rustle of forces round him. It had been his habit to\nplay the great game of business with decision and adroitness. He had\nnot spared his opponent in the fight; he had crushed where his interests\nwere in peril and the sport played into his hands; comforting himself,\nif he thought of the thing, with the knowledge that he himself would\nhave been crushed if the other man had not. He had never been wilfully\nunfair, nor had he used dishonourable means to secure his ends: his name\nstood high in his own country for commercial integrity; men said: he\n\u201cplayed square.\u201d He had, maybe, too keen a contempt for dulness and\nincompetency in enterprise, and he loathed red-tape; but this\nwas racial. His mind was as open as his manners. He was utterly\napproachable. He was a millionaire, and yet in his own offices in New\nYork he was as accessible as a President. He handled things without\ngloves, and this was not a good thing for any that came to him with a\nweak case. He had a penetrating intelligence; and few men attempted,\nafter their first sophistical statements, to impose upon him: he sent\nthem away unhappy. He did not like England altogether: first, because it\nlacked, as he said, enterprise; and because the formality, decorum and\nexcessive convention fretted him. He saw that in many things the old\nland was backward, and he thought that precious time was being wasted.\nStill, he could see that there were things, purely social, in which\nthe Londoners were at advantage; and he acknowledged this when he said,\nconcerning Stephen Pride\u2019s fond boast, that he was \u201ctalking through his\nhat.\u201d\n\nLady Lawless smiled, and after a moment rejoined:\n\n\u201cDoes it mean that he was mumming, as it were, like a conjurer?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly. You are pretty smart, Lady Lawless; for I can see that, from\nyour stand-point, it isn\u2019t always easy to catch the meaning of sayings\nlike that. But they do hit the case, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey give a good deal of individuality to conversation,\u201d was the vague\nreply. \u201cWhat, do you think, is the chief lack in England?\u201d\n\n\u201cNerve and enterprise. But I\u2019m not going to say you ought to have the\nsame kind of nerve as ours. We are a different tribe, with different\nsurroundings, and we don\u2019t sit in the same kind of saddle. We ride for\nall we\u2019re worth all the time. You sit back and take it easy. We are\nnever satisfied unless we are behind a fast trotter; you are\ncontent with a good cob that steps high, tosses its head, and has an\naristocratic stride.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you been in the country much?\u201d she asked, without any seeming\nrelevancy.\n\nHe was keen enough. He saw the veiled point of her question. \u201cNo: I\u2019ve\nnever been in the country here,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose you mean that I\ndon\u2019t see or know England till I\u2019ve lived there.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so, Mr. Vandewaters.\u201d She smiled to think what an undistinguished\nname it was. It suggested pumpkins in the front garden. Yet here its\nowner was perfectly at his ease, watching the scene before him\nwith good-natured superiority. \u201cLondon is English; but it is very\ncosmopolitan, you know,\u201d she added; \u201cand I fancy you can see it is not a\nplace for fast trotters. The Park would be too crowded for that--even if\none wished to drive a Maud S.\u201d\n\nHe turned his slow keen eyes on her, and a smile broadened into a low\nlaugh, out of which he said:\n\n\u201cWhat do you know of Maud S? I didn\u2019t think you would be up in racing\nmatters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou forget that my husband is a traveller, and an admirer of Americans\nand things American.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d he answered; \u201cand a staving good traveller he is. You don\u2019t\ncatch him asleep, I can tell you, Lady Lawless. He has stuff in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stuff to make a good American?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; with something over. He\u2019s the kind of Englishman that can keep\ncool when things are ticklish, and look as if he was in a parlour all\nthe time. Americans keep cool, but look cheeky. O, I know that. We\nsquare our shoulders and turn out our toes, and push our hands into\nour pockets, and act as if we owned the world. Hello--by Jingo!\u201d Then,\napologetically: \u201cI beg your pardon, Lady Lawless; it slipped.\u201d\n\nLady Lawless followed Mr. Vandewaters\u2019s glance, and saw, passing on\nher husband\u2019s arm, a tall, fascinating girl. She smiled meaningly to\nherself, as she sent a quick quizzical look at the American, and said,\npurposely misinterpreting his exclamation: \u201cI am not envious, Mr.\nVandewaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not. That\u2019s a commoner thing with us than with you. American\ngirls get more notice and attention from their cradles up, and they\nwant it all along the line. You see, we\u2019ve mostly got the idea that an\nEnglishman expects from his wife what an American woman expects from her\nhusband.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do Americans get these impressions about us?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom our newspapers, I guess; and the newspapers take as the\nground-work of their belief the Bow Street cases where Englishmen are\ncornered for beating their wives.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose we were to judge of American Society by the cases in a Chicago\nDivorce Court?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere you have me on toast. That\u2019s what comes of having a husband who\ntakes American papers. Mind you, I haven\u2019t any idea that the American\npapers are right. I\u2019ve had a lot to do with newspapers, and they are\npretty ignorant, I can tell you--cheap all round. What\u2019s a newspaper,\nanyway, but an editor, more or less smart and overworked, with an owner\nbehind him who has got some game on hand? I know: I\u2019ve been there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow have you \u2018been there\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve owned four big papers all at once, and had fifty others under my\nthumb.\u201d\n\nLady Lawless caught her breath; but she believed him. \u201cYou must be very\nrich.\u201d\n\n\u201cOwning newspapers doesn\u2019t mean riches. It\u2019s a lever, though, for\ntipping the dollars your way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose they have--tipped your way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes: pretty well. But, don\u2019t follow this lead any farther, Lady\nLawless, or you may come across something that will give you a start. I\nshould like to keep on speaking terms with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean that a man cannot hold fifty newspapers under his thumb, and\nlive in the glare of a search-light also?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly. You can\u2019t make millions without pulling wires.\u201d\n\nShe saw him watching the girl on her husband\u2019s arm. She had the\ninstinct of her sex. She glanced at the stately girl again; then at\nMr. Vandewaters critically, and rejoined, quizzically: \u201cDid you--make\nmillions?\u201d\n\nHis eyes still watching, he replied abstractedly. \u201cYes: a few handfuls,\nand lost a few--\u2018that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cTo get them back on the London market?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I am here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have not come in vain?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could tell you better in a month or so from now. In any case, I don\u2019t\nstand to lose. I\u2019ve come to take things away from England.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope you will take away a good opinion of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019d been any doubt of it half an hour ago, it would be all gone\nthis minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is nice of you; and not in your usual vein, I should think. But,\nMr. Vandewaters, we want you to come to Craigruie, our country place, to\nspend a week. Then you will have a chance to judge us better, or rather\nmore broadly and effectively.\u201d She was looking at the girl, and at that\nmoment she caught Sir Duke\u2019s eye. She telegraphed to him to come.\n\n\u201cThank you, Lady Lawless, I\u2019m glad you have asked me. But--\u201d He glanced\nto where Mr. Pride was being introduced to the young lady on Sir Duke\u2019s\narm, and paused.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping,\u201d she added, interpreting his thought, and speaking a\nlittle dryly, \u201cthat your friend, Mr. Stephen Pride\u201d--the name sounded so\nludicrous--\u201cwill join us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be proud enough, you may be sure. It\u2019s a singular combination,\nPride and myself, isn\u2019t it? But, you see, he has a fortune which, as\nyet, he has never been able to handle for himself; and I do it for him.\nWe are partners, and, though you mightn\u2019t think it, he has got more\nmoney now than when he put his dollars at my disposal to help me make a\nfew millions at a critical time.\u201d\n\nLady Lawless let her fan touch Mr. Vandewaters\u2019s arm. \u201cI am going to\ndo you a great favour. You see that young lady coming to us with\nmy husband? Well, I am going to introduce you to her. It is such as\nshe--such women--who will convince you--\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u201c--that you have yet to make your--what shall I call it?--Ah, I have it:\nyour \u2018biggest deal,\u2019--and, in truth, your best.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d rejoined Vandewaters musingly. \u201cIs that so? I always\nthought I\u2019d make my biggest deal in the States. Who is she? She is\nhandsome.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is more than handsome, and she is the Honourable Gracia Raglan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand about \u2018The Honourable.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI will explain that another time.\u201d\n\nA moment later Miss Raglan, in a gentle bewilderment, walked down the\nballroom on the arm of the millionaire, half afraid that something\ngauche would happen; but by the time she had got to the other end was\nreassured, and became interested.\n\nSir Duke said to his wife in an aside, before he left her with Mr.\nVandewaters\u2019s financial partner: \u201cWhat is your pretty conspiracy,\nMolly?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo talk English, Duke, and do not interfere.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, on the way home, Sir Duke said: \u201cYou asked Mr. Pride\ntoo?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; I grieve to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy grieve?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause his experiences with us seem to make him dizzy. He will be\nterribly in earnest with every woman in the house, if--\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do not keep him in line yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so. And the creature is not even interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cCast your eye about. He has millions; you have cousins.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not mean that, Duke? I would see them in their graves first. He\nsays \u2018My lady\u2019 every other sentence, and wants to send me flowers, and a\nbox for the opera, and to drive me in the Park.\u201d\n\nHer husband laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll stake my life he can\u2019t ride. You will have\nhim about the place like a tame cat.\u201d Then, seeing that his wife was\nannoyed: \u201cNever mind, Molly, I will help you all I can. I want to be\nkind to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you do. But what is your \u2018pretty conspiracy,\u2019 Duke?\u201d\n\n\u201cA well-stocked ranche in Colorado.\u201d He did not mean it. And she knew\nit.\n\n\u201cHow can you be so mercenary?\u201d she replied.\n\nThen they both laughed, and said that they were like the rest of the\nworld.\n\n\n\nII\n\nLady Lawless was an admirable hostess, and she never appeared to better\nadvantage in the character than during the time when Miss Gracia Raglan,\nMr. John Vandewaters, and Mr. Stephen Pride were guests at Craigruie.\nThe men accepted Mr. Vandewaters at once as a good fellow and a very\nsensible man. He was a heavy-weight for riding; but it was not the\nhunting season, and, when they did ride, a big horse carried him very\nwell. At grouse-shooting he showed to advantage. Mr. Pride never rode.\nHe went shooting only once, and then, as Mr. Vandewaters told him, he\ngot \u201crattled.\u201d He was then advised by his friend to remain at home\nand cultivate his finer faculties. At the same time, Mr. Vandewaters\nparenthetically remarked to Sir Duke Lawless that Mr. Pride knew the\npoets backwards, and was smart at French. He insisted on bringing out\nthe good qualities of his comrade; but he gave him much strong advice\nprivately. He would have done it just the same at the risk of losing\na fortune, were it his whim--he would have won the fortune back in due\ncourse.\n\nAt the present time Mr. Vandewaters was in the heat of some large\ncommercial movements. No one would have supposed it, save for the fact\nthat telegrams and cablegrams were brought to him day and night. He had\nliberally salaried the telegraph-clerk to work after hours, simply to\nbe at his service. The contents of these messages never shook his\nequanimity. He was quiet, urbane, dry-mannered, at all times. Mr. Pride,\nhowever, was naturally excitable. He said of himself earnestly that he\nhad a sensitive nature. He said it to Mrs. Gregory Thorne, whose reply\nwas: \u201cDear me, and when things are irritating and painful to you do you\nnever think of suicide?\u201d Then she turned away to speak to some one, as\nif she had been interrupted, and intended to take up the subject again;\nbut she never did. This remark caused Mr. Pride some nervous moments.\nHe was not quite sure how she meant it. But it did not depress him as it\nmight otherwise have done, for his thoughts were running much in another\nchannel with a foolish sort of elation.\n\nAs Lady Lawless had predicted, he was assiduously attentive to her, and\nit needed all her tact and cheerful frankness to keep him in line. She\nmanaged it very well: Mr. Pride\u2019s devotion was not too noticeable to\nthe other guests. She tried to turn his attentions to some pretty girls;\nbut, although there were one or two who might, in some weak moments,\nhave compromised with his millions, he did no more than saunter with\nthem on the terrace and oppress them with his lisping egotism. Every one\nhinted that he seemed an estimable, but trying, young man; and, as Sir\nDuke said to his wife, the men would not have him at any price.\n\nAs for Mr. Vandewaters and Gracia Raglan, Lady Lawless was not very sure\nthat her delicate sympathy was certain of reward. The two were naturally\nthrown together a good deal; but Miss Raglan was a girl of singular\nindividuality and high-mindedness, and she was keen enough to see from\nthe start what Lady Lawless suspected might happen. She did not resent\nthis,--she was a woman; but it roused in her a spirit of criticism, and\nshe threw up a barrier of fine reserve, which puzzled Mr. Vandewaters.\nHe did not see that Lady Lawless was making a possible courtship easy\nfor him. If he had, it would have made no difference: he would have\nlooked at it as at most things, broadly. He was not blind to the fact\nthat his money might be a \u201cfactor\u201d, but, as he said to himself, his\nmillions were a part of him--they represented, like whist-counters, so\nmuch pluck and mother-wit. He liked the general appreciation of them: he\nknew very well that people saw him in them and them in him. Miss Raglan\nattracted him from the moment of meeting. She was the first woman of her\nclass that he had ever met closely; and the possibility of having as his\nown so adorable a comrade was inspiring. He sat down sometimes as the\ndays went on--it was generally when he was shaving--and thought upon his\nintention regarding Miss Raglan, in relation to his humble past; for\nhe had fully made up his mind to marry her, if she would have him.\nHe wondered what she would think when he told her of his life; and he\nlaughed at the humour of the situation. He had been into Debrett, and he\nknew that she could trace her family back to the Crusades.\n\nHe determined to make a clean breast of it. One day he was obliged to\nremain at the house in expectation of receiving important telegrams, and\nthe only people who appeared at lunch were Lady Lawless, Mrs. Gregory\nThorne (who was expecting her husband), Miss Raglan; Pride, and himself.\nWhile at luncheon he made up his mind to have a talk with Miss Raglan.\nIn the library after luncheon the opportunity was given. It was a warm,\npleasant day, and delightful in the grounds.\n\nAfter one or two vain efforts to escape, Mrs. Gregory Thorne and Lady\nLawless resigned themselves to the attentions of Mr. Pride; and for\nonce Lady Lawless did not check Mrs. Thorne\u2019s irony. It was almost a\nsatisfaction to see Mr. Pride\u2019s bewildered looks, and his inability\nto know whether or not he should resent (whether it would be proper to\nresent) this softly-showered satire.\n\nMr. Vandewaters and Gracia Raglan talked more freely than they had ever\ndone before.\n\n\u201cDo you really like England?\u201d she said to him; then, waving her hand\nlightly to the beeches and the clean-cropped grass through the window,\n\u201cI mean do you like our \u2018trim parterres,\u2019 our devotion to mere living,\npleasure, sport, squiring, and that sort of thing?\u201d\n\nHe raised his head, glanced out, drew in a deep breath, thrust his hands\ndown in the pockets of his coat, and looking at her with respectful good\nhumour, said: \u201cLike it? Yes, right down to the ground. Why shouldn\u2019t\nI! It\u2019s the kind of place I should like to come to in my old days. You\nneedn\u2019t die in a hurry here. See?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you would not be like the old sailors who must live where\nthey can scent the brine? You have been used to an active, adventurous,\nhurried life. Do you think you could endure this humdrum of enjoyment?\u201d\n\nIt would be hard to tell quite what was running in Gracia Raglan\u2019s mind,\nand, for the moment, she herself hardly knew; but she had a sudden,\novermastering wish to make the man talk: to explore and, maybe, find\nsurprising--even trying--things. She was astonished that she enjoyed his\nsociety so keenly. Even now, as she spoke, she remembered a day and a\nnight since his coming, when he was absent in London; also how the party\nseemed to have lost its character and life, and how, when Mr. Pride\ncondescended, for a few moments, to decline from Lady Lawless upon\nherself, she was even pleasant to him, making him talk about Mr.\nVandewaters, and relishing the enthusiastic loyalty of the supine young\nman. She, like Lady Lawless, had learned to see behind the firm bold\nexterior, not merely a notable energy, force, self-reliance, and\nmasterfulness, but a native courtesy, simplicity, and refinement\nwhich surprised her. Of all the men she knew not a half-dozen had an\nappreciation of nature or of art. They affected art, and some of them\nwent to the Academy or the private views in Bond Street; but they had\nlittle feeling for the business. They did it in a well-bred way, with\ntaste, but not with warmth.\n\nMr. Vandewaters now startled her by quoting suddenly lines from an\nEnglish poet unknown to her. By chance she was turning over the Academy\npictures of the year, and came at last to one called \u201cA Japanese Beauty\nof Old Days\u201d--an exquisite thing.\n\n\u201cIs it not fascinating?\u201d she said. \u201cSo piquant and fresh.\u201d\n\nHe gave a silent laugh, as was his custom when he enjoyed anything, and\nthen replied:\n\n\u201cI came across a little book of verses one day in the States. A friend\nof mine, the president of a big railway, gave it to me. He does some\npainting himself when he travels in his Pullman in the Rockies. Well, it\nhad some verses on just such a picture as that. Hits it off right, Miss\nRaglan.\u201d\n\n\u201cVerses?\u201d she remarked, lifting her eyebrows. She expected something out\nof the \u201cpoet\u2019s corner\u201d of a country newspaper. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, one\u2019s enough to show the style. This is it:\n\n       \u201c\u2018Was I a Samurai renowned,\n        Two-sworded, fierce, immense of bow?\n        A histrion angular and profound?\n        A priest? or porter? Child, although\n        I have forgotten clean, I know\n        That in the shade of Fujisan,\n        What time the cherry-orchards blow,\n        I loved you once in old Japan.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe verse on the lips of Mr. Vandewaters struck her strangely. He was\nnot like any man she had known. Most self-made Englishmen, with such a\nburly exterior and energy, and engaged in such pursuits, could not, to\nsave themselves from hanging, have impressed her as Mr. Vandewaters did.\nThere was a big round sympathy in the tone, a timbre in the voice, which\nmade the words entirely fitting. Besides, he said them without any kind\nof affectation, and with a certain turn of dry humour, as if he were\ninwardly laughing at the idea of the poem.\n\n\u201cThe verses are charming,\u201d she said, musingly; \u201cand the idea put that\nway is charming also. But do you think there would be much amusement\nin living half-a-dozen times, or even twice, unless you were quite sure\nthat you remembered everything? This gentleman was peculiarly fortunate\nto recall Fujisan, and the orange orchards--and the girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe you are right. One life is about enough for most of us.\nMemory is all very fine; but you\u2019d want a life set apart for remembering\nthe others after awhile.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you not add, \u2018And that would bore one?\u2019 Most of the men I know\nwould say so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I never used the word that way in my life. When I don\u2019t like a\nthing, that ends it--it has got to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot do that with everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty much, if I set my mind to it. It is astonishing how things\u2019ll\ncome round your way if you keep on thinking and willing them so.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you always got everything you wanted?\u201d He had been looking off\ninto the grounds through the open window. Now he turned slowly upon her.\n\n\u201cSo far I have got everything I set my mind to get. Little things don\u2019t\ncount. You lose them sometimes because you want to work at something\nelse; sometimes because, as in cards, you are throwing a few away to\nsave the whole game.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her, as she thought, curiously. In his mind he was\nwondering if she knew that he had made up his mind to marry her. She was\nsuddenly made aware of the masterfulness of his spirit, which might, she\nknew, be applied to herself.\n\n\u201cLet us go into the grounds,\u201d he added, all at once. Soon after, in\nthe shade of the trees, she broke in upon the thread of their casual\nconversation. \u201cA few moments ago,\u201d she murmured, \u201cyou said: \u2018One life is\nabout enough for most of us.\u2019 Then you added a disparaging remark about\nmemory. Well, that doesn\u2019t seem like your usual point of view--more like\nthat of Mr. Pride; but not so plaintive, of course. Pray do smoke,\u201d\n she added, as, throwing back his coat, he exposed some cigars in his\nwaistcoat pocket. \u201cI am sure you always smoke after lunch.\u201d\n\nHe took out a cigar, cut off the end, and put it in his mouth. But he\ndid not light it. Then he glanced up at her with a grave quizzical look\nas though wondering what would be the effect of his next words, and a\nsmile played at his lips.\n\n\u201cWhat I meant was this. I think we get enough out of our life to last\nus for centuries. It\u2019s all worth doing from the start, no matter what\nit is: working, fighting, marching and countermarching, plotting and\ncounterplotting, backing your friends and hating your foes, playing\nbig games and giving others a chance to, standing with your hand on the\nlynch-pin, or pulling your head safe out of the hot-pot. But I don\u2019t\nthink it is worth doing twice. The interest wouldn\u2019t be fresh. For men\nand women and life, with a little different dress, are the same as they\nalways were; and there\u2019s only the same number of passions working now,\nas at the beginning. I want to live life up to the hilt; because it is\nall new as I go on; but never twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d She looked at him earnestly for a moment, and then added: \u201cI\nshould think you would have seen lost chances; and doing things a second\ntime might do them better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never missed chances,\u201d he replied, simply: \u201cnever except twice, and\nthen--\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it was to give the other fellow a chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d There was a kind of dubiousness in her tone. He noticed it. \u201cYou\ncan hardly understand, Miss Raglan. Fact is, it was one of those deals\nwhen you can make a million, in a straight enough game; but it comes out\nof another man--one, maybe, that you don\u2019t know; who is playing just the\nsame as you are. I have had a lot of sport; but I\u2019ve never crippled any\none man, when my engine has been dead on him. I have played more against\norganisations than single men.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was the most remarkable chance you ever had to make a million, and\ndid not?\u201d\n\nHe threw back his head, smiling shrewdly. \u201cWhen by accident my enemy got\nhold of a telegram meant for me. I was standing behind a frosted glass\ndoor, and through the narrow bevel of clear glass I watched him read\nit. I never saw a struggle like that. At last he got up, snatched\nan envelope, put the telegram inside, wrote my name, and called a\nmessenger. I knew what was in the message. I let the messenger go, and\nwatched that man for ten minutes. It was a splendid sight. The telegram\nhad given him a big chance to make a million or two, as he thought. But\nhe backed himself against the temptation, and won. That day I could have\nput the ball into his wicket; but I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a funny case of the\nkind.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he ever know?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t. We are fighting yet. He is richer than I am now, and at this\nmoment he\u2019s playing a hard game straight at several interests of mine.\nBut I reckon I can stop him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must get a great deal out of life,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you always\nenjoyed it so?\u201d She was thinking it would be strange to live in contact\nwith such events very closely. It was so like adventure.\n\n\u201cAlways--from the start.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me something of it all, won\u2019t you?\u201d He did not hesitate.\n\n\u201cI was born in a little place in Maine. My mother was a good woman, they\nsaid--straight as a die all her life. I can only remember her in a\nkind of dream, when she used to gather us children about the big\nrocking-chair, and pray for us, and for my father, who was away most\nof the time, working in the timber-shanties in the winter, and at\nodd things in the summer. My father wasn\u2019t much of a man. He was\nkind-hearted, but shiftless, but pretty handsome for a man from Maine.\n\n\u201cMy mother died when I was six years old. Things got bad. I was the\nyoungest. The oldest was only ten years old. She was the head of the\nhouse. She had the pluck of a woman. We got along somehow, until one\nday, when she and I were scrubbing the floor, she caught cold. She died\nin three days.\u201d\n\nHere he paused; and, without glancing at Miss Raglan, who sat very\nstill, but looking at him, he lighted his cigar.\n\n\u201cThen things got worse. My father took to drinking hard, and we had\nmighty little to eat. I chored around, doing odd things in the village.\nI have often wondered that people didn\u2019t see the stuff that was in me,\nand give me a chance. They didn\u2019t, though. As for my relatives: one was\na harness-maker. He sent me out in the dead of winter to post bills for\nmiles about, and gave me ten cents for it. Didn\u2019t even give me a meal.\nTwenty years after he came to me and wanted to borrow a hundred dollars.\nI gave him five hundred on condition that he\u2019d not come near me for the\nrest of his natural life.\n\n\u201cThe next thing I did was to leave home--\u2018run away,\u2019 I suppose, is the\nway to put it. I got to Boston, and went for a cabin-boy on a steamer;\ntravelled down to Panama, and from there to Brazil. At Brazil I got on\nanother ship, and came round to San Francisco. I got into trouble in San\nFrancisco with the chief mate of the Flying Polly, because I tried to\nteach him his business. One of the first things I learned in life was\nnot to interfere with people who had a trade and didn\u2019t understand\nit. In San Francisco I got out of the situation. I took to selling\nnewspapers in the streets.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough money in it. I went for a cabin-boy again, and\ntravelled to Australia. There, once more, I resigned my position,\nchiefly because I wouldn\u2019t cheerfully let the Mate bang me about the\nquarter-deck. I expect I was a precocious youth, and wasn\u2019t exactly\nthe kind for Sunday-school prizes. In Melbourne I began to speculate.\nI found a ticket for the theatre where an American actor--our biggest\nactor today--was playing, and I tried to sell it outside the door of the\ntheatre where they were crowding to see him. The man who bought it was\nthe actor himself. He gave me two dollars more than the regular price.\nI expect he knew from my voice I was an American. Is there anything\npeculiar about my voice, Miss Raglan?\u201d\n\nShe looked at him quickly, smiled, and said in a low tone: \u201cYes,\nsomething peculiar. Please go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, anyway, he said to me: \u2018Look here, where did you come from,\nmy boy?\u2019 I told him the State of Maine. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 he\nasked. \u2018Speculating, said I, and seeing things.\u2019 He looked me up and\ndown. \u2018How are you getting on?\u2019 \u2018Well. I\u2019ve made four dollars to-day,\u2019\nI answered. \u2018Out of this ticket?\u2019 I expect I grinned. He suddenly caught\nme by the arm and whisked me inside the theatre--the first time I\u2019d ever\nbeen in a theatre in my life. I shall never forget it. He took me around\nto his dressing-room, stuck me in a corner, and prodded me with his\nforefinger. \u2018Look here,\u2019 he said, \u2018I guess I\u2019ll hire you to speculate\nfor me.\u2019 And that\u2019s how I came to get twenty-five dollars a month and\nmy living from a great American actor. When I got back to America--with\nhim--I had two hundred and fifty dollars in cash, and good clothes.\nI started a peanut-stand, and sold papers and books, and became a\nspeculator. I heard two men talking one day at my stall about a railway\nthat was going to run through a certain village, and how they intended\nto buy up the whole place. I had four hundred and fifty dollars then.\nI went down to that village, and bought some lots myself. I made four\nthousand dollars. Then I sold more books, and went on speculating.\u201d\n\nHe paused, blew his cigar-smoke slowly from him a moment; then turned\nwith a quick look to Miss Raglan, and smiled as at some incongruous\nthing. He was wondering what would be the effect of his next words.\n\n\u201cWhen I was about twenty-two, and had ten thousand dollars, I fell\nin love. She was a bright-faced, smart girl. Her mother kept a\nboarding-house in New York; not an up-town boarding-house. She waited on\ntable. I suppose a man can be clever in making money, and knowing how\nto handle men, and not know much about women. I thought she was worth\na good deal more to me than the ten thousand dollars. She didn\u2019t know\nI had that money. A drummer--that\u2019s a commercial traveller--came along,\nwho had a salary of, maybe, a thousand dollars a year. She jilted me.\nShe made a mistake. That year I made twenty-five thousand dollars. I saw\nher a couple of years ago. She was keeping a boarding-house too, and her\ndaughter was waiting on table. I\u2019m sorry for that girl: it isn\u2019t any fun\nbeing poor. I didn\u2019t take much interest in women after that. I put my\nsurplus affections into stocks and shares, and bulling and bearing...\nWell, that is the way the thing has gone till now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat became of your father and your brother?\u201d she asked in a neutral\ntone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about my father. He disappeared after I left, and\nnever turned up again. And Jim--poor Jim!--he was shiftless. Jim was a\ntanner. It was no good setting him up in business. Steady income was the\ncheapest way. But Jim died of too much time on his hands. His son is\nin Mexico somewhere. I sent him there, and I hope he\u2019ll stay. If he\ndoesn\u2019t, his salary stops: he is shiftless too. That is not the kind of\nthing, and they are not the kind of people you know best, Miss Raglan.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her, eyes full-front, bravely, honestly, ready to face the\nworst. Her head was turned away.\n\nHe nodded to himself. It was as he feared.\n\nAt that moment a boy came running along the walk towards them, and\nhanded Mr. Vandewaters a telegram. He gave the lad a few pence, then,\nwith an apology, opened the telegram. Presently he whistled softly, in\na quick surprised way. Then he stuffed the paper into his waistcoat\npocket, threw away his cigar, and turned to Gracia Raglan, whose face as\nyet was only half towards him. \u201cI hope your news is good,\u201d she said very\nquietly.\n\n\u201cPretty bad, in a way,\u201d he answered. \u201cI have lost a couple of\nmillions--maybe a little more.\u201d\n\nShe gasped, and turned an astonished face on him. He saw her startled\nlook, and laughed.\n\n\u201cDoes it not worry you?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI have got more important things on hand just now,\u201d he answered. \u201cVery\nmuch more important,\u201d he added, and there was that in his voice which\nmade her turn away her head again.\n\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat the story you have just heard is not\nthe kind of an autobiography you would care to have told in your\ndrawing-room?\u201d\n\nStill she did not reply; but her hands were clasped tightly in front of\nher. \u201cNo: I suppose not,\u201d he went on--\u201cI--I suppose not. And yet, do you\nknow, Miss Raglan, I don\u2019t feel a bit ashamed of it, after all: which\nmay be evidence of my lost condition.\u201d\n\nNow she turned to him with a wonderful light in her eyes, her sweet,\nstrong face rich with feeling. She put out her hand to his arm, and\ntouched it quickly, nervously.\n\n\u201cYour story has touched me inexpressibly,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not know\nthat men could be so strong and frank and courageous as you. I did not\nknow that men could be so great; that any man could think more of what\na woman thought of--of his life\u2019s story--than of\u201d--she paused, and then\ngave a trembling little laugh--\u201cof two millions or more.\u201d\n\nHe got to his feet, and faced her. \u201cYou--you are a woman, by heaven!\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cYou are finer even than I thought you. I am not worthy to ask you\nwhat I had in my mind to ask you; but there is no man in God\u2019s universe\nwho would prize you as I do. I may be a poor man before sundown. If\nthat happens, though, I shall remember the place where I had the biggest\nmoment of my life, and the woman who made that moment possible.\u201d\n\nNow she also rose. There was a brave high look in her face; but her\nvoice shook a little as she said: \u201cYou have never been a coward, why be\na coward now?\u201d\n\nSmiling, he slowly answered: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t if I were sure about my\ndollars.\u201d\n\nShe did not reply, but glanced down, not with coquetry, but because she\ncould not stand the furnace of his eyes.\n\n\u201cYou said a moment ago,\u201d she ventured, \u201cthat you have had one big moment\nin your life. Oughtn\u2019t it to bring you good fortune?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will--it will,\u201d he said, reaching his hand towards hers.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d she rejoined archly. \u201cI am going. Please do not follow me.\u201d\n Then, over her shoulder, as she left him: \u201cIf you have luck, I shall\nwant a subscription for my hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs many thousands as you like,\u201d he answered: then, as she sped away: \u201cI\nwill have her, and the millions too!\u201d adding reminiscently: \u201cYes, Lady\nLawless, this is my biggest deal.\u201d\n\nHe tramped to the stables, asked for and got a horse, and rode away to\nthe railway station. It was dinner time when he got back. He came down\nto dinner late, apologising to Lady Lawless as he did so. Glancing\nacross the table at Mr. Pride, he saw a peculiar excited look in the\nyoung man\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThe baby fool!\u201d he said to himself. \u201cHe\u2019s getting into mischief. I\u2019ll\nstartle him. If he knows that an army of his dollars is playing at\nfox-and-geese, he\u2019ll not make eyes at Lady Lawless this way--little\nass.\u201d\n\nLady Lawless appeared oblivious of the young man\u2019s devotional exercises.\nShe was engaged on a more congenial theme. In spite of Miss Raglan\u2019s\nexcellent acting, she saw that something had occurred. Mr. Vandewaters\nwas much the same as usual, save that his voice had an added ring. She\nwas not sure that all was right; but she was determined to know. Sir\nDuke was amused generally. He led a pretty by-play with Mrs. Gregory\nThorne, of whom he asked the details of the day, much to the\nconfusion, not admirably hid, of Mr. Pride; lamenting now and then Mr.\nVandewaters\u2019s absence from the shooting.\n\nMr. Vandewaters was cool enough. He said that he had been playing at\nnine-pins with railways, which was good enough sport for him. Soon after\ndinner, he was handed two telegrams. He glanced slowly up at Pride, as\nif debating whether to tell him something. He evidently decided against\nit, and, excusing himself by saying he was off to take a little walk in\nWall Street, went away to the telegraph office, where he stayed three\nhours.\n\nThe magnitude of the concerns, the admirable stoicism with which\nhe received alarming news, his dry humour while they waited between\nmessages--all were so unlike anything the telegraph-clerk had ever seen,\nor imagined, that the thing was like a preposterous dream. Even when,\nat last, a telegram came which the clerk vaguely felt was, somehow, like\nthe fall of an empire, Mr. Vandewaters remained unmoved. Then he sent\none more telegram, gave the clerk a pound, asked that the reply be sent\nto him as soon as it came, and went away, calmly smoking his cigar.\n\nIt was a mild night. When he got to the house he found some of the\nguests walking on the veranda. He joined them; but Miss Raglan was not\nwith them; nor were Lady Lawless and Mr. Pride. He wanted to see\nall three, and so he went into the house. There was no one in the\ndrawing-room. He reached the library in time to hear Lady Lawless say\nto Mr. Pride, who was disappearing through another door: \u201cYou had better\nask advice of Mr. Vandewaters.\u201d\n\nThe door closed. Mr. Vandewaters stepped forward.\n\nHe understood the situation. \u201cI guess I know how to advise him, Lady\nLawless,\u201d he said.\n\nShe turned on him quietly, traces of hauteur in her manner. Her\nself-pride had been hurt. \u201cYou have heard?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cOnly your last words, Lady Lawless. They were enough. I feel guilty in\nhaving brought him here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need not. I was glad to have your friend. He is young and effusive.\nLet us say no more about it.\n\n\u201cHe is tragically repentant; which is a pity. There is no reason why he\nshould not stay, and be sensible. Why should young men lose their heads,\nand be so absurdly earnest?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother poser, Lady Lawless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn all your life you never misunderstood things so, I am sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there is no virtue in keeping your head steady. I have spent most\nof my life wooing Madame Fortune; I find that makes a man canny.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has been very kind to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps it would surprise you if I told you that at this moment I am\nnot worth ten thousand dollars.\u201d She looked greatly astonished. \u201cI do\nnot understand,\u201d she said. She was thinking of what this might mean to\nGracia Raglan.\n\n\u201cYou see I\u2019ve been playing games at a disadvantage with some ruffians\nat New York. They have combined and got me into a corner. I have made my\nlast move. If it comes out right I shall be richer than ever; if not I\nmust begin all over again.\u201d\n\nLady Lawless looked at him curiously. She had never met a man like him\nbefore. His power seemed almost Napoleonic; his imperturbability was\nabsolute. Yet she noticed something new in him. On one side a kind of\ngrim forcefulness; on the other, a quiet sort of human sympathy. The\none, no doubt, had to do with the momentous circumstances amid which he\nwas placed; the other, with an event which she had, perhaps prematurely,\nanticipated.\n\n\u201cI wonder--I wonder at you,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you keep so cool while\nsuch tremendous things are happening?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I believe in myself, Lady Lawless. I have had to take my\nmeasure a good many times in this world. I never was defeated through my\nown stupidity. It has been the sheer luck of the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not look like a gamester,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s all pretty much a game in life, if you look at it right.\nIt is only a case of playing fair or foul.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never heard any Englishmen talk as you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery likely not,\u201d he responded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be unpleasant; but\nmost Englishmen work things out by the rule their fathers taught them,\nand not by native ingenuity. It is native wit that tells in the end, I\u2019m\nthinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you are right,\u201d she rejoined. \u201cThere must be a kind of genius\nin it.\u201d Here her voice dropped a little lower. \u201cI do not believe there\nare many Englishmen, even if they had your dollars--\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dollars I had this morning,\u201d he interposed.\n\n\u201c--who could have so strongly impressed Gracia Raglan.\u201d\n\nHe looked thoughtfully on the ground; then raised his eyes to Lady\nLawless, and said in a low, ringing tone:\n\n\u201cYes, I am going to do more than \u2018impress\u2019: I am going to convince her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cTo-morrow morning, I hope,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI believe I shall have my\nmillions again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cdo you not think that you ought to run no\nmore risks--for her sake?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is just what I mean to do, Lady Lawless. I\u2019ll settle millions\nwhere they ought to be settled, drop Wall Street, and--go into\ntraining.\u201d\n\n\u201cInto training?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYes, for a house on the Hudson, a villa at Cannes, a residence in\nGrosvenor Square, and a place in Devonshire--or somewhere else. Then,\u201d\n he added, with a twinkle in his eye, \u201cI shall need a good deal of time\nto cultivate accent.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d she said. \u201cYou are much more charming as you are.\u201d\n\nThey passed into the drawing-room.\n\n\u201cAre these things to be told?\u201d she asked, with a little suggestion in\nher voice.\n\n\u201cI can trust your discretion.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven in such circumstances?\u201d she asked. She paused, with a motion of\nher fan back towards the room they had left.\n\n\u201cYou have taught him a lesson, Lady Lawless. It is rough on him; but he\nneeds it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope he will do nothing rash,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPerhaps he\u2019ll write some poetry, and refuse to consider his natural\nappetite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you go and see him now?\u201d she asked. \u201cImmediately. Good night, Lady\nLawless.\u201d His big hand swallowed hers in a firm, friendly clasp, and\nhe shook it once or twice before he parted from her. He met Sir Duke\nLawless in the doorway. They greeted cheerfully, and then Lawless came\nup to his wife.\n\n\u201cWell, my dear,\u201d he said, with an amused look in his face, \u201cwell, what\nnews?\u201d\n\nShe lifted her eyebrows at him.\n\n\u201cSomething has happened, Molly, I can see it in your face.\u201d\n\nShe was very brief. \u201cGracia Raglan has been conquered; the young man\nfrom Boston has been foolish; and Mr. Vandewaters has lost millions.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh? That\u2019s awkward,\u201d said Sir Duke.\n\n\u201cWhich?\u201d asked his wife.\n\nVandewaters found Mr. Pride in his bedroom, a waif of melancholy. He\ndrew a chair up, lighted a cigar, eyed the young man from head to foot,\nand then said: \u201cPride, have you got any backbone? If you have, brace up.\nYou are ruined. That\u2019s about as mild as I can put it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know all?\u201d--said the young man helplessly, his hands clasped\nbetween his knees in aesthetic agony.\n\n\u201cYes; I know more than you do, as you will find out. You\u2019re a nice sort\nof man, to come into a man\u2019s house, in a strange land, and make love\nto his wife. Now, what do you think of yourself? You\u2019re a nice\nrepresentative of the American, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI--I didn\u2019t mean any harm--I--couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d replied the stricken\nboy.\n\n\u201cO, for God\u2019s sake, drop that bib-and-tucker twaddle! Couldn\u2019t help it!\nEvery scoundrel, too weak to face the consequences of his sin, says he\ncouldn\u2019t help it. So help me, Joseph, I\u2019d like to thrash you. Couldn\u2019t\nhelp it! Now, sit up in your chair, take this cigar, drink this glass of\nwhiskey I\u2019m pouring for you, and make up your mind that you\u2019re going to\nbe a man and not a nincompoop--sit still! Don\u2019t fly up. I mean what I\nsay. I\u2019ve got business to talk to you. And make up your mind that, for\nonce, you have got to take life seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat right have you to speak to me like this?\u201d demanded the young man\nwith an attempt at dignity. Vandewaters laughed loudly.\n\n\u201cRight? Great Scott! The right of a man who thinks a damned sight more\nof your reputation than you do yourself, and of your fortune than you\nwould ever have wits to do. I am the best friend you\u2019ve got, and not the\nless your friend because I feel like breaking your ribs. Now, enough of\nthat. This is what I have to say, Pride: to-night you and I are beggars.\nYou understand? Beggars. Out in the cold world, out in the street. Now,\nwhat do you think of that?\u201d\n\nThe shock to Mr. Pride was great. Mr. Vandewaters had exaggerated the\ndisaster; but he had done it with a purpose. The youth gasped \u201cMy God!\u201d\n and dropped his glass. Vandewaters picked it up, and regarded him a\nmoment in silence. Then he began to explain their financial position. He\ndid not explain the one bold stroke which he was playing to redeem their\nfortunes: if possible. When he had finished the story, he said, \u201cI guess\nthat\u2019s a bit more serious than the little affair in the library half an\nhour ago?\u201d\n\nHe rose to his feet. \u201cLook here, Pride, be a man. You\u2019ve never tried\nit yet. Let me teach you how to face the world without a dollar; how to\nmake a fortune. Then, when you\u2019ve made it, you\u2019ll get what you\u2019ve never\nhad yet--the pleasure of spending money dug out of your own wits.\u201d\n\nHe carried conviction into a mind not yet all destroyed by effeminacy\nand indulgence of the emotions. Something of the iron of his own brain\ngot into the brain of the young man, who came to his feet trembling a\nlittle, and said: \u201cI don\u2019t mind it so much, if you only stick to me,\nVandewaters.\u201d\n\nA smile flickered about the corners of Vandewaters\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cTake a little more whiskey,\u201d he said; \u201cthen get into bed, and go to\nsleep. No nonsense, remember; go to sleep. To-morrow morning we will\ntalk. And see here, my boy,\u201d--he caught him by both arms and fastened\nhis eyes,--\u201cyou have had a lesson: learn it backwards. Good night.\u201d\n\nNext morning Mr. Vandewaters was early in the grounds. He chatted with\nthe gardener, and discussed the merits of the horses with the groom,\napparently at peace with the world. Yet he was watching vigilantly\nthe carriage-drive from the public-road. Just before breakfast-time a\ntelegraph messenger appeared. Vandewaters was standing with Sir Duke\nLawless when the message was handed to him. He read it, put it into his\npocket, and went on talking. Presently he said: \u201cMy agent is coming\nfrom town this morning, Sir Duke. I may have to leave to-night.\u201d Then he\nturned, and went to his room.\n\nLady Lawless had heard his last words.\n\n\u201cWhat about your ranche in Colorado, Duke?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout as sure, I fancy, as your millionaire for Gracia.\u201d\n\nMiss Raglan did not appear at breakfast with the rest. Neither did Mr.\nPride, who slept late that morning. About ten o\u2019clock Mr. Vandewaters\u2019s\nagent arrived. About twelve o\u2019clock Mr. Vandewaters saw Miss Raglan\nsitting alone in the library. He was evidently looking for her. He came\nup to her quietly, and put a piece of paper in her lap.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked, a little startled.\n\n\u201cA thousand for your hospital,\u201d was the meaning reply.\n\nShe flushed, and came to her feet.\n\n\u201cI have won,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd then he reached out and took both her hands.\n\n\n   ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n   But I don\u2019t think it is worth doing twice\n   He wishes to be rude to some one, and is disappointed\n   I--couldn\u2019t help it\n   Interfere with people who had a trade and didn\u2019t understand it\n   Lose their heads, and be so absurdly earnest\n   Scoundrel, too weak to face the consequences of his sin\n\n\n\n\n",
