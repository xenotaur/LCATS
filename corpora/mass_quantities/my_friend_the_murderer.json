    "body": "\u201cNumber 481 is no better, doctor,\u201d said the head-warder, in a slightly\nreproachful accent, looking in round the corner of my door.\n\n\u201cConfound 481\u201d I responded from behind the pages of the _Australian\nSketcher_.\n\n\u201cAnd 61 says his tubes are paining him. Couldn\u2019t you do anything for\nhim?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a walking drug-shop,\u201d said I. \u201cHe has the whole British\npharmacopa\u00e6 inside him. I believe his tubes are as sound as yours are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s 7 and 108, they are chronic,\u201d continued the warder,\nglancing down a blue slip of paper. \u201cAnd 28 knocked off work\nyesterday--said lifting things gave him a stitch in the side. I want you\nto have a look at him, if you don\u2019t mind, doctor. There\u2019s 81, too--him\nthat killed John Adamson in the Corinthian brig--he\u2019s been carrying on\nawful in the night, shrieking and yelling, he has, and no stopping him\neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll have a look at him afterward,\u201d I said, tossing my paper\ncarelessly aside, and pouring myself out a cup of coffee. \u201cNothing else\nto report, I suppose, warder?\u201d\n\nThe official protruded his head a little further into the room. \u201cBeg\npardon, doctor,\u201d he said, in a confidential tone, \u201cbut I notice as 82\nhas a bit of a cold, and it would be a good excuse for you to visit him\nand have a chat, maybe.\u201d\n\nThe cup of coffee was arrested half-way to my lips as I stared in\namazement at the man\u2019s serious face.\n\n\u201cAn excuse?\u201d I said. \u201cAn excuse? What the deuce are you talking about,\nMcPherson? You see me trudging about all day at my practise, when I\u2019m\nnot looking after the prisoners, and coming back every night as tired as\na dog, and you talk about finding an excuse for doing more work.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like it, doctor,\u201d said Warder McPherson, insinuating one of his\nshoulders into the room. \u201cThat man\u2019s story\u2019s worth listening to if you\ncould get him to tell it, though he\u2019s not what you\u2019d call free in his\nspeech. Maybe you don\u2019t know who 82 is?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t, and I don\u2019t care either,\u201d I answered, in the conviction\nthat some local ruffian was about to be foisted upon me as a celebrity.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Maloney,\u201d said the warder, \u201chim that turned Queen\u2019s evidence after\nthe murders at Bluemansdyke.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say so?\u201d I ejaculated, laying down my cup in astonishment. I\nhad heard of this ghastly series of murders, and read an account of\nthem in a London magazine long before setting foot in the colony. I\nremembered that the atrocities committed had thrown the Burke and Hare\ncrimes completely into the shade, and that one of the most villainous\nof the gang had saved his own skin by betraying his companions. \u201cAre you\nsure?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, it\u2019s him right enough. Just you draw him out a bit, and\nhe\u2019ll astonish you. He\u2019s a man to know, is Maloney; that\u2019s to say, in\nmoderation;\u201d and the head grinned, bobbed, and disappeared, leaving me\nto finish my breakfast and ruminate over what I had heard.\n\nThe surgeonship of an Australian prison is not an enviable position. It\nmay be endurable in Melbourne or Sydney, but the little town of Perth\nhas few attractions to recommend it, and those few had been long\nexhausted. The climate was detestable, and the society far from\ncongenial. Sheep and cattle were the staple support of the community;\nand their prices, breeding, and diseases the principal topic of\nconversation. Now as I, being an outsider, possessed neither the one nor\nthe other, and was utterly callous to the new \u201cdip\u201d and the \u201crot\u201d and\nother kindred topics, I found myself in a state of mental isolation,\nand was ready to hail anything which might relieve the monotony of my\nexistence. Maloney, the murderer, had at least some distinctiveness and\nindividuality in his character, and might act as a tonic to a mind sick\nof the commonplaces of existence. I determined that I should follow the\nwarder\u2019s advice, and take the excuse for making his acquaintance. When,\ntherefore, I went upon my usual matutinal round, I turned the lock of\nthe door which bore the convict\u2019s number upon it, and walked into the\ncell.\n\nThe man was lying in a heap upon his rough bed as I entered, but,\nuncoiling his long limbs, he started up and stared at me with an\ninsolent look of defiance on his face which augured badly for our\ninterview. He had a pale, set face, with sandy hair and a steely-blue\neye, with something feline in its expression. His frame was tall and\nmuscular, though there was a curious bend in his shoulders, which almost\namounted to a deformity. An ordinary observer meeting him in the street\nmight have put him down as a well-developed man, fairly handsome, and\nof studious habits--even in the hideous uniform of the rottenest convict\nestablishment he imparted a certain refinement to his carriage which\nmarked him out among the inferior ruffians around him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on the sick-list,\u201d he said, gruffly. There was something in the\nhard, rasping voice which dispelled all softer illusions, and made me\nrealize that I was face to face with the man of the Lena Valley and\nBluemansdyke, the bloodiest bushranger that ever stuck up a farm or cut\nthe throats of its occupants.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re not,\u201d I answered. \u201cWarder McPherson told me you had a\ncold, though, and I thought I\u2019d look in and see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlast Warder McPherson, and blast you, too!\u201d yelled the convict, in\na paroxysm of rage. \u201cOh, that\u2019s right,\u201d he added in a quieter voice;\n\u201churry away; report me to the governor, do! Get me another six months or\nso--that\u2019s your game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to report you,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cEight square feet of ground,\u201d he went on, disregarding my protest, and\nevidently working himself into a fury again. \u201cEight square feet, and I\ncan\u2019t have that without being talked to and stared at, and--oh, blast\nthe whole crew of you!\u201d and he raised his two clinched hands above, his\nhead and shook them in passionate invective.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a curious idea of hospitality,\u201d I remarked, determined not\nto lose my temper, and saying almost the first thing that came to my\ntongue.\n\nTo my surprise the words had an extraordinary effect upon him. He seemed\ncompletely staggered at my assuming the proposition for which he had\nbeen so fiercely contending--namely, that the room in which he stood was\nhis own.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d he said; \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be rude. Won\u2019t you\ntake a seat?\u201d and he motioned toward a rough trestle, which formed the\nhead-piece of his couch.\n\nI sat down, rather astonished at the sudden change. I don\u2019t know that\nI liked Maloney better under this new aspect. The murderer had, it is\ntrue, disappeared for the nonce, but there was something in the smooth\ntones and obsequious manner which powerfully suggested the witness of\nthe queen, who had stood up and sworn away the lives of his companions\nin crime.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your chest?\u201d I asked, putting on my professional air.\n\n\u201cCome, drop it, doctor--drop it!\u201d he answered, showing a row of white\nteeth as he resumed his seat upon the side of the bed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t\nanxiety after my precious health that brought you along here; that story\nwon\u2019t wash at all. You came to have a look at Wolf Tone Maloney, forger,\nmurderer, Sydney-slider, ranger, and government peach. That\u2019s about my\nfigure, ain\u2019t it? There it is, plain and straight; there\u2019s nothing mean\nabout me.\u201d\n\nHe paused as if he expected me to say something; but as I remained\nsilent, he repeated once or twice, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing mean about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d he suddenly yelled, his eyes gleaming and his\nwhole satanic nature reasserting itself. \u201cWe were bound to swing, one\nand all, and they were none the worse if I saved myself by turning\nagainst them. Every man for himself, say I, and the devil take the\nluckiest. You haven\u2019t a plug of tobacco, doctor, have you?\u201d\n\nHe tore at the piece of \u201cBarrett\u2019s\u201d which I handed him, as ravenously as\na wild beast. It seemed to have the effect of soothing his nerves, for\nhe settled himself down in the bed and re-assumed his former deprecating\nmanner.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like it yourself, you know, doctor,\u201d he said: \u201cit\u2019s enough\nto make any man a little queer in his temper. I\u2019m in for six months this\ntime for assault, and very sorry I shall be to go out again, I can tell\nyou. My mind\u2019s at ease in here; but when I\u2019m outside, what with the\ngovernment and what with Tattooed Tom, of Hawkesbury, there\u2019s no chance\nof a quiet life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the brother of John Grimthorpe, the same that was condemned on my\nevidence; and an infernal scamp he was, too! Spawn of the devil, both of\nthem! This tattooed one is a murderous ruffian, and he swore to have my\nblood after that trial. It\u2019s seven year ago, and he\u2019s following me yet;\nI know he is, though he lies low and keeps dark. He came up to me in\nBallarat in \u201875; you can see on the back of my hand here where the\nbullet clipped me. He tried again in \u201876, at Port Philip, but I got the\ndrop on him and wounded him badly. He knifed me in \u201879, though, in a bar\nat Adelaide, and that made our account about level. He\u2019s loafing round\nagain now, and he\u2019ll let daylight into me--unless--unless by some\nextraordinary chance some one does as much for him.\u201d And Maloney gave a\nvery ugly smile.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t complain of _him_ so much,\u201d he continued. \u201cLooking at it in\nhis way, no doubt it is a sort of family matter that can hardly be\nneglected. It\u2019s the government that fetches me. When I think of what\nI\u2019ve done for this country, and then of what this country has done for\nme, it makes me fairly wild--clean drives me off my head. There\u2019s no\ngratitude nor common decency left, doctor!\u201d\n\nHe brooded over his wrongs for a few minutes, and then proceeded to lay\nthem before me in detail.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s nine men,\u201d he said; \u201cthey\u2019ve been murdering and killing for\na matter of three years, and maybe a life a week wouldn\u2019t more than\naverage the work that they\u2019ve done. The government catches them and the\ngovernment tries them, but they can\u2019t convict; and why?--because the\nwitnesses have all had their throats cut, and the whole job\u2019s been very\nneatly done. What happens then? Up comes a citizen called Wolf Tone\nMaloney; he says, \u2018The country needs me, and here I am.\u2019 And with that\nhe gives his evidence, convicts the lot, and enables the beaks to hang\nthem. That\u2019s what I did. There\u2019s nothing mean about me! And now what\ndoes the country do in return? Dogs me, sir, spies on me, watches me\nnight and day, turns against the very man that worked so very hard for\nit. There\u2019s something mean about that, anyway. I didn\u2019t expect them to\nknight me, nor to make me colonial secretary; but, damn it! I did expect\nthat they would let me alone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I remonstrated, \u201cif you choose to break laws and assault people,\nyou can\u2019t expect it to be looked over on account of former services.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t refer to my present imprisonment, sir,\u201d said Maloney, with\ndignity. \u201cIt\u2019s the life I\u2019ve been leading since that cursed trial that\ntakes the soul out of me. Just you sit there on that trestle, and I\u2019ll\ntell you all about it, and then look me in the face and tell me that\nI\u2019ve been treated fair by the police.\u201d\n\nI shall endeavor to transcribe the experience of the convict in his own\nwords, as far as I can remember them, preserving his curious perversions\nof right and wrong. I can answer for the truth of his facts, whatever\nmay be said for his deductions from them. Months afterward, Inspector H.\nW. Hann, formerly governor of the jail at Dunedin, showed me entries in\nhis ledger which corroborated every statement Maloney reeled the story\noff in a dull, monotonous voice, with his head sunk upon his breast and\nhis hands between his knees. The glitter of his serpentlike eyes was the\nonly sign of the emotions which were stirred up by the recollection of\nthe events which he narrated.\n\n*****\n\nYou\u2019ve read of Bluemansdyke (he began, with some pride in his tone).\nWe made it hot while it lasted; but they ran us to earth at last, and a\ntrap called Braxton, with a damned Yankee, took the lot of us. That was\nin New Zealand, of course, and they took us down to Dunedin, and there\nthey were convicted and hanged. One and all they put up their hands\nin the dock, and cursed me till your blood would have run cold to hear\nthem--which was scurvy treatment, seeing that we had all been\npals together; but they were a blackguard lot, and thought only of\nthemselves. I think it is as well that they were hung.\n\nThey took me back to Dunedin Jail, and clapped me into the old cell.\nThe only difference they made was, that I had no work to do and was\nwell fed. I stood this for a week or two, until one day the governor was\nmaking his rounds, and I put the matter to him.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d I said. \u201cMy conditions were a free pardon, and you\u2019re\nkeeping me here against the law.\u201d\n\nHe gave a sort of a smile. \u201cShould you like very much to get out?\u201d he\nasked.\n\n\u201cSo much,\u201d said I, \u201cthat unless you open that door I\u2019ll have an action\nagainst you for illegal detention.\u201d\n\nHe seemed a bit astonished by my resolution.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re very anxious to meet your death,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cCome here, and you\u2019ll know what I mean,\u201d he answered. And he led me\ndown the passage to a window that overlooked the door of the prison.\n\u201cLook at that!\u201d said he.\n\nI looked out, and there were a dozen or so rough-looking fellows\nstanding outside the street, some of them smoking, some playing cards\non the pavement. When they saw me they gave a yell and crowded round the\ndoor, shaking their fists and hooting.\n\n\u201cThey wait for you, watch and watch about,\u201d said the governor. \u201cThey\u2019re\nthe executive of the vigilance committee. However, since you are\ndetermined to go, I can\u2019t stop you.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019ye call this a civilized land,\u201d I cried, \u201cand let a man be murdered\nin cold blood in open daylight?\u201d\n\nWhen I said this the governor and the warder and every fool in the place\ngrinned, as if a man\u2019s life was a rare good joke.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the law on your side,\u201d says the governor; \u201cso we won\u2019t\ndetain you any longer. Show him out, warder.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d have done it, too, the black-hearted villain, if I hadn\u2019t begged\nand prayed and offered to pay for my board and lodging, which is\nmore than any prisoner ever did before me. He let me stay on those\nconditions; and for three months I was caged up there with every\nlarrikin in the township clamoring at the other side of the wall. That\nwas pretty treatment for a man that had served his country!\n\nAt last, one morning up came the governor again.\n\n\u201cWell, Maloney,\u201d he said, \u201chow long are you going to honor us with your\nsociety?\u201d\n\nI could have put a knife into his cursed body, and would, too, if we had\nbeen alone in the bush; but I had to smile, and smooth him and flatter,\nfor I feared that he might have me sent out.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an infernal rascal,\u201d he said; those were his very words, to a\nman that had helped him all he knew how. \u201cI don\u2019t want any rough justice\nhere, though; and I think I see my way to getting you out of Dunedin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget you, governor,\u201d said I; \u201cand, by God! I never will.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your thanks nor your gratitude,\u201d he answered; \u201cit\u2019s\nnot for your sake that I do it, but simply to keep order in the town.\nThere\u2019s a steamer starts from the West Quay to Melbourne to-morrow, and\nwe\u2019ll get you aboard it. She is advertised at five in the morning, so\nhave yourself in readiness.\u201d\n\nI packed up the few things I had, and was smuggled out by a back door,\njust before daybreak. I hurried down, took my ticket under the name\nof Isaac Smith, and got safely aboard the Melbourne boat. I remember\nhearing her screw grinding into the water as the warps were cast loose,\nand looking back at the lights of Dunedin as I leaned upon the bulwarks,\nwith the pleasant thought that I was leaving them behind me forever.\nIt seemed to me that a new world was before me, and that all my troubles\nhad been cast off. I went down below and had some coffee, and came up\nagain feeling better than I had done since the morning that I woke\nto find that cursed Irishman that took me standing over me with a\nsix-shooter.\n\nDay had dawned by that time, and we were steaming along by the coast,\nwell out of sight of Dunedin. I loafed about for a couple of hours, and\nwhen the sun got well up some of the other passengers came on deck and\njoined me. One of them, a little perky sort of fellow, took a good long\nlook at me, and then came over and began talking.\n\n\u201cMining, I suppose?\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I says.\n\n\u201cMade your pile?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cPretty fair,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cI was at it myself,\u201d he says; \u201cI worked at the Nelson fields for three\nmonths, and spent all I made in buying a salted claim which busted up\nthe second day. I went at it again, though, and struck it rich; but when\nthe gold wagon was going down to the settlements, it was stuck up by\nthose cursed rangers, and not a red cent left.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a bad job,\u201d I says.\n\n\u201cBroke me--ruined me clean. Never mind, I\u2019ve seen them all hanged for\nit; that makes it easier to bear. There\u2019s only one left--the villain\nthat gave the evidence. I\u2019d die happy if I could come across him. There\nare two things I have to do if I meet him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d says I, carelessly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to ask him where the money lies--they never had time to make\naway with it, and it\u2019s _cach\u00e9d_ somewhere in the mountains--and then\nI\u2019ve got to stretch his neck for him, and send his soul down to join the\nmen that he betrayed.\u201d\n\nIt seemed to me that I knew something about that _cach\u00e9_, and I felt\nlike laughing; but he was watching me, and it struck me that he had a\nnasty, vindictive kind of mind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going up on the bridge,\u201d I said, for he was not a man whose\nacquaintance I cared much about making.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t hear of my leaving him, though. \u201cWe\u2019re both miners,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cand we\u2019re pals for the voyage. Come down to the bar. I\u2019m not too\npoor to shout.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t refuse him well, and we went down together; and that was the\nbeginning of the trouble. What harm was I doing any one on the ship?\nAll I asked for was a quiet life, leaving others alone and getting left\nalone myself. No man could ask fairer than that. And now just you listen\nto what came of it.\n\nWe were passing the front of the ladies\u2019 cabin, on our way to\nthe saloon, when out comes a servant lass--a freckled currency\nshe-devil--with a baby in her arms. We were brushing past her, when she\ngave a scream like a railway whistle, and nearly dropped the kid. My\nnerves gave a sort of a jump when I heard that scream, but I turned and\nbegged her pardon, letting on that I thought I might have trod on her\nfoot. I knew the game was up, though, when I saw her white face, and her\nleaning against the door and pointing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d she cried; \u201cit\u2019s him! I saw him in the court-house. Oh,\ndon\u2019t let him hurt the baby!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked the steward and half a dozen others in a breath.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s him--Maloney--Maloney, the murderer--oh, take him away--take him\naway!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t rightly remember what happened just at that moment. The\nfurniture and me seemed to get kind of mixed, and there was cursing,\nand smashing, and some one shouting for his gold, and a general stamping\nround. When I got steadied a bit, I found somebody\u2019s hand in my mouth.\nFrom what I gathered afterward, I concluded that it belonged to that\nsame little man with the vicious way of talking. He got some of it out\nagain, but that was because the others were choking me. A poor chap can\nget no fair play in this world when once he is down--still, I think he\nwill remember me till the day of his death--longer, I hope.\n\nThey dragged me out on to the poop and held a damned court-martial--on\n_me_, mind you; _me_, that had thrown over my pals in order to serve\nthem. What were they to do with me? Some said this, some said that; but\nit ended by the captain deciding to send me ashore. The ship stopped,\nthey lowered a boat, and I was hoisted in, the whole gang of them\nhooting at me from over the bulwarks, I saw the man I spoke of tying up\nhis hand, though, and I felt that things might be worse.\n\nI changed my opinion before we got to the land. I had reckoned on the\nshore being deserted, and that I might make my way inland; but the ship\nhad stopped too near the Heads, and a dozen beach-combers and such like\nhad come down to the water\u2019s edge and were staring at us, wondering what\nthe boat was after. When we got to the edge of the surf the cockswain\nhailed them, and after singing out who I was, he and his men threw me\ninto the water. You may well look surprised--neck and crop into ten feet\nof water, with sharks as thick as green parrots in the bush, and I heard\nthem laughing as I floundered to the shore.\n\nI soon saw it was a worse job than ever. As I came scrambling out\nthrough the weeds, I was collared by a big chap with a velveteen coat,\nand half a dozen others got round me and held me fast. Most of them\nlooked simple fellows enough, and I was not afraid of them; but there\nwas one in a cabbage-tree hat that had a very nasty expression on his\nface, and the big man seemed to be chummy with him.\n\nThey dragged me up the beach, and then they let go their hold of me and\nstood round in a circle.\n\n\u201cWell, mate,\u201d says the man with the hat, \u201cwe\u2019ve been looking out for you\nsome time in these parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd very good of you, too,\u201d I answers.\n\n\u201cNone of your jaw,\u201d says he. \u201cCome, boys, what shall it be--hanging,\ndrowning, or shooting? Look sharp!\u201d\n\nThis looked a bit too like business. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t!\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve got\ngovernment protection, and it\u2019ll be murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they call it,\u201d answered the one in the velveteen coat, as\ncheery as a piping crow.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to murder me for being a ranger?\u201d\n\n\u201cRanger be damned!\u201d said the man. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hang you for peaching\nagainst your pals; and that\u2019s an end of the palaver.\u201d\n\nThey slung a rope round my neck and dragged me up to the edge of the\nbush. There were some big she-oaks and blue-gums, and they pitched on\none of these for the wicked deed. They ran the rope over a branch, tied\nmy hands, and told me to say my prayers. It seemed as if it was all up;\nbut Providence interfered to save me. It sounds nice enough sitting here\nand telling about it, sir; but it was sick work to stand with nothing\nbut the beach in front of you, and the long white line of surf, with the\nsteamer in the distance, and a set of bloody-minded villains round you\nthirsting for your life.\n\nI never thought I\u2019d owe anything good to the police; but they saved\nme that time. A troop of them were riding from Hawkes Point Station to\nDunedin, and hearing that something was up, they came down through the\nbush and interrupted the proceedings. I\u2019ve heard some bands in my time,\ndoctor, but I never heard music like the jingle of those traps\u2019 spurs\nand harness as they galloped out on to the open. They tried to hang me\neven then, but the police were too quick for them; and the man with the\nhat got one over the head with the flat of a sword. I was clapped on\nto a horse, and before evening I found myself in my old quarters in the\ncity jail.\n\nThe governor wasn\u2019t to be done, though. He was determined to get rid of\nme, and I was equally anxious to see the last of him. He waited a week\nor so until the excitement had begun to die away, and then he smuggled\nme aboard a three-masted schooner bound to Sydney with tallow and hides.\n\nWe got far away to sea without a hitch, and things began to look a bit\nmore rosy. I made sure that I had seen the last of the prison, anyway.\nThe crew had a sort of an idea who I was, and if there\u2019d been any rough\nweather, they\u2019d have hove me overboard, like enough; for they were a\nrough, ignorant lot, and had a notion that I brought bad luck to the\nship. We had a good passage, however, and I was landed safe and sound\nupon Sydney Quay.\n\nNow just you listen to what happened next. You\u2019d have thought they would\nhave been sick of ill-using me and following me by this time--wouldn\u2019t\nyou, now? Well, just you listen. It seems that a cursed steamer started\nfrom Dunedin to Sydney on the very day we left, and got in before\nus, bringing news that I was coming. Blessed if they hadn\u2019t called a\nmeeting--a regular mass-meeting--at the docks to discuss about it, and\nI marched right into it when I landed. They didn\u2019t take long about\narresting me, and I listened to all the speeches and resolutions. If I\u2019d\nbeen a prince there couldn\u2019t have been more excitement. The end of all\nwas that they agreed that it wasn\u2019t right that New Zealand should be\nallowed to foist her criminals upon her neighbors, and that I was to be\nsent back again by the next boat. So they posted me off again as if\nI was a damned parcel; and after another eight-hundred-mile journey I\nfound myself back for the third time moving in the place that I started\nfrom.\n\nBy this time I had begun to think that I was going to spend the rest of\nmy existence traveling about from one port to another. Every man\u2019s\nhand seemed turned against me, and there was no peace or quiet in any\ndirection. I was about sick of it by the time I had come back; and if\nI could have taken to the bush I\u2019d have done it, and chanced it with my\nold pals. They were too quick for me, though, and kept me under lock and\nkey; but I managed, in spite of them, to negotiate that _cach\u00e9_ I told\nyou of, and sewed the gold up in my belt. I spent another month in jail,\nand then they slipped me aboard a bark that was bound for England.\n\nThis time the crew never knew who I was, but the captain had a pretty\ngood idea, though he didn\u2019t let on to me that he had any suspicions.\nI guessed from the first that the man was a villain. We had a fair\npassage, except a gale or two off the Cape; and I began to feel like\na free man when I saw the blue loom of the old country, and the saucy\nlittle pilot-boat from Falmouth dancing toward us over the waves. We ran\ndown the Channel, and before we reached Gravesend I had agreed with the\npilot that he should take me ashore with him when he left. It was at\nthis time that the captain showed me that I was right in thinking him a\nmeddling, disagreeable man. I got my things packed, such as they were,\nand left him talking earnestly to the pilot, while I went below for my\nbreakfast. When I came up again we were fairly into the mouth of the\nriver, and the boat in which I was to have gone ashore had left us. The\nskipper said the pilot had forgotten me; but that was too thin, and I\nbegan to fear that all my old troubles were going to commence once more.\n\nIt was not long before my suspicions were confirmed. A boat darted out\nfrom the side of the river, and a tall cove with a long black beard came\naboard. I heard him ask the mate whether they didn\u2019t need a mud-pilot to\ntake them up in the reaches, but it seemed to me that he was a man who\nwould know a deal more about handcuffs than he did about steering, so\nI kept away from him. He came across the deck, however, and made\nsome remark to me, taking a good look at me the while. I don\u2019t like\ninquisitive people at any time, but an inquisitive stranger with glue\nabout the roots of his beard is the worst of all to stand, especially\nunder the circumstances. I began to feel that it was time for me to go.\n\nI soon got a chance, and made good use of it. A big collier came athwart\nthe bows of our steamer, and we had to slacken down to dead slow. There\nwas a barge astern, and I slipped down by a rope and was into the barge\nbefore any one missed me. Of course I had to leave my luggage behind me,\nbut I had the belt with the nuggets round my waist, and the chance of\nshaking the police off my track was worth more than a couple of boxes.\nIt was clear to me now that the pilot had been a traitor, as well as the\ncaptain, and had set the detectives after me. I often wish I could drop\nacross those two men again.\n\nI hung about the barge all day as she drifted down the stream. There was\none man in her, but she was a big, ugly craft, and his hands were too\nfull for much looking about. Toward evening, when it got a bit dusky, I\nstruck out for the shore, and found myself in a sort of marsh place, a\ngood many miles to the east of London. I was soaking wet and half\ndead with hunger, but I trudged into the town, got a new rig-out at a\nslop-shop, and after having some supper, engaged a bed at the quietest\nlodgings I could find.\n\nI woke pretty early--a habit you pick up in the bush--and lucky for me\nthat I did so. The very first thing I saw when I took a look through a\nchink in the shutter was one of these infernal policemen standing right\nopposite and staring up at the windows. He hadn\u2019t epaulets nor a sword,\nlike our traps, but for all that there was a sort of family likeness,\nand the same busybody expression. Whether they followed me all the time,\nor whether the woman that let me the bed didn\u2019t like the looks of me,\nis more than I have ever been able to find out. He came across as I was\nwatching him, and noted down the address of the house in a book. I was\nafraid that he was going to ring at the bell, but I suppose his orders\nwere simply to keep an eye on me, for after another good look at the\nwindows he moved on down the street.\n\nI saw that my only chance was to act at once. I threw on my clothes,\nopened the window softly, and, after making sure that there was nobody\nabout, dropped out onto the ground and made off as hard as I could run.\nI traveled a matter of two or three miles, when my wind gave out; and\nas I saw a big building with people going in and out, I went in too,\nand found that it was a railway station. A train was just going off\nfor Dover to meet the French boat, so I took a ticket and jumped into a\nthird-class carriage.\n\nThere were a couple of other chaps in the carriage, innocent-looking\nyoung beggars, both of them. They began speaking about this and that,\nwhile I sat quiet in the corner and listened. Then they started on\nEngland and foreign countries, and such like. Look ye now, doctor, this\nis a fact. One of them begins jawing about the justice of England\u2019s\nlaws. \u201cIt\u2019s all fair and above-board,\u201d says he; \u201cthere ain\u2019t any secret\npolice, nor spying, like they have abroad,\u201d and a lot more of the same\nsort of wash. Rather rough on me, wasn\u2019t it, listening to the damned\nyoung fool, with the police following me about like my shadow?\n\nI got to Paris right enough, and there I changed some of my gold, and\nfor a few days I imagined I\u2019d shaken them off, and began to think of\nsettling down for a bit of rest. I needed it by that time, for I was\nlooking more like a ghost than a man. You\u2019ve never had the police after\nyou, I suppose? Well, you needn\u2019t look offended, I didn\u2019t mean any harm.\nIf ever you had you\u2019d know that it wastes a man away like a sheep with\nthe rot.\n\nI went to the opera one night and took a box, for I was very flush. I\nwas coming out between the acts when I met a fellow lounging along\nin the passage. The light fell on his face, and I saw that it was the\nmud-pilot that had boarded us in the Thames. His beard was gone, but I\nrecognized the man at a glance, for I\u2019ve a good memory for faces.\n\nI tell you, doctor, I felt desperate for a moment. I could have knifed\nhim if we had been alone, but he knew me well enough never to give me\nthe chance. It was more than I could stand any longer, so I went right\nup to him and drew him aside, where we\u2019d be free from all the loungers\nand theater-goers.\n\n\u201cHow long are you going to keep it up?\u201d I asked him.\n\nHe seemed a bit flustered for a moment, but then he saw there was no use\nbeating about the bush, so he answered straight:\n\n\u201cUntil you go back to Australia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know,\u201d I said, \u201cthat I have served the government and got a\nfree pardon?\u201d\n\nHe grinned all over his ugly face when I said this.\n\n\u201cWe know all about you, Maloney,\u201d he answered. \u201cIf you want a quiet\nlife, just you go back where you came from. If you stay here, you\u2019re a\nmarked man; and when you are found tripping it\u2019ll be a lifer for you,\nat the least. Free trade\u2019s a fine thing but the market\u2019s too full of men\nlike you for us to need to import any.\u201d\n\nIt seemed to me that there was something in what he said, though he had\na nasty way of putting it. For some days back I\u2019d been feeling a sort of\nhomesick. The ways of the people weren\u2019t my ways. They stared at me in\nthe street; and if I dropped into a bar, they\u2019d stop talking and edge\naway a bit, as if I was a wild beast. I\u2019d sooner have had a pint of old\nStringybark, too, than a bucketful of their rot-gut liquors. There\nwas too much damned propriety. What was the use of having money if you\ncouldn\u2019t dress as you liked, nor bust in properly? There was no sympathy\nfor a man if he shot about a little when he was half-over, I\u2019ve seen a\nman dropped at Nelson many a time with less row than they\u2019d make over a\nbroken window-pane. The thing was slow, and I was sick of it.\n\n\u201cYou want me to go back?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve my order to stick fast to you until you do,\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t care if I do. All I bargain is that you keep\nyour mouth shut and don\u2019t let on who I am, so that I may have a fair\nstart when I get there.\u201d\n\nHe agreed to this, and we went over to Southampton the very next\nday, where he saw me safely off once more. I took a passage round to\nAdelaide, where no one was likely to know me; and there I settled, right\nunder the nose of the police. I\u2019d been there ever since, leading a quiet\nlife, but for little difficulties like the one I\u2019m in for now, and for\nthat devil, Tattooed Tom, of Hawkesbury. I don\u2019t know what made me\ntell you all this, doctor, unless it is that being lonely makes a man\ninclined to jaw when he gets a chance. Just you take warning from me,\nthough. Never put yourself out to serve your country; for your country\nwill do precious little for you. Just you let them look after their own\naffairs; and if they find difficulty in hanging a set of scoundrels,\nnever mind chipping in, but let them alone to do as best they can. Maybe\nthey\u2019ll remember how they treated me after I\u2019m dead, and be sorry for\nneglecting me, I was rude to you when you came in, and swore a trifle\npromiscuous: but don\u2019t you mind me, it\u2019s only my way. You\u2019ll allow,\nthough, that I have cause to be a bit touchy now and again when I think\nof all that\u2019s passed. You\u2019re not going, are you? Well, if you must, you\nmust; but I hope you will look me up at odd times when you are going\nyour rounds. Oh, I say, you\u2019ve left the balance of that cake of tobacco\nbehind you, haven\u2019t you? No; it\u2019s in your pocket--that\u2019s all right.\nThank ye, doctor, you\u2019re a good sort, and as quick at a hint as any man\nI\u2019ve met.\n\nA couple of months after narrating his experiences, Wolf Tone Maloney\nfinished his term, and was released. For a long time I neither saw him\nnor heard of him, and he had almost slipped from my memory, until I\nwas reminded, in a somewhat tragic manner, of his existence. I had been\nattending a patient some distance off in the country, and was riding\nback, guiding my tired horse among the boulders which strewed the\npathway, and endeavoring to see my way through the gathering darkness,\nwhen I came suddenly upon a little wayside inn. As I walked my horse up\ntoward the door, intending to make sure of my bearings before proceeding\nfurther, I heard the sound of a violent altercation within the little\nbar.\n\nThere seemed to be a chorus of expostulation or remonstrance, above\nwhich two powerful voices rang out loud and angry. As I listened, there\nwas a momentary hush, two pistol shots sounded almost simultaneously,\nand with a crash the door burst open and a pair of dark figures\nstaggered out into the moonlight. They struggled for a moment in a\ndeadly wrestle, and then went down together among the loose stones.\nI had sprung off my horse, and, with the help of half a dozen rough\nfellows from the bar, dragged them away from one another.\n\nA glance was sufficient to convince me that one of them was dying fast.\nHe was a thick-set burly fellow, with a determined cast of countenance.\nThe blood was welling from a deep stab in his throat, and it was evident\nthat an important artery had been divided. I turned away from him in\ndespair, and walked over to where his antagonist was lying. He was shot\nthrough the lungs, but managed to raise himself up on his hand as I\napproached, and peered anxiously up into my face. To my surprise, I\nsaw before me the haggard features and flaxen hair of my prison\nacquaintance, Maloney.\n\n\u201cAh, doctor!\u201d he said, recognizing me. \u201cHow is he? Will he die?\u201d\n\nHe asked the question so earnestly that I imagined he had softened at\nthe last moment, and feared to leave the world with another homicide\nupon his conscience. Truth, however, compelled me to shake my head\nmournfully, and to intimate that the wound would prove a mortal one.\n\nMaloney gave a wild cry of triumph, which brought the blood welling\nout from between his lips. \u201cHere, boys,\u201d he gasped to the little group\naround him. \u201cThere\u2019s money in my inside pocket. Damn the expense! Drinks\nround. There\u2019s nothing mean about me. I\u2019d drink with you, but I\u2019m going.\nGive the doc my share, for he\u2019s as good--\u201d Here his head fell back\nwith a thud, his eye glazed, and the soul of Wolf Tone Maloney, forger,\nconvict, ranger, murderer, and government peach, drifted away into the\nGreat Unknown.\n\nI cannot conclude without borrowing the account of the fatal quarrel\nwhich appeared in the column of the _West Australian Sentinel_. The\ncurious will find it in the issue of October 4,1881:\n\n     \u201cFatal Affray.--W. T. Maloney, a well-know citizen of New\n     Montrose, and proprietor of the Yellow Boy gambling saloon,\n     has met with his death under rather painful circumstances.\n     Mr. Maloney was a man who had led a checkered existence, and\n     whose past history is replete with interest. Some of our\n     readers may recall the Lena Valley murders, in which he\n     figured as the principal criminal. It is conjectured that\n     during the seven months that he owned a bar in that region,\n     from twenty to thirty travelers were hocussed and made away\n     with.   He succeeded, however, in evading the vigilance of\n     the officers of the law, and allied himself with the\n     bushrangers of Bluemansdyke, whose heroic capture and\n     subsequent execution are matters of history. Maloney\n     extricated himself from the fate which awaited him by\n     turning Queen\u2019s evidence. He afterward visited Europe, but\n     returned to West Australia, where he has long played a\n     prominent part in local matters. On Friday evening he\n     encountered an old enemy, Thomas Grimthorpe, commonly known\n     as Tattooed Tom, of Hawkesbury.\n\n     \u201cShots were exchanged, and both were badly wounded, only\n     surviving a few minutes. Mr. Maloney had the reputation of\n     being not only the most wholesale murderer that ever lived,\n     but also of having a finish and attention to detail in\n     matters of evidence which has been unapproached by any\n     European criminal. _Sic transit gloria mundi!_\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",
