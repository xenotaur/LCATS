Are you game?\u201d Charley O\u2019Mara, sixty-five years old, bent,\nbroken, and bitter at the law, coughed a warning. He raised his pick\nand started digging around a flower-bed.\n\nA guard in a heavy raincoat, carrying a dripping rifle, came toward\nthe two prisoners. He stopped a few feet away from Fay.\n\n\u201cQuit that talkin\u2019!\u201d he snarled. \u201cI\u2019ll chalk you in if I see any more\nof it!\u201d\n\nFay did not answer the guard. He spaded the earth, dug deep, tossed\nthe shovelfuls to one side and waited until the guard had strolled\nwithin the shelter of a low shed.\n\n\u201cCharley!\u201d he continued without moving his lips. \u201cListen, old pal.\nSee that motortruck near the shed?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it, Chester.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee where the screw is standing?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s watching us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m watching him, Charley. We can beat this stir in an hour. Do\nyou want to try it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow you going to do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you follow me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, pal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait till it gets a little darker. Then we\u2019ll take the chance.\u201d\n\nThe prison guard stood with his rifle lowered to the moist earth\nbeneath the shed. His eyes ranged from the two convicts to the wall\nupon which were other guards sheltered in tiny guardhouses. He yawned\nand drowsed, standing.\n\nFay worked in a slow circle. He had seen the auto-truck come into the\nprison yard at noon. It was part of the road-gang\u2019s outfit. There was\nno road-work that day, on account of the rain. The inmate driver had\ngone into the cellhouse.\n\nOld Charley O\u2019Mara let his pick dig into the earth with feeble\nstrokes. He paused at times. There was that to Fay\u2019s actions which\npresaged much. The gray-haired young man was gradually closing in on\nthe drowsing guard. He was like a lean panther getting ready for a\nspring.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe attack came with lightninglike suddenness. Fay dropped his\nshovel, crossed the earth, struck the guard a short-arm uppercut and\nbore him down to earth, where he smothered his cries with a flap of\nthe raincoat.\n\nCharley O\u2019Mara came limping toward the shed.\n\n\u201cGet a rope!\u201d snapped Fay. \u201cI don\u2019t want to croak him.\u201d\n\n\u201cCroakin\u2019s too good for the likes of him, Chester.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet a rope. We\u2019ve got about fifteen minutes to work in. We ought to\nbe beyond the wall by then.\u201d\n\nFay worked quickly. He took the rope the old convict found, and\ntrussed the guard, after taking off the raincoat. He made sure that\nthe man would make no outcry. He fastened a stick in his mouth and\ntied it behind his head. He rose and glanced through the down-pouring\nrain.\n\n\u201cI knocked him out,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, Charley, put on that raincoat,\ntake the cap and rifle and walk slowly toward the auto-truck. Get in\nthe front. Stand up like a guard.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they might know me!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wont know you. It\u2019s raining. The screws on the wall will think\nyou are taking the truck out, by order of the warden. I\u2019ll drive. An\ninmate always drives.\u201d\n\nThe guard who sat huddled in the little house which loomed over the\ngreat gate at Rockglen rose, opened a small window and glanced out as\nhe heard the motortruck mounting the grade from the prison yard. He\nsaw what he thought was the figure of a guard standing by a convict.\nThe convict crouched with partly hidden face over the steering-wheel.\n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d shouted Charley O\u2019Mara, motioning with his rifle toward\nthe closed gate.\n\nThe guard squinted for a second time. He caught, through the rain,\nthe gleam of brass on the cap Charley wore. He saw the rifle. He\nreached and pulled at a lever. The gate slowly opened, first to a\ncrack, then wide. Fay pressed forward the clutch pedal, shifted from\nneutral to first speed, stepped on the accelerator and let the clutch\npedal up gently.\n\nThe truck mounted the top of the grade, churned through the gate,\nturned in front of the warden\u2019s house and took the incline which led\nover the hill from Rockglen.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll might have gone well for the convicts had it not been for the\nrain. Water had formed in deep pools along the road. Into these pools\nFay guided the clumsy truck. He heard the engine miss an explosion. A\nsputter followed. The truck slowed. An explosion sounded in the\nmuffler. The insulation wires grounded and short-circuited. The truck\nstopped.\n\nFay sprang from the driver\u2019s seat and opened the hood. He attempted\nto find the trouble. A dangling wire, touching the engine\u2019s frame,\nwas sodden with water.\n\n\u201cNo go!\u201d he said to Charley. \u201cCome on! We\u2019ll leave the truck and take\nto the woods. That means a chase as soon as the big whistle blows.\u201d\n\nThe two convicts were crossing an open field when they heard the\nfirst menacing blasts from the prison siren. They ran for shelter. A\ndog barked. A farmhand came through the underbrush. He stood\nwatching.\n\n\u201cKeep your nerve!\u201d said Fay. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the rifle. Night is coming\non. Follow me.\u201d\n\nThe trail led away from Rockglen. Fay sensed the general direction.\nHe attempted to gain a railroad junction where a freight could be\ntaken for Chicago. He was headed off by a motorcar load of prison\nguards. He saw the danger in time.\n\n\u201cTo the right,\u201d he whispered to O\u2019Mara. \u201cFollow me. Don\u2019t cave, pal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all in,\u201d sobbed the old convict.\n\nFay braced his arm beneath Charlie\u2019s elbow. He took the rifle. They\ncrossed a swollen brook, broke through the hedge of a vast estate and\ncame suddenly upon a trio of watchmen who had been alarmed by the\nblowing of the prison\u2019s siren.\n\nThe fight that followed was entirely onesided. Fay pumped lead in the\ngeneral direction of the watchmen. He was answered by a salvo.\nCrimson cones splashed the night. Bullets whined. A shout sounded far\naway. Other watchmen and constables were surrounding the estate.\n\nOld Charley O\u2019Mara, crouching in the shelter of a hawthorn clump,\ncoughed, rose, spun and fell face downward. A great spot of scarlet\nran over the raincoat. His aged face twisted in agony. Fay knelt by\nhis side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m croaked, pal,\u201d said the convict. \u201cThey winged me through the\nlungs. Good-by, pal.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything I can do, Charley?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll get away?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo Chi?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you go see my little girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the Dropper\u2019s, on Harrison Street. She\u2019s in bad, Chester. Take\nher away from them low-brows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow old is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cSixteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is her name?\u201d\n\n\u201cEmily--little Emily.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her, Charley. I promise you that!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nFay let the convict\u2019s head drop to the ground. He heard the\ndeath-rattle. He kicked aside the empty and useless rifle.\n\nThe way of escape was not an easy one. Forms moved in the mist. He\ndarted for a row of bushes. He crawled beneath them. He gained the\nhigh fence around the estate, where, freed of the necessity of\nsetting his pace to that of the old convict, he broke through the\nfar-flung cordon of guards and watchmen and gained a woods which\nextended north and west for over a score of miles.\n\nHe discovered, toward morning, a small house in course of erection.\nIts scaffolding stood gaunt against the velvet of the sky. A\ncarpenter\u2019s chest rested on the back porch.\n\nFay pried this open with a hatchet, removed a suit of overalls and a\nsaw, and dropped the lid. He emerged from the woods, looking for all\nthe world like a carpenter going to work.\n\nTo the man who had wolfed the world--to the third cracksman then\nliving--the remainder of his get-away to Chicago was a journey wherein\neach detail fitted in with the others.\n\nHe arrived--after riding in gondola-cars, hugging the tops of Pullmans\nand helping stoke an Atlantic type locomotive--at the first fringe of\nthe city of many millions.\n\nWith sharp eyes before him, and dodging police-haunted streets, he\nmingled with the workers--seemingly a carpenter.\n\nNo one of all the throng seemed to notice him. He walked slowly at\ntimes. He thought of old Charley O\u2019Mara, and of the dying convict\u2019s\nrequest.\n\nA speck in the yeast, a chip on the foam, he quickened his steps and\nentered a small pawnshop where money could be borrowed for\nenterprises of a shady nature.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nMother Madlebaum peered over the counter at the gray-haired young man\nwho held out an empty palm and asked for a loan on a mythical watch.\nShe removed her spectacles, polished them with her black alpaca\napron, and glanced shrewdly toward the door.\n\n\u201cWhat a start you gave me, Chester. And me thinking all along you\nwere lagged.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive C\u2019s on the block,\u201d laughed Fay pleasantly. \u201cRemember the\nblue-white gems I brought you last time? Remember the swag, loot and\nplunder from the Hanover job? You made big on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always do with your stuff, Chester.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you lend me five hundred? I\u2019ve just beaten stir.\u201d\n\nThe old fence opened her safe and brought forth a money-drawer. Fay\ntook the bills she handed to him, without counting them. He touched\nhis hat and started toward the door.\n\n\u201cWait, Chester.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWant to plant upstairs till the blow is over?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I promised old Charley O\u2019Mara I\u2019d see his girl for him. Poor\nCharley is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in your class, Chester. Nobody is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the Dropper\u2019s scatter?\u201d\n\n\u201cFive doors from the corner, on Harrison Street. Is the girl there?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen may God help her. You can\u2019t!\u201d\n\nFay passed from the fence and lost himself in the clothing-department\nof a dry-goods store. He entered the place a carpenter--down in the\nheels and somewhat grimy from his train-ride. He emerged with a\nbamboo cane hooked over the sleeve of a shepherd-plaid suit. His hat\nwas a flat-brimmed Panama, his shoes correct.\n\nA bath, shave, shampoo and haircut completed his metamorphosis. He\nleft a barber-shop--the proper figure of a young man. He walked\nbriskly, seeing everything.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were detectives in that city--discerning ones. He avoided the\nmain streets and crossings. Wolf-keen and alert for the police, he\nturned toward the dive where little Emily O\u2019Mara lived. He distrusted\nthe place and cursed himself for the venture.\n\nThe Dropper\u2019s reputation among the powers that preyed was--unsavory.\nThere had been rumors in the old days that he was a pigeon. The den\nand joint he managed sheltered cheap dips, pennyweighters and\nstore-histers who bragged of their miserable exploits.\n\nFay entered the hallway that led up to the Dropper\u2019s, like a duke\npaying a visit to a tenement.\n\nA gas-light flared the second landing. An ash-can, half filled with\nempty bottles, marked the third. Fay paused by this can, studied a\nfist-banged door, then knocked with light knuckles.\n\nAs he waited for a chain to be unhooked and a slide to open, he\nsniffed the air of the hallway. Somewhere, some one was smoking\nopium.\n\nA brutish, shelving-browed, scar-crossed face appeared at the\nopening. Steely eyes drilled toward the cracksman.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019ye want here?\u201d\n\n\u201cGee sip en quessen, hop en yen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho to hell are yuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cA friend,\u201d said Fay. \u201cA man to see Charley O\u2019Mara\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n\nFay carried no revolver. He scorned such things. The police rated him\ntoo clever to commit murder. Only amateurs and coke-fiends did things\nlike that.\n\nHe wished, however, that he could thrust the blued-steel muzzle of a\ngat through the panel and order the Dropper to unlatch the door. The\nthug was so long in making up his none-too-alert mind.\n\nIt swung finally. Fay stepped into the room. He narrowed his eyes and\nmentally photographed a mean den, made translucent by the\ngreenish-hued smoke that swirled over a peanut-oil lamp and floated\nbefore the drawn faces of many poppy-dreamers who were peering from\nbunks.\n\nThe Dropper stood waiting. His elbows were slightly bent. His huge,\nbroken-boned hands came slowly in front. He measured Fay from the tip\nof the shoes to the prematurely gray hair that showed beneath the\ncracksman\u2019s straw hat.\n\n\u201cWell, when did you get out of stir?\u201d he snarled with sudden\nrecognition. \u201cI thought they threw the key away on yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy, Dropper! Who are all these people?\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, they\u2019re all right! There\u2019s Canada Mac and Glycerine Jimmy an\u2019\nthree broads over there. Then there\u2019s Mike the Bike and Micky Gleason\nwith us to-night. Know them?\u201d\n\nFay unhooked his cane from his arm. He swung it back and forth as he\nstudied the faces in the bunks. His stare dropped to the peanut-oil\nlamp and the lay-out tray around which reclined two smokers. He saw a\npiglike dog crouching by a screen. Behind this was the entrance to\nanother room.\n\n\u201cSuppose we go in there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to speak\nto you about, Dropper.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpit it out, here!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Fay\u2019s voice took on a metallic incisiveness. He flashed a\nwarning at the Dropper. The big man shifted his eyes uneasily, and\nfollowed Fay around the screen and into a room where two\nchintz-covered windows looked out into Harrison Street. There were a\npoker-table, a couch and many chairs in the room. The floor was\ncovered with a cheap matting.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d said Fay, still swinging his cane: \u201cI came here to see\nCharley O\u2019Mara\u2019s daughter. I want to see her quick! I can\u2019t stay\naround here. It\u2019s no place--\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, cut that kid-glove stuff. What d\u2019ye think we are--stools?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see Charley\u2019s daughter--Emily!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you done with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI aint done nothin\u2019. She lives right here.\u201d\n\nFay hung his cane on a chair, removed his hat, turned, backed against\nthe poker-table and fastened upon the Dropper a glance of white fire.\n\n\u201cTell that girl to come to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, who the hell are you orderin\u2019 around?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo! Get--that--girl!\u201d\n\nThe Dropper was in his own castle. The bunks in the den were filled\nwith the reclining forms of a number of men who would commit murder\nat his bidding. He had, safely planted, the only hundred toys of\nchoice Victoria hop in all of Chicago. One could buy most anything,\nfrom virtue to a man\u2019s soul, with opium at the current prices.\n\nHe considered the matter of Fay with a slow brain. Back in the heart\nof him there lurked a fear for a five-figure man. They did big\nthings. They were supercrooks. Their weight might be felt through\npolitical influence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hep!\u201d he said sullenly. \u201cYou want to cop the skirt from me. You\nwant to tell her about diamonds and rubies and strings of pearls--of\nswag and kale and the easy life swillin\u2019 wine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything of the kind. I\u2019ve got a message for her\nfrom her old man. He\u2019s not well,\u201d Fay added cautiously, remembering\nthat under the law the Dropper might be considered Emily\u2019s guardian.\n\n\u201cSo he aint goin\u2019 to get sprung? I heard he had a swell mouthpiece\nwho was workin\u2019 with the pollies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe appeal was denied last week. The governor turned it down--cold.\nCharley may have to serve his full term.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, if that\u2019s the straight of it-- I\u2019ll get the moll an\u2019\nlet you chin with her a bit. Remember, no fancy stuff.\u201d\n\nFay stared at the dive-keeper disgustedly. The Dropper weighed over\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds. He moved his gross form across the\nmatting, paused at the screen where the piglike dog lay, and lumbered\nout of sight. His voice rasped in a shout: \u201cEmily!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer entrance came a minute after Fay had seated himself at the\npoker-table. His hand rested on his hat. He heard the Dropper\u2019s\nnagging oaths.\n\nEmily entered, propelled by a strong arm.\n\nFay rose. He flashed an assuring glance. He reached and offered her a\nchair.\n\nThe picture she left with him, as he turned for the chair, was one he\ncould never forget.\n\nGolden-glossed hair, fine-spun as flax, an oval face, big\nsherry-colored eyes, long lashes, a round breast and straight\nfigure--was his summing up of little Emily O\u2019Mara.\n\nThe Dropper lunged for the girl. He lifted her chin. He leered as she\ncringed from him.\n\n\u201cThis guy wants to see you, kid!\u201d\n\nFay pressed the sides of his trousers with the sensitive tips of his\nfingers. He waited, with his teeth grinding. He wanted to leap the\ndistance, reach, clutch and throttle the purple neck of the brute.\n\nThe Dropper swung a terrible jaw and eyed Fay.\n\n\u201cGo to it!\u201d he rumbled. \u201cGet done with the kid, damn quick. Tell her\nshe\u2019ll never see her old man again. That\u2019s wot I\u2019ve been tellin\u2019\nher--all the time.\u201d\n\nFay waited until the Dropper disappeared. He moved the chair he had\noffered to the girl, so that she could see it.\n\n\u201cWont you sit down, Emily? I left your dad last night. He wasn\u2019t\nwell.\u201d\n\nA flash of interest and gratitude crossed her features. She clutched\nher skirt, stared at the door, bent one knee and sank into the chair\ntimidly.\n\nFay leaned and whispered:\n\n\u201cYour father sent me to you. He wants you to leave this bunch. He\u2019s\nafraid you are not being well treated. He thinks you ought to go to\nsome good home,\u201d he added as he realized the girl\u2019s underworld\nupbringing.\n\n\u201cIs Father coming back to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, never.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nThe naivete of the question struck Fay as an indictment against\nsociety.\n\n\u201cBecause the laws are unjust!\u201d he declared. \u201cThey keep a man in\nprison after he is reformed. They don\u2019t keep a man in a hospital\nafter he is cured.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you escape from Rockglen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould it make any difference to you if I had broken out of prison?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference to me--but I don\u2019t know what you\nmean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean I want you to go away with me. I want to get you out of this\nden of petty-larceny addicts and low-brows. That\u2019s what your father\nwanted, Emily.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t even know your name. Why should I run away with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the Dropper is a brute. Because he will beat you--if he\nhasn\u2019t already. Because the life here leads to the gutter--and mighty\nfast you\u2019ll drift down to it, little Emily.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl arranged a black velvet bandeau on her hair. Fay noticed\nthat the rings on her fingers were brassy and childish. They grated\non a man who had never handled any but first-water jewels.\n\nHe leaned forward and suggested:\n\n\u201cCome with me--say, to-morrow night. We\u2019ll go East together. I know a\nmotherly woman who has an old mansion on the Hudson.\u201d\n\nLittle Emily fluttered her lashes in an anxious glance at the open\ndoor, beyond which was the sound of dreamy voices.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wont let me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is he to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, but I\u2019m afraid of him. He\u2019s so strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big mush, little Emily--a woman-beater, a peddler of opium--a\nFink, if you know what that means.\u201d\n\nThe girl pulled her dress down to the tops of her broken shoes. She\ntwisted, glanced up, smiled faintly, and blanched as the Dropper\nthrust his head into the room.\n\n\u201cWhat are you tryin\u2019 to pull off?\u201d he asked.\n\nFay stared over the girl\u2019s cringing shoulder. His steel-blue eyes\nlocked with the brute\u2019s. They burned and blazed into a sodden brain.\nThe Dropper leered, said, \u201cOh, all right, cul,\u201d and went back to the\nsmokers around the lay-out tray.\n\n\u201cQuick, Emily! Make up your mind. Can I come for you to-morrow night?\nI owe it to your old man. We\u2019ll go East, and this woman I know will\ntake care of you. I hate the coppers, and I\u2019m out to collect from the\nworld. They sent me away to Rockglen--dead, bang wrong! They gave me\nlife and fifteen years. I didn\u2019t serve fifteen weeks!\u201d\n\nFay ceased pleading. He watched the girl. There was a mark behind her\nleft ear which could only have come from a blow. She fingered a black\nvelvet bandeau. She clenched her hands. She started to rise. Suddenly\nshe dropped to the chair.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go--even if Dad wants me to. I can\u2019t leave the Dropper. I am\nafraid he\u2019ll kill me if I go away with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got you cowed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you slave for him--work for him--touch his hand when he calls for\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. You don\u2019t understand my position.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an outrage. Poor Charley O\u2019Mara\u2019s daughter held in the clutches\nof that beast!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is going to kill me some day. I saw him kill a man once. He hit\nhim with his fist. They carried the man to the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose I come here to-morrow night with a gat, stick up the joint,\nmake the Dropper whine like a cur. What would you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t whine. He\u2019d kill you--the way he killed that man who\ndidn\u2019t pay him for a card of hop.\u201d\n\nFay caught the underworld note.\n\n\u201cDo you smoke?\u201d His voice was suspicious.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t smoke opium. I watch other people do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too sensible. Does the Dropper smoke?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe don\u2019t smoke, either. He sells the stuff.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 brought a smile to Fay\u2019s lips.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going East,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make the money for your\neducation. I\u2019ve got two big jobs located. One is in Maiden Lane.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiamonds?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, gems. What do you say, little Emily?\u201d\n\n\u201cI--I am afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut think what a beautiful world this is. There is London and Paris\nand Rome.\u201d\n\n\u201cLondon and Paris and Rome mean nothing to me. I wouldn\u2019t know how to\nbehave in those places. All I\u2019ve known is Harrison Street, and the\nback rooms of saloons, and getting beat up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut your dad was a high-roller.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t always. Sometimes he was broke. Sometimes we didn\u2019t know\nwhere we were going to get things to eat.\u201d\n\nFay\u2019s voice grew tender.\n\n\u201cEmily,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s all a bad dream. Yesterday afternoon I made\na get-away. A man who was dying--a mark for the prison screws--told me\nto go and save his daughter. I don\u2019t want you to think I forgot that\nrequest. I could never forget it. Charley was a pal o\u2019 mine. I came\nright to you. I see the lay-out. You\u2019re cowed, beaten, crushed, by\nthe Dropper. I\u2019ll croak him when you ask me to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t! I want you to go away. Please don\u2019t suggest anything like\nthat. I like you, but I can never run away with you. I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood God, do you want me to leave you in this joint?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only life I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do you sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a cot upstairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you ought to have a palace. Did you ever look at yourself in the\nglass?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes, after he beats me.\u201d\n\nFay started toward the door. He heard a chair upset. Little Emily\ndragged on his arm.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go to him! He\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you come with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid to.\u201d\n\nThe girl spoke the truth. Her color was ashen.\n\nFay went to the table, lifted her chair, turned it and motioned for\nher to sit down. She hesitated between the table and door.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said Fay.\n\nHe might have been addressing a princess. Her color returned in\nrippling waves. She tried to smile. Her lips trembled--she took one\nstep in his direction, swayed, and pressed her fists to her breast.\n\nThe Dropper\u2019s form completely filled the doorway.\n\n\u201cCome here!\u201d he snarled.\n\n\u201cHold on!\u201d snapped Fay.\n\n\u201cCome \u2019ere, yuh!\u201d\n\nThe girl between the two men, made her choice, or rather, had it made\nfor her.\n\nShrinkingly demure, and altogether tearful, she pressed by the\nDropper and glided across the den where the poppy-smokers lay.\n\n\u201cGo to bed!\u201d\n\nFay saw the brute\u2019s chin move in a slow circle over his shelving\nshoulder. He swung back his jaw.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re next,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter beat it, bo. I\u2019ll tame yuh like I\u2019ve\ntamed her.\u201d\n\n\u201cTamed is good.\u201d Fay picked up his hat. He hooked the cane over his\nleft sleeve. \u201cRather pleasant evening, Dropper.... I see you\nunderstand women.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess I do. Yuh want to let \u2019em know you\u2019re the biggest guy alive.\nI\u2019m that guy. Nobody ever took a broad away from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s only a kid, Dropper.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother year--\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. Well, so long. There\u2019ll be another night, too.\nI\u2019m coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be ready for yuh!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nFay had no set plan as he left the scatter of Mike Cregan--alias the\nDropper. He wanted to thrash out the matter of Emily O\u2019Mara in his\nmind. Her behavior, and the fear she held of her unsavory guardian,\npuzzled the cracksman.\n\nHe had accomplished much in a brief time. There were not many men\nliving who could have broken out of Rockglen on one afternoon and\nstrolled down Michigan Avenue the next. It was an exploit in keeping\nwith his reputation.\n\nMidnight found him working over the problem of the girl. He recalled\nold Charley\u2019s last instructions:\n\n\u201cGet her away from the low-brows.\u201d\n\nA promise, Fay had never intentionally broken. There was the\ngirl--naive, doll-like, docile. There was the Dropper--demanding,\nbrutish, a fink.\n\nFay slept that night at a stag hotel.\n\nHe woke early, bathed beneath a shower, dressed and went down to\nbreakfast.\n\nOn Harrison Street he gulped the air. He avoided being seen by the\ndetectives of the city. Once he took a cab for a distance of five\nsquares. He dismissed the driver at the side entrance of a cheap\nhotel--sauntered through the lobby and emerged with a sharp glance to\nleft and right.\n\nThe game gripped him as he dodged into the tenement and started\nclimbing the gas-flared stairways to the hop-joint. He knew, in the\nsoul of him, that Chicago was a danger-spot.\n\nHe knocked on the door and was admitted by the Dropper--who seemed\nalone.\n\n\u201cBack again,\u201d said Fay. \u201cI said I\u2019d be back. Where is Emily?\u201d\n\n\u201cWot t\u2019hell!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the girl?\u201d\n\nA gliding sounded over the matting of the room beyond the screen.\nEmily thrust her head through the doorway. Her sherry-colored eyes\nwere red-rimmed, glazed with tears, sullen. The Dropper had just\nfinished his morning hate by upbraiding her.\n\n\u201cWot t\u2019hell\u2019s comin\u2019 off?\u201d rumbled the dive-keeper. \u201cBeat it, cul,\nbefore I wake up. I\u2019m going to wham yuh one.\u201d\n\nFay swiftly hooked his cane over the edge of an empty bunk, removed\nhis hat, took off his coat, and rolled up his sleeves.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a gat!\u201d he snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t need one. Get into that\nroom, set the card-table back and pile up the chairs. Get ready, you\nfink, for what\u2019s coming to you.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Dropper found himself in the grip of a situation not exactly to\nhis liking. He backed from Fay. He crashed over the screen. He\nturned, thrust Emily aside, and shelved forward his shoulders in an\naggressive posture. His brows worked up and down. The scar on his\ncheek grew livid.\n\n\u201cHol\u2019 on,\u201d he started to protest.\n\nFay stepped swiftly forward, whipped over a lightning uppercut, and\njabbed with his left fist toward the brute\u2019s stomach. Both blows had\nforce enough to land the Dropper against the card-table.\n\nHe went down like a pole-axed bullock. He rose in his might and rage.\nHis bellowing could have been heard a block away. He came at Fay\nunskillfully--thrown off balance by the sudden attack.\n\nThe clean life of a supercrook stood Fay in good stead. His weight\nwas less than half that of the Dropper\u2019s. But he more than made up\nfor this by the swiftness of his blows. He tormented the brute by\njabs, hooks and side-stepping.\n\nThe Dropper was no novice at boxing. Once, years before, he had been\nHonest Abe\u2019s chief bouncer. He had broken men\u2019s heads and hurled\nderelicts from barrooms. He knew the rudiments of wrestling.\n\nSlowly his thick brain came into action. He covered his jaw with a\nshelving shoulder. He put down his bulletlike head and started to\nbore through the rain of blows. With wild swings he forced Fay\nagainst the poker-table. It went over and rolled to the wall near\nwhere Emily crouched.\n\nThe cracksman glided around the Dropper and shadow-tormented him. He\nstruck straight from the shoulder. He was two-fisted and agile. Each\nflash of his eye was marked by a stinging blow. A crescendo of\neffort, all to the brute\u2019s purple face, had its effect. The Dropper\nstarted gasping. He lowered his fists. He breathed, waiting. He\ngrunted as he followed Fay--blindly, grossly. A red gleam showed where\nhis lids were puffing.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nFay felt his own strength waning. He called on all his latent\nnerve-force. He became a tiger. He leaped, drove a smashing fist\nbetween the Dropper\u2019s gorilla-like brows, stepped back, dodged a\nswing, then repeated the blow. He played for this mark. The fury of\nhis assault was like an air-hammer on a rivet. It deadened the\nbrute\u2019s brain. It made him all animal.\n\nA bull\u2019s roar filled the room. Goaded to an open defense, the Dropper\nabandoned science. He tried to grasp his tormentor. His huge hands\ngroped through the air. He stumbled and searched. He fell over a\nchair. He rose to his knees. Fay waited, hooked a short, elbow-jab\nbetween the eyes. He followed with his left. His arm snapped in its\nsting. He backed, side-stepped, and started around the Dropper,\ndelivering blows like a cooper finishing a barrel.\n\nA red rage came to the cracksman that was terrible in its ferocity.\nHe forgot Emily. He saw only the swollen thing before him. He wanted\nto kill. He sought for the opening.\n\nAbandoning his straight jabs, he danced in and out with short-arm\nswings to the face and neck and eyes. He pounded the ears until they\nresembled cauliflowers. He made a pulp of the Dropper\u2019s face.\n\nThe end came in less than a second. Beaten into near-insensibility,\ntottering and bloated--the Dropper attempted to reach the door that\nled to the opium-joint. He remembered a gat he had planted there. He\nlowered his shielding left shoulder. His jaw was exposed.\n\nFay poised on tiptoes, drew back his right fist and sent it home with\nthe tendons of his legs strained in the effort. His weight, his rage,\nhis science and clean living were in that blow. It milled the brute,\nstaggered and brought him crashing, first to his knees, then over on\nhis back, where he lay with his swollen face turned toward the\nceiling.\n\nLittle Emily glided to the door. She waited with her eyes fixed and\nshimmering.\n\nFay breathed deeply. He turned, unrolled his silk sleeves and said:\n\n\u201cWill--you--get my hat and coat and cane, please?\u201d\n\nLittle Emily helped him on with his coat. Her hands trembled.\n\n\u201cNow get _your_ things. You\u2019re going away from here.\u201d\n\nShe returned within three minutes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou saw me knock him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo look at him.\u201d\n\nEmily hurried into the room. She knelt by the Dropper\u2019s head. She\ncame back to Fay and whispered:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, little Emily?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you are stronger than he is.\u201d\n\nFay opened the door that led to the hallway where the gas-flare\nshowed in the gloom.\n\n\u201cHave you everything?\u201d he asked.\n\nEmily pointed to a pasteboard hatbox. Fay lifted it gallantly.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going to take me?\u201d she asked, humbly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take you to the house of the good woman on the Hudson.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are _you_ going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? I\u2019m going to get word to Charley O\u2019Mara that I kept my\npromise--and his kid\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\n\nTHE END",
