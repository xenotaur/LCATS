    "body": "\"There's absolutely nothing we can pin it down to with any real\ncertainty,\" Kessler said. \"No mechanical defects that we're sure of,\nno sabotage we can put our finger on, no murder or suicide schemes,\nnothing! We've put that plane back together so perfectly that it could\nalmost fly again! We've got dossiers an inch thick on practically\neverybody who was aboard, crew and passengers. We've done six months'\nwork and we don't have one single positive answer. The newspapers were\nyelling about the number of insurance policies issued for the flight\nbut none of them looks really phony.\"\n\nHe stood at the huge window of Senator Brogan's office, looking out at\nthe shimmering sunlight on one of Washington's green malls. Over the\ntreetops he could catch a glimpse of the Capitol dome.\n\nBrogan sat comfortably in the big chair behind his desk. \"But weren't\nthere an unusually large number of policies issued?\" he asked. His big\nhands toyed with a little silver airplane propeller, a souvenir of his\nlong-standing interest in the problems of commercial aviation. \"You\nknow,\" he went on, leaning forward on his elbows and replacing the\npropeller neatly on the base of his fountain pen stand, \"this is a\nmatter of interest to me in more than an official sense. Eileen\nBennett was one of my wife's best friends. She was on her way to\nWashington to visit us after a stopover in New York.\"\n\nKessler nodded. \"I know that's one of the reasons you wanted to\ncompare notes.\" He stood with his back to the window now, a stocky man\nwith a jaw to match and short-cropped graying hair. \"The newspapers\nwere quite right, of course. There were an unusually large number of\ninsurance policies issued for the flight but nearly all were for the\nminimum amount.\"\n\n\"What about Pearlow?\"\n\nKessler frowned. \"Pearlow had reason to be nervous. You know he\nsurvived a crash just three years ago. But anyway, the fact remains\nthat we've looked into the backgrounds of every one of those people.\nNone of them was facing any real financial difficulties!\"\n\n\"That sounds odd in itself,\" George Brogan said, smiling slightly.\n\nKessler ran his hand over his hair and returned to sit in a leather chair\nbeside the senator's desk. He smiled in response. \"I know it sounds odd\nbut it's true. Their troubles were all run-of-the-mill--getting taxes\npaid, the mortgage, a new car, a long-overdue raise in salary--that sort\nof thing. Nothing that anybody in his right mind would kill or commit\nsuicide over.\"\n\nBrogan lifted a bushy eyebrow in question. \"Maybe you've put your\nfinger on it there?\"\n\nKessler ticked off his reply, holding up one hand. \"One former mental\npatient, pronounced cured ten years ago and apparently perfectly\nnormal; a well-established businessman; a used-car dealer; three\ncurrently under psychoanalysis; a college girl twenty-one; a housewife\nwith four children; an injured veteran just out of service. None\nshowed any violent tendencies according to their doctors.\"\n\n\"Any criminals?\"\n\nKessler regarded him wryly from beneath his eyebrows. \"Don't kid me,\nsenator. I know you've done your own investigation on this. But to\nanswer your question: Evan Prewitt's your man--only one who could\nqualify. Tried on a manslaughter charge for killing his brother-in-law\nwhile they were out hunting. He said it was an accident and the jury\nagreed. He was acquitted. True, he had one of the large insurance\npolicies, but then I'm sure you know Miss Bennett had one, too.\"\n\nThe senator nodded. \"I knew that. But I know very little of Eileen's\nfinancial situation otherwise. Not,\" he added hastily, \"that I would\nfor a moment suspect Eileen Bennett of harming a fly. She's one person\nI could rule out. It would be just like her to fall down the steps\ngetting off the plane, but as for her planning her own death or anyone\nelse's, that's out of the question. She was much too scatterbrained. I\nhope that's not speaking ill of the dead.\"\n\n\n\nKessler frowned. \"You'll forgive me, senator, in that regard, if I\nask you a question? Miss Bennett didn't drink, did she?\"\n\n\"Eileen? Heavens, no! Oh, she'd have a drink to be sociable, but it\nwas usually a sherry and half the time she wouldn't finish that. I\ndon't suppose you were envisaging the possibility that she highjacked\nthe plane from four officers and two stewardesses and then wrecked\nit?\" This time he smiled the broad toothy smile that made him a\nfavorite with Washington news photographers.\n\n\"Hardly. The thing is, I've gotten so I feel I knew every one of those\nseventy-three people personally. You know, I've interviewed almost two\nthousand friends and acquaintances of those people and I'm not quite\nfinished yet, just hoping I'll run across something that makes sense.\nI could have told you Miss Bennett's habits with a glass of sherry,\nthat's why I was a little surprised.\"\n\nSenator Brogan shook his head. \"Oh, no, I didn't mean to suggest\nanything like that. It's just that Eileen was ... well, clumsy is an\nunkind word ... unco-ordinated I guess, though she tried to make a\njoke of it. She was always bumping into things, spilling her glass of\nwater and things like that, but not because she had been drinking too\nmuch.\"\n\n\"As for drinking,\" Kessler said, \"there were quite a few real guzzlers\non the plane. I don't mean that actor, who was notorious. He'd just\nlost a part because of his drinking and he was sober for a change. But\nit's amazing what you'll turn up about respectable people when you\nstart investigating.\"\n\n\"I'm very interested in that aspect, as you may know,\" Brogan said.\n\"We periodically get bills which would outlaw drinking aboard planes.\nWhat are your ideas on that subject?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't mind a drink aboard a plane myself. Helps me relax. But\nI have seen some pretty unpleasant things develop during a flight when\nyou get a nasty drunk riled up.\"\n\n\"Did you find any suggestion of that?\"\n\n\"Not really. The plane took off from Chicago just after lunch time and\na good many of the people who got on there had had a drink or two, but\nthere wasn't really enough time to make trouble. The plane had hardly\ncleared the runway. All the passengers, except one, had their seat\nbelts fastened.\"\n\n\"Now there is something I didn't know! Who was this?\"\n\n\"Preston, a lawyer from New Jersey. You know how tentative any\nreconstruction of events must be under the circumstances, but we're\npretty sure of this, especially since there was no fire. Preston\napparently broke a fingernail trying to fasten his seat belt and one\nof the stewardesses had brought him a little first-aid kit. He had\ntorn open a Band-Aid and was trying to fasten it around his finger.\nObviously this was just before the crash.\"\n\n\"But how do you know he did it with the seat belt?\"\n\n\"Guesswork, except that it wasn't fastened and we think maybe it just\ngot overlooked after he hurt himself.\"\n\n\"Was he one of the drinkers?\"\n\n\"No, not at all. Never touched it. In point of fact, nobody was really\ndrunk at the time of the take-off. The flight engineer however had had\ntwo drinks at lunch.\"\n\nBrogan raised his eyebrows. \"You _were_ thorough. You're sure?\"\n\nKessler nodded. \"Brown was a problem drinker though it didn't seem to\ninterfere with his work. The two drinks are all he had that day so far\nas we can determine. He showed up for lunch at a girl friend's\napartment with a black eye. Made some joke about walking into a door\nand wouldn't tell her anything else about it. She gave him the drinks\nat his request, and a big lunch, and put a little makeup on his eye\nbecause he'd been pulled from a flight a few months before when he\nshowed up looking as though he'd been in a scrap.\"\n\n\"How did he really get the black eye?\"\n\n\"There you've got me. Maybe he was telling his girl friend the truth.\nHe had an estranged wife, incidentally, but she hadn't seen him for\nyears. Good riddance, she said.\"\n\nSenator Brogan picked up the propeller again and rolled it\nreflectively between his palms. He looked intently at Kessler.\n\"Nothing seems really conclusive, does it? You know some of the wild\nrumors that have been going around about this crash?\" Kessler nodded\nand started to speak. Brogan held up his hand. \"Let me finish. You\nknow and I know--or at least we think we do--that there's nothing to\nmost of these rumors. And I'm not even talking about the wilder ones,\nlike the little people from outer space who are knocking our airplanes\ndown without leaving a trace. You get three or four of these\nunexplainable accidents and somebody is sure to come up with a really\ncrackpot idea. The general public will not be convinced that this sort\nof thing can happen with no discoverable reason. Usually we have no\nway of reconstructing what happened before the accident. Just a couple\nof unintelligible remarks on the radio, as there were here, and then\neveryone is dead, the plane is totally demolished, and witnesses on\nthe ground come up with ten different hysterical accounts--if there\nare any witnesses at all!\"\n\n\"But this was a little different, after all, senator,\" Kessler\ninterjected.\n\nBrogan held up his hand again. \"Just let me have my say. You know we\nfolks down here in Washington always have a lot to say and we hate\nbeing interrupted.\" He smiled briefly. \"This sort of thing has been\ngoing on in aviation history for the last fifty years--these\nunexplained accidents--and there's nothing especially new about this\nlast one. You're shaking your head, but let me continue. One of the\nreasons they are now getting so much attention is that with the big\njets the loss of life is apt to be pretty appalling when an accident\ndoes happen, but the actual number of accidents per flight--as you\nwell know--is far fewer than it used to be and has been going down\nsteadily over the years.\"\n\nKessler, slumped deep in his chair, fingers arced together before him,\nstared morosely but said nothing. \"Secondly,\" Brogan went on, \"it is\nnot true that these accidents are happening more to American planes\nthan foreign ones. Again it is chiefly that we are scheduling more and\nmore flights. On the law of averages we are doing very well. You know\nhow many crashes the foreign carriers have chalked up in the last\nyear. And just about the same proportion are these so-called\nunexplainable crashes. It's not that they are unexplainable! It's\nsimply that we don't have the information that would explain them! The\nvery circumstances preclude that. Am I making any sense?\"\n\nKessler nodded. \"Yes, senator, I suppose you are, but it doesn't make\nme any happier. I want to find out why and stop them.\"\n\n\"So do I, I assure you. But let me finish briefly. Among the other\nwild rumors are suggestions that we are being sabotaged by foreign\nagents or by their tools. Well now, I'd be the last one in the\nworld--you know my record--to deny the possibility of some folks doing\nthis if they thought they could get away with it. If I thought for one\nmoment--or if I thought that you thought for one moment--that there\nwas some international sabotage going on here, I'd say go on with your\ninvestigation till you get the answer!\"\n\nBrogan flung himself back dramatically in his big chair, throwing out\nhis arms. \"Meanwhile, what are you accomplishing? You've spent--and I\nhappen to know this for a fact--almost a million dollars on this\ninvestigation. By your own account you have personally talked to two\nthousand people about it! You have kept this accident in the public\neye and given it far greater importance than it deserves--through no\nmalicious fault of your own, to be sure! But what have you got?\nNothing. Exactly what I came up with. Nothing. Tell me, for example,\nwhere you got with the political possibilities of this thing. I know\nyou didn't overlook it!\"\n\nKessler smiled wearily. \"Just about everything you say is true,\nGeorge. Only, you see, I would probably never have ended up running\nthis investigation if I were the sort of person that comes up with a\nquestion mark for an answer. I said 'human error' in my report, but\nthat doesn't satisfy me. I want to know what human error. I don't\nthink anything happens without a reason. Somehow I feel that it's all\nthere, the answer, in those couple of million details we've pieced\ntogether about the plane and the crew and the passengers and it's\nstaring me in the face if I could only see it.\"\n\n\"I agree with you.\" Brogan raised his hand again in his imperious\ngesture then dropped it to the desk. \"No. I asked to have my say. Now\nyou have yours.\" He sat patiently.\n\n\n\nKessler grinned. \"Thanks, senator. As for the political sabotage\npossibilities, you've undoubtedly seen a copy of my confidential\nreport. Three of the passengers had definite subversive connections in\nthe past. I know, I'm not trying to make much of this. Their\nassociations all date back to the 1930s and one of them was just a\ngirl flirting with a Communist fellow student, but we didn't want to\noverlook any possibilities. Pearlow, on the other hand, was Russian\nborn. He's the one who barely survived another airline crash three\nyears ago.\"\n\n\"Pearlow was perfectly loyal. Just an ironic coincidence, that's all.\nI know the papers tried to make something out of it but I find it hard\nto believe that you took it seriously. As for Stepowski, he testified\nopenly about his past here in Washington five years ago.\"\n\n\"I know. I even know that Stepowski's favorite television program was\n'I Led Three Lives.' I tell you there's very little I don't know about\nanybody who was aboard, with one possible exception.\"\n\nBrogan was alert. \"Who's this?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's no great mystery, senator. Robert J. Spencer, of Keokuk,\nIowa. We know quite a bit about him, actually, but it's all third\nhand. He was a retired court stenographer, seventy-three years old,\ngoing to New York for his sister's funeral at the time of the crash.\nHe boarded the plane at Chicago. He took a train to Chicago because he\ndidn't like to fly, then he got sick there, apparently from some\nmushrooms he picked at home and had for lunch before he left. He had\nto lay over in Chicago for a day and then he got on the plane at the\nlast minute so he wouldn't miss the funeral.\"\n\n\"Sounds to me as though you knew everything about him.\"\n\n\"Funny thing, though,\" said Kessler, \"I have yet to speak to a single\nperson who ever exchanged ten words with Robert J. Spencer. He lived\nalone, a complete recluse. Neighbors never saw him. Probably his\nsister would have been able to tell me something about him but she's\ndead. Actually, while I'm here in Washington I'm going to stop by and\nsee an old acquaintance of his, a Miss Valeria Schmitt. They worked\ntogether as court stenographers in Iowa City more than twenty-five\nyears ago. They were engaged but they never married. She moved here\nduring World War II and they never saw much of each other after that.\"\nHe shrugged. \"I know it's a long shot, but I don't want to miss a\nchance.\"\n\nSenator Brogan shook his head, smiling. \"I have to admire you,\nKessler. But may I express some little reservation? Do you really\nthink looking up an acquaintance of Mr. Spencer's from twenty-five\nyears ago is going to help materially in solving the mystery of a\nplane crash that occurred just last February? Or that the taxpayers\ncould be very happy at this sort of expenditure of their money?\"\n\nKessler flushed darkly and leaned forward in his chair, clasping his\nhands. \"Senator,\" he said, his voice cracking a little, \"the taxpayers\nare not spending a cent currently on this investigation. My staff has\nbeen dismissed or returned to their regular duties. I went off the\npayroll three weeks ago. My final report has been submitted. I'm doing\nthis at my own expense because I feel that I have to. I'm not\nsatisfied. There has to be an answer!\"\n\n\n\nBrogan turned the emotion away from himself with professional skill.\n\"Bob, look,\" he said, addressing Kessler by his given name for the\nfirst time during their interview, \"I'm not criticizing you personally\nfor a second. And that's not why I asked you to stop by. I asked you\nto come over and see me as a favor. You're not working for me and I\ndon't pretend to be in any position of authority as far as your\ninvestigation goes. I asked you here because I'm deeply concerned\nmyself about these accidents and I wanted to know if you could\nenlighten me in any way. May I say one personal thing though? Aren't\nyou getting emotionally involved in this?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm emotionally involved!\" Kessler burst out. \"I'm sorry,\nGeorge.\" He passed his hand over his face and went on in a lower\nvoice. \"It's just that I've been eating, breathing, sleeping, dreaming\nthis thing for the last six months. I feel as though I knew everyone\nof those seventy-three people personally. The Patterson girl, who\nlooked as though she might be going to have a little good luck for a\nchange. I even know that the pilot nicked himself shaving that\nmorning. His friends called him Mike even though his name was Edward.\nHe had a fight with his wife the night before. She wanted to eat out\nand he wanted to stay home. He was working with this crew for the\nfirst time though they all knew each other very well.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Brogan perked up. \"I suppose I knew that. Is it possibly\nsignificant?\"\n\n\"Possibly, possibly. Everything is possibly significant but nothing\nreally adds up. The routines were all standard, the four men were all\nvets. Aside from the pilot they had all worked together for years, off\nand on.\"\n\n\"Still, couldn't wires have gotten crossed as a result of some\nmisunderstanding with a new pilot aboard?\"\n\n\"Sure they could. What with the flight engineer being a souse and the\npilot new to the crew and the co-pilot just back after a two-month\nlayoff because of a ski accident. 'Human error,' that's what I said.\"\n\n\"Ski accident? I thought it was the stewardess that had the ski\naccident? I'm not going to trip you up in your own bailiwick now, am\nI?\"\n\n\"Stewardess?\" Kessler frowned. \"You must be mistaken, senator.\"\n\n\"I felt quite sure,\" Brogan said musingly.\n\n\"I know your reputation for a fact, senator,\" Kessler said\nuncomfortably, \"but a stewardess with a ski accident. Oh! Oh, yes.\nBut not recent. That was Miss Sosnak, but it was almost a year before.\nThe newspaper accounts got garbled. Both she and the other stewardess,\nMiss Prentiss, were ski enthusiasts. They were thinking about spending\nthe weekend at Stowe after they got to New York, even though they had\nboth broken ankles previously. Their friends in San Francisco were\njoking with them about it before they left. They gave Miss Sosnak a\ndoll with a cast on its leg as a gag. The doll was found in the\nwreckage. Apparently Miss Sosnak had given it to the little girl who\nwas killed on the flight, Barbara Patterson, who actually had a cast\non her leg at the time. She had fallen and hurt herself a few days\nbefore.\"\n\n\n\nA buzzer on Senator Brogan's desk hummed two short discreet hums.\nBrogan made no attempt to answer it. He stood and came around the\ndesk, putting his hand on Kessler's shoulder. \"Don't get up just yet,\"\nhe said. \"My secretary buzzes me every fifteen minutes in case I want\nto show my constituents how busy I am. If there's anyone waiting, let\nthem wait. There's just a little bit more I'd like to say.\" He sat in\nthe wide embrasure of the window and leaned forward on a crossed knee.\nHe looked the picture of negligence but he was obviously pausing to\nchoose his words with care. Kessler shifted his chair to face him.\n\n\"I won't mince words,\" Brogan said, \"because I think we understand\neach other. We always have. Thanks to your splendid investigation, and\nmy only little efforts perhaps, we know more about the circumstances\nof this crash than any other in aviation history. I had exactly your\nfeeling that the answer ought to be there. But I don't see it and you\ndon't see it. We know absolutely everything but one thing. We don't\nknow what caused it. And we're never going to know that. I really\nthink you are doing the aviation industry, yes and the country itself,\na real injury by going on. I won't say what I think you're doing to\nyourself because it will sound like a sentimental appeal and you've\nknown me too long not to know I'm pretty hard-headed.\"\n\n\"The investigation is over,\" Kessler said sullenly.\n\n\"Yes, I know, officially, but you've just told me you're going on with\nit personally.\"\n\n\"It's one last remote chance.\"\n\n\"Well, tell me this, Bob, if this last remote chance doesn't work out,\nwill you call it quits and not start in on another last remote chance?\nWill you and Margaret get on up to that place of yours in Maine and\ntake a good long vacation?\"\n\nKessler smiled wryly. \"Margaret has ideas of her own along that line.\nShe's followed through on this with me all the way but she came down\nto Washington to meet me today and she says she's going to drag me off\nwhen I'm through here.\"\n\nBrogan smiled his famous smile. \"Good girl, Margaret. If she's here\nand has a leash on you, I know I don't have anything to worry about.\nThere's nothing I admire more than a woman who has a mind and uses it.\nI'll tell you something else,\" he said, standing and permitting\nKessler to rise this time. \"I was truly sorry about Eileen Bennett's\ndeath on this plane, but Eileen was getting along like me. Sarah\nPollitt's was the really tragic case, to have accomplished so much so\nyoung and with that fearful handicap! From childhood, too, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Actually, she was about seventeen. Someone threw a firecracker in a\ncar in which she was riding, but she could see partially with one\neye.\"\n\nBrogan nodded. \"But a beautiful woman, for all that. And then to have\nachieved so much. I understand nothing about chemistry but I know her\ninternational repute. She had just become head of the chemistry\ndepartment at Wellesley, hadn't she?\"\n\n\"Radcliffe.\"\n\nBrogan laughed loudly. \"I might have known I couldn't trip you up. But\ntell me this,\" he added slyly, \"did you know that Dr. Pollitt had once\nbeen a good friend of Bergmann?\"\n\n\"Our former Commie on the plane? Yes, as a matter of fact, we came\nacross that quite accidentally. You did a good job, senator.\"\n\n\"Well, you know we have some sources not generally accessible.\"\n\n\"Then you undoubtedly found out that though Sarah Pollitt and friend\nBergmann knew each other well at one time she dropped him like a hot\ncake when he suggested she do a little undercover work for the\nCommies. Their being on the same plane was the sheerest coincidence.\"\n\nBrogan stood with his hand on the door with led to the corridor. He\nnodded. \"That was a little hard to take, wasn't it? We really thought\nwe had something there for a while.\" He sighed. \"It's like the whole\nthing, Bob, irrational and unexplainable. And believe me, I hope I\nhaven't sounded critical of the job you did. I hope we can call on you\nwhenever we need really expert advice?\"\n\n\"Of course, senator, though I don't feel much like an expert on\nanything right now.\"\n\n\"You did your best, Bob.\" He patted him on the shoulder in farewell.\n\n\n\nKessler walked down a long marble corridor to a rotunda. His wife\nwaved to him from across a staircase. She looked pert and cool and\ngirlish in her ice-blue suit and perky hat. \"Here, darling! Oh, you\nlook so discouraged! Did George give you a hard time? He can be a\nbrute when he wants to.\"\n\n\"Not really. He thinks I ought to call it quits.\"\n\n\"And don't you think so, dear?\" she asked, taking his arm as they\nstarted down the stairs.\n\n\"Who me?\" He grinned with sudden boyishness. \"You know me. Never say\ndie! If I thought we ought to give it up would I be trying to find\nthis old bag Valeria Schmitt or whatever her name is? Brogan was\nright, that's just about as farfetched a notion as has come down the\npike in a long time.\"\n\n\"Well, it may be farfetched, but she's not an old bag. I called her to\nmake sure she'd be at home. I didn't know how long you'd take in\nthere. She was very excited that you were coming to see her.\"\n\n\"Did she know who I was?\"\n\n\"Of course, even aside from the letters. She's been following the\ninvestigation very carefully. She didn't seem to think it was at all\ncurious that you wanted to see her because she knew someone\ntwenty-five years ago.\"\n\nKessler laughed as they stepped out into the hot sunlight. \"Well, if\nshe's not a bag she's a bat. The more I think about it the crazier it\nseems. Suppose we get it over with now and start for Maine tonight.\nWe'll be all set to go.\"\n\n\"Good! Good! That's the way I like to hear you talk. We'll make it a\nsecond honeymoon.\"\n\nMargaret was still musing dreamily when they finally got to the car\nand started off in the direction of Silver Spring, where Valeria\nSchmitt lived in maiden retirement. \"It will be just wonderful, dear,\"\nshe said and then sighed. \"Oh, but it reminds me of those poor\nValentes, going off on their honeymoon.\"\n\n\"Now, now. I'm the one who's supposed to be obsessed with the crash,\nnot you.\"\n\n\"Oh, but that was so sad. He was so handsome. And she was a pretty\nlittle thing, too, if you could tell from the wedding pictures. And\nthen having postponed the wedding twice, too! It seems just like some\nfate was dogging them.\"\n\nKessler chuckled. \"I don't think mumps really qualifies as an evil\nfate.\"\n\n\"No, but can you imagine! First him and then her! If it had been only\none or the other they would both be alive and happy today.\"\n\n\"Alive anyway. I talked to some of his friends who suggested he was a\nmean one even before he had mumps.\" He smiled at his wife. \"Even if he\nwas good-looking. And now will you look out for Miss Schmitt's number\nbefore I pile us up and we miss out on our second honeymoon?\"\n\n\n\nMiss Schmitt proved to look as well as sound much younger than Kessler\nknew her to be, a bright and plump little woman with very very blond\nhair tightly curled. Margaret had come along into her little apartment\nwithout much urging. Miss Schmitt had apparently been expecting both\nof them because she had three flower-painted glasses out for lemonade.\n\n\"I suppose I'm old-fashioned,\" she was saying cheerfully before they\nwere even settled, \"but I don't hold by cocktails. Nothing more\ncooling than good old lemonade. Real lemons, too, not this bottled\nstuff. You know what they say--you can take them out of the country\nbut you can't take the country out of them!\" She laughed breathlessly.\n\"I've been living in the big city for twenty-five years now but I'm\nstill an Ioway girl. Get back almost every year, too, still perfectly\nat home there. I'll be sitting out on the veranda next month drinking\nlemonade and shooing flies like I'd never been away!\" She laughed her\nbreathless laugh again.\n\nMargaret was obviously enjoying herself as much as Valeria Schmitt.\nEven Kessler was relaxed now, leaning back in the choice chair by the\nwindow with his collar pulled open. His search _had_ been a neurotic\none, he decided, as he listened to Miss Schmitt's pleasant chatter. He\nrealized he would learn nothing here, but now he was not angry even\nwith himself.\n\nMiss Schmitt had taken the first opportunity to explain that she was a\nlot younger than her old boy friend, who had died in the crash at the\nage of seventy-three. \"Of course my family were against Bob Spencer\nfor that reason, too. He was almost fifteen years older than me.\"\nKessler suppressed a smile. He knew the difference in age was more\nlike ten years, but Miss Schmitt was secure in her blond, plump good\ncheer. \"It's a little too much,\" she went on, \"fifteen years, but then\nwe never really did hit it off. Never really broke off, either.\" She\nheld up her hand, displaying a ring. \"See. Just got it out a few\nmonths ago. Haven't worn it for I don't know how many years. When I\nleft Iowa City--\"\n\n\"I thought it was Keokuk?\" Margaret interrupted. She was perfectly at\nhome with Valeria as she sipped her lemonade.\n\n\"No, honey.\" It was girl-talk now and Kessler was happy to let it go\non, feeling suddenly very tired. \"We worked together as stenographers\nin Iowa City. I was from right near there, but Bob was from Keokuk.\nThat's where he retired to. Anyway I got this job in Washington during\nthe war--World War II, that is--and I went back pretty often and saw\nBob but I was young and foolish at the time and kept putting off and\nputting off the wedding and then it just never did happen. I offered\nBob his ring back but he wouldn't hear of it. Said maybe it would\nstill work out for us. Course by this time I knew it never would.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry.\" Kessler caught the note of real sincerity in\nMargaret's voice. \"That seems too bad.\"\n\n\"Oh, why be sorry?\" Valeria asked gaily. \"I'm not. Bob was real sweet\nin his way but he was a real stick-in-the-mud even when I first met\nhim.\"\n\n\"I understand he was actually a recluse in his later years,\" Kessler\nsaid.\n\n\"Later years! Lord, he was a recluse when he was thirty-five. Worried\nabout everything. I never regret it. My friends used to say I was\nsnapping him out of it but I could never see much sign of it. Wore\ngloves all the time to protect his hands and so he wouldn't get any\ngerms. It must have been the lemonade I was making a little while\nago, Mrs. Kessler, when you called, reminded me of one time when he\nwas visiting me back in Iowa. Just like I said, we were sitting on the\nveranda drinking lemonade I do believe and swatting flies and Bob was\nlaughing and talking along with everyone else. Well, he was in a\nrocker just like this one and I gave him the fly swatter because he\nwas laughing at me and I said, 'O.K., mister, you go ahead and try to\nhit one if you're so smart.' And he gave a great big swing, laughing,\nand that rocker went right over the edge of the veranda!\" She laughed\nher breathless laugh till she had to dab at her eyes.\n\nKessler and Margaret smiled at her innocent memories. Kessler\nsuppressed a yawn. \"Oh, my,\" Margaret said, \"the poor man! How\nembarrassing if he was that shy.\"\n\nMiss Schmitt examined her lacy handkerchief in sadly smiling\nrecollection. \"I shouldn't laugh now,\" she said, \"but it was so funny.\nHe didn't think so, of course! He stomped right out of the yard\nwithout a word. I wouldn't have thought it was funny then if I'd known\nhow bad he hurt himself. He was laid up for about three weeks. I guess\nthat was the beginning of the end for us. Bob said every time he went\nout something terrible happened to him. Poor fellow. He was right at\nthat. Just a bad luck artist.\"\n\n\n\nMiss Schmitt was prepared to reminisce indefinitely. Kessler decided\nhe had better come to the point. \"I don't suppose, Miss Schmitt,\" he\nasked, \"that you and Mr. Spencer ever discussed politics?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Why, yes, I guess we did a little, being among\npoliticians in court and all. We were both good solid Republicans\nthough, so we didn't have much to say back in those days. I voted for\nRoosevelt in 1940 but Bob didn't mind.\"\n\n\"This may sound farfetched, Miss Schmitt, but to your knowledge was\nMr. Spencer ever interested in Communism?\"\n\n\"Bob?\" she asked incredulously. \"Bob interested in Communism? We\ndidn't even know what Communism was out there. Never! You can count\nthat out, mister.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we can,\" Kessler said. \"Did he drink?\"\n\n\"Not a drop! I wouldn't have put up with that myself.\"\n\n\"Would you ever have thought he was suicidally inclined?\"\n\nShe thought about this one. \"You mean he might have put a bomb on the\nplane? Like that fellow did a few years ago?\" She shook her head\nslowly. \"I can't believe Bob would kill anybody else just to kill\nhimself. What would be the point?\"\n\n\"Exactly. He left no one behind him. Didn't even take out an insurance\npolicy. But, of course, people sometimes do crazy things.\"\n\nMiss Schmitt's plump little face was silent and reflective. \"Bob was\nan odd one. And, of course, I haven't seen him for years but I got a\nChristmas card and a little note every single year and he always\nseemed perfectly sane to me. As for killing himself or anybody else,\nI'd say he was much too timid a man for that. God forgive me if I'm\nbeing cruel to an old friend who's gone now, but he was afraid to step\noutside the house. I don't know how he got to work. He was always\ngetting sick or getting hurt and staying home for weeks. I think he\nwelcomed sickness just so he could hide at home safe.\" There were\ntears of another sort in Miss Schmitt's eyes now. Kessler thought he\ndetected a brightness in his wife's eyes. \"No,\" Miss Schmitt said,\n\"Bob was afraid of life. Just plumb scared.\" She refused to let the\ntears flow. \"Oh, but I'm being a terrible hostess! I have so few\nvisitors now. How about some more lemonade?\"\n\nMargaret flicked a glance at her husband and gave him the floor.\n\"You've been a wonderful hostess,\" Kessler said, rising, \"and I want\nto thank you for being good enough to talk to us.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm afraid I haven't been much help,\" she said, rising to\nflutter over the glasses.\n\n\"That's not your fault,\" Kessler said. \"As you know, we haven't come\nup with an answer on this investigation, but at least they can't say I\ndidn't try.\"\n\n\n\nMiss Schmitt waved to them from the window of her apartment as they\ngot in their car. \"She was sweet, you know,\" Margaret murmured as she\nwaved back gaily. \"Sad about them, too.\"\n\n\"Well, investigation's over,\" Kessler smiled at Margaret as he drove\naway. \"Results, nil. Second honeymoon, anyone? We've got nothing to\nkeep us now. How do we get to the highway from here?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" Margaret murmured, still bemused by Miss Schmitt. \"But\nwasn't it a shame they never got married? He was such an unhappy man.\nShe might have brought him out of it.\"\n\n\"I doubt that,\" Kessler said, adjusting the sun blind against the\nevening glare of the sun.\n\n\"Like she said, he was a hard luck artist. It's a personality type, it\ndoesn't change.\"\n\n\"What?\" Kessler asked, maneuvering a corner in heavy traffic.\n\n\"Accident prone. You know, everything happened to him. Like those\nmushrooms he got sick on just before he left home; falling off the\nporch. No wonder he didn't want to leave home.\"\n\nThey drove in silence for some time, Kessler intent on the evening\nflood of traffic, Margaret almost drowsing in the evening sunlight and\nthe cool of the breeze in her hair. When Kessler pulled up at a drug\nstore she said, \"What?\" sleepily.\n\n\"Phone call I have to make. You wait here,\" he said. She nodded.\n\nKessler got through to Senator Brogan's office quickly. \"Hello, Miss\nPersons? I'm glad you're still there. This is Bob Kessler. Do you\nhave any idea where the senator is now? Good, would you put me through\nto him?\"\n\nBrogan sounded anything but sleepy. \"Yes Bob? Finally wind it up?\"\n\n\"I think maybe I have,\" Kessler said. \"I've seen Miss Schmitt.\"\n\n\"Ah, Spencer's old flame? And what did you learn?\"\n\nWhen Kessler was finished telling him there was a long pause. \"Are you\nstill there, George?\" he asked.\n\nBrogan's voice was heavy. \"Yes, Bob, I'm still here. Where are you\ncalling from? A public phone? Well, I think maybe you'd better come up\nhere. We have more to say than you have dimes and it won't hurt to\nkeep this to ourselves if we can--or till we're sure. Better bring\nyour complete files. Good. One point, though! Did anything I said this\nafternoon help? I wondered. I couldn't really believe it myself. If\nyou'd said something, I wouldn't have felt I was going crazy. I've\nbeen sitting here wondering if I should see a head doctor.\"\n\nMargaret smiled philosophically when Kessler told her he had to go\nback to see Brogan. \"Some second honeymoon,\" she complained. \"Well,\nanyway, what about that drink and a steak dinner. I'll get us a hotel\nroom. Maybe tomorrow, like I always say.\"\n\n\n\nIt was nearly ten o'clock when Kessler and Brogan met Margaret at the\nhotel dining room. \"It's about time!\" she declared. \"I'm starving.\nHello there, George. What are you doing to my husband? Or vice versa?\nWe were going to go on a second honeymoon and now he has that\nfiend-for-work look in his eye!\"\n\n\"My dear Margaret,\" Brogan said, holding her hand and smiling\ngallantly, \"I must deeply apologize for keeping Bob. And I'm almost\nfrightened to say that it looks as though it will be for some time\nlonger. We will have to go back after dinner and it may be some days\nbefore either of us has much free time.\"\n\nMargaret looked at them suspiciously, with the brightness in her eye\nthat came from her first martini. \"What are you two up to now? Some of\nthis top secret stuff? I might know! I can't get away from it! Never\nmind, I'll worm it out of Bob when I get him alone. If that ever\nhappens!\"\n\nThey carefully avoided any further reference to the investigation\nuntil they were halfway through dinner in the nearly deserted dining\nroom. Margaret, mellowed by a second martini and all of her steak\nwhich she ate, sighed. \"Poor Miss Schmitt,\" she said. \"I've been\nfeeling sorry for her all evening when I haven't been feeling sorry\nfor myself.\"\n\n\"Why Miss Schmitt?\" Kessler asked, chewing.\n\n\"Oh, I shouldn't, I know. Bob Spencer would probably have been a worse\nhusband than you are. But at least I'm glad I went along with you to\nvisit her. I settled something that's been bothering me.\"\n\n\"What was that, dear?\" Kessler asked, raising a juicy morsel of steak\nto his lips.\n\n\"Why, that he was accident prone.\"\n\nKessler lowered his fork. \"Yes, you mentioned that before,\" he said\ncarefully. \"I was telling George about it. But why did you think he\nmight be?\"\n\nMargaret looked at their startled faces. She fluttered her hands.\n\"Well, everyone else on the plane was.\"\n\nThe three of them stared at each other. \"Did I say something wrong?\"\nshe asked nervously. \"Well, they were, you know! The stewardesses both\nhad broken their legs. And the flight engineer got a black eye walking\ninto a door. You remember, Bob, you couldn't be sure how it happened,\nbut that must have been it. Even the pilot had cut himself shaving.\nThat very morning!\"\n\nKessler and Brogan had stopped eating and were watching her intently.\n\"Stop staring,\" she said indignantly. \"You're making me nervous.\nWhat's wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing, dear,\" Kessler said quietly. \"It's very interesting. Go on.\"\n\nShe looked at him suspiciously. \"Well, when it comes to the\npassengers! What do you mean? You know all this!\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Brogan said.\n\n\"Well, one man was even in another plane crash before. I forget his\nname.\"\n\n\"Pearlow,\" Kessler murmured.\n\n\"Pearlow, yes. And Dr. Pollitt who was blinded in an accident. I don't\nreally know about your friend Miss Bennett, senator.\"\n\nBrogan nodded. \"She qualifies.\"\n\n\"And the little girl, Barbara? Who had the automobile accident? The\nveteran? Prewitt, who accidentally killed his brother? At least two of\nthose people were going to psychiatrists. Well, Mr. Spencer had me\nworried because I didn't know if the mushrooms qualified him as\naccident prone. Then, of course, when I found out about him definitely\nI figured the Valentes qualified, too, with the mumps. The man who\nbroke his fingernail! Oh, just about everybody I think.\"\n\nKessler and Brogan glanced at each other. Brogan nodded. \"Just about\neverybody,\" he said. \"And all on the same plane. It's something that\nwould happen once in ten thousand times. Like being dealt a solid suit\nin bridge. But it can happen. It seems to have happened this time. And\nI think maybe it's happened before. Maybe one person who was not\naccident prone could make the difference. But when I think about a\nplane taking off with those particular seventy-three people aboard it\nreally scares me.\"\n\nMargaret looked from Brogan to Kessler, confused. Kessler put his hand\nover hers on the table cloth and gripped it tightly. \"Darling,\" he\nsaid, \"when we have finished our coffee, George and I are going back\nto his office and I think maybe you'd better come along with us. We\nhave a lot of thinking to do, the three of us, and we could use a\nfeminine touch.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
