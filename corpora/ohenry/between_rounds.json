    "body": "\nThe May moon shone bright upon the private boarding-house of Mrs. Murphy. By\nreference to the almanac a large amount of territory will be discovered upon\nwhich its rays also fell. Spring was in its heydey, with hay fever soon to\nfollow. The parks were green with new leaves and buyers for the Western and\nSouthern trade. Flowers and summer-resort agents were blowing; the air and\nanswers to Lawson were growing milder; hand-organs, fountains and pinochle were\nplaying everywhere.\n\n\nThe windows of Mrs. Murphy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boarding-house were open. A group of\nboarders were seated on the high stoop upon round, flat mats like German\npancakes.\n\n\nIn one of the second-floor front windows Mrs. McCaskey awaited her husband.\nSupper was cooling on the table. Its heat went into Mrs. McCaskey.\n\n\nAt nine Mr. McCaskey came. He carried his coat on his arm and his pipe in his\nteeth; and he apologised for disturbing the boarders on the steps as he\nselected spots of stone between them on which to set his size 9, width Ds.\n\n\nAs he opened the door of his room he received a surprise. Instead of the usual\nstove-lid or potato-masher for him to dodge, came only words.\n\n\nMr. McCaskey reckoned that the benign May moon had softened the breast of his\nspouse.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d came the oral substitutes for kitchenware. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe\ncan apollygise to riff-raff of the streets for settin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 yer unhandy feet\non the tails of their frocks, but ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099d walk on the neck of yer wife the\nlength of a clothes-line without so much as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Kiss me fut,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that long from rubberin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 out the windy for ye\nand the victuals cold such as there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s money to buy after drinkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nup yer wages at Gallegher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s every Saturday evenin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and the gas man\nhere twice to-day for his.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWoman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. McCaskey, dashing his coat and hat upon a chair,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe noise of ye is an insult to me appetite. When ye run down politeness\nye take the mortar from between the bricks of the foundations of society.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis no more than exercisin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the acrimony of a gentleman when ye\nask the dissent of ladies blockin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the way for steppin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 between\nthem. Will ye bring the pig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face of ye out of the windy and see to the\nfood?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMrs. McCaskey arose heavily and went to the stove. There was something in her\nmanner that warned Mr. McCaskey. When the corners of her mouth went down\nsuddenly like a barometer it usually foretold a fall of crockery and tinware.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. McCaskey, and hurled a stewpan\nfull of bacon and turnips at her lord.\n\n\nMr. McCaskey was no novice at repartee. He knew what should follow the\nentr\u00c3\u00a9e. On the table was a roast sirloin of pork, garnished with\nshamrocks. He retorted with this, and drew the appropriate return of a bread\npudding in an earthen dish. A hunk of Swiss cheese accurately thrown by her\nhusband struck Mrs. McCaskey below one eye. When she replied with a well-aimed\ncoffee-pot full of a hot, black, semi-fragrant liquid the battle, according to\ncourses, should have ended.\n\n\nBut Mr. McCaskey was no 50-cent table d\u00e2\u0080\u0099h\u00c3\u00b4ter. Let cheap\nBohemians consider coffee the end, if they would. Let them make that faux\npas. He was foxier still. Finger-bowls were not beyond the compass of his\nexperience. They were not to be had in the Pension Murphy; but their equivalent\nwas at hand. Triumphantly he sent the granite-ware wash basin at the head of\nhis matrimonial adversary. Mrs. McCaskey dodged in time. She reached for a\nflatiron, with which, as a sort of cordial, she hoped to bring the\ngastronomical duel to a close. But a loud, wailing scream downstairs caused\nboth her and Mr. McCaskey to pause in a sort of involuntary armistice.\n\n\nOn the sidewalk at the corner of the house Policeman Cleary was standing with\none ear upturned, listening to the crash of household utensils.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis Jawn McCaskey and his missis at it again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meditated\nthe policeman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder shall I go up and stop the row. I will not.\nMarried folks they are; and few pleasures they have. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twill not last\nlong. Sure, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to borrow more dishes to keep it up with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAnd just then came the loud scream below-stairs, betokening fear or dire\nextremity. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis probably the cat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Policeman Cleary,\nand walked hastily in the other direction.\n\n\nThe boarders on the steps were fluttered. Mr. Toomey, an insurance solicitor by\nbirth and an investigator by profession, went inside to analyse the scream. He\nreturned with the news that Mrs. Murphy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little boy, Mike, was lost.\nFollowing the messenger, out bounced Mrs. Murphy\u00e2\u0080\u0094two hundred pounds in\ntears and hysterics, clutching the air and howling to the sky for the loss of\nthirty pounds of freckles and mischief. Bathos, truly; but Mr. Toomey sat down\nat the side of Miss Purdy, millinery, and their hands came together in\nsympathy. The two old maids, Misses Walsh, who complained every day about the\nnoise in the halls, inquired immediately if anybody had looked behind the\nclock.\n\n\nMajor Grigg, who sat by his fat wife on the top step, arose and buttoned his\ncoat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe little one lost?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will scour the\ncity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His wife never allowed him out after dark. But now she said:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo, Ludovic!\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a baritone voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhoever can look upon\nthat mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grief without springing to her relief has a heart of\nstone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me some thirty or\u00e2\u0080\u0094sixty cents, my love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid the Major. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLost children sometimes stray far. I may need\ncarfares.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nOld man Denny, hall room, fourth floor back, who sat on the lowest step, trying\nto read a paper by the street lamp, turned over a page to follow up the article\nabout the carpenters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 strike. Mrs. Murphy shrieked to the moon:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, ar-r-Mike, f\u00e2\u0080\u0099r Gawd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, where is me little bit av a\nboy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ye see him last?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked old man Denny, with one eye\non the report of the Building Trades League.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wailed Mrs. Murphy, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas yisterday, or maybe\nfour hours ago! I dunno. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lost he is, me little boy Mike. He was\nplayin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on the sidewalk only this mornin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094or was it\nWednesday? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m that busy with work, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis hard to keep up with\ndates. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve looked the house over from top to cellar, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngone he is. Oh, for the love av Hiven\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nSilent, grim, colossal, the big city has ever stood against its revilers. They\ncall it hard as iron; they say that no pulse of pity beats in its bosom; they\ncompare its streets with lonely forests and deserts of lava. But beneath the\nhard crust of the lobster is found a delectable and luscious food. Perhaps a\ndifferent simile would have been wiser. Still, nobody should take offence. We\nwould call no one a lobster without good and sufficient claws.\n\n\nNo calamity so touches the common heart of humanity as does the straying of a\nlittle child. Their feet are so uncertain and feeble; the ways are so steep and\nstrange.\n\n\nMajor Griggs hurried down to the corner, and up the avenue into Billy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nplace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGimme a rye-high,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to the servitor.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen a bow-legged, dirty-faced little devil of a\nsix-year-old lost kid around here anywhere, have you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMr. Toomey retained Miss Purdy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand on the steps. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThink of that\ndear little babe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Purdy, \u00e2\u0080\u009clost from his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nside\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps already fallen beneath the iron hoofs of galloping\nsteeds\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it dreadful?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAin\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d agreed Mr. Toomey, squeezing her hand.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay I start out and help look for um!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Purdy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou should. But, oh, Mr. Toomey,\nyou are so dashing\u00e2\u0080\u0094so reckless\u00e2\u0080\u0094suppose in your enthusiasm some\naccident should befall you, then what\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nOld man Denny read on about the arbitration agreement, with one finger on the\nlines.\n\n\nIn the second floor front Mr. and Mrs. McCaskey came to the window to recover\ntheir second wind. Mr. McCaskey was scooping turnips out of his vest with a\ncrooked forefinger, and his lady was wiping an eye that the salt of the roast\npork had not benefited. They heard the outcry below, and thrust their heads out\nof the window.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis little Mike is lost,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. McCaskey, in a hushed\nvoice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe beautiful, little, trouble-making angel of a gossoon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bit of a boy mislaid?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. McCaskey, leaning out of the\nwindow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, now, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad enough, entirely. The childer, they\nbe different. If \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas a woman I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be willin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, for they leave\npeace behind \u00e2\u0080\u0099em when they go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nDisregarding the thrust, Mrs. McCaskey caught her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJawn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, sentimentally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMissis Murphy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlittle bye is lost. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a great city for losing little boys. Six years\nold he was. Jawn, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the same age our little bye would have been if we\nhad had one six years ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe never did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. McCaskey, lingering with the fact.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if we had, Jawn, think what sorrow would be in our hearts this\nnight, with our little Phelan run away and stolen in the city nowheres at\nall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe talk foolishness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. McCaskey. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis Pat he\nwould be named, after me old father in Cantrim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe lie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. McCaskey, without anger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMe brother was\nworth tin dozen bog-trotting McCaskeys. After him would the bye be\nnamed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She leaned over the window-sill and looked down at the hurrying\nand bustle below.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJawn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. McCaskey, softly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry I was\nhasty wid ye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas hasty puddin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, as ye say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her husband,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand hurry-up turnips and get-a-move-on-ye coffee. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas what ye\ncould call a quick lunch, all right, and tell no lie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMrs. McCaskey slipped her arm inside her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and took his rough\nhand in hers.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen at the cryin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of poor Mrs. Murphy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis an awful thing for a bit of a bye to be lost in this great\nbig city. If \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas our little Phelan, Jawn, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be breakin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nme heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAwkwardly Mr. McCaskey withdrew his hand. But he laid it around the nearing\nshoulder of his wife.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis foolishness, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, roughly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be cut up some meself if our little Pat was kidnapped or anything.\nBut there never was any childer for us. Sometimes I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been ugly and hard\nwith ye, Judy. Forget it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThey leaned together, and looked down at the heart-drama being acted below.\n\n\nLong they sat thus. People surged along the sidewalk, crowding, questioning,\nfilling the air with rumours, and inconsequent surmises. Mrs. Murphy ploughed\nback and forth in their midst, like a soft mountain down which plunged an\naudible cataract of tears. Couriers came and went.\n\n\nLoud voices and a renewed uproar were raised in front of the boarding-house.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up now, Judy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mr. McCaskey.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis Missis Murphy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. McCaskey,\nharking. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe says she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s after finding little Mike asleep behind\nthe roll of old linoleum under the bed in her room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMr. McCaskey laughed loudly.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yer Phelan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted, sardonically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDivil a\nbit would a Pat have done that trick. If the bye we never had is strayed and\nstole, by the powers, call him Phelan, and see him hide out under the bed like\na mangy pup.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMrs. McCaskey arose heavily, and went toward the dish closet, with the corners\nof her mouth drawn down.\n\n\nPoliceman Cleary came back around the corner as the crowd dispersed. Surprised,\nhe upturned an ear toward the McCaskey apartment, where the crash of irons and\nchinaware and the ring of hurled kitchen utensils seemed as loud as before.\nPoliceman Cleary took out his timepiece.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the deported snakes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJawn McCaskey and\nhis lady have been fightin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for an hour and a quarter by the watch. The\nmissis could give him forty pounds weight. Strength to his arm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nPoliceman Cleary strolled back around the corner.\n\n\nOld man Denny folded his paper and hurried up the steps just as Mrs. Murphy was\nabout to lock the door for the night.\n",
