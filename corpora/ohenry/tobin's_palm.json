    "name": "OHenry - Tobin\u2019s Palm",
    "body": "\nTobin and me, the two of us, went down to Coney one day, for there was four\ndollars between us, and Tobin had need of distractions. For there was Katie\nMahorner, his sweetheart, of County Sligo, lost since she started for America\nthree months before with two hundred dollars, her own savings, and one hundred\ndollars from the sale of Tobin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inherited estate, a fine cottage and pig\non the Bog Shannaugh. And since the letter that Tobin got saying that she had\nstarted to come to him not a bit of news had he heard or seen of Katie\nMahorner. Tobin advertised in the papers, but nothing could be found of the\ncolleen.\n\n\nSo, to Coney me and Tobin went, thinking that a turn at the chutes and the\nsmell of the popcorn might raise the heart in his bosom. But Tobin was a\nhardheaded man, and the sadness stuck in his skin. He ground his teeth at the\ncrying balloons; he cursed the moving pictures; and, though he would drink\nwhenever asked, he scorned Punch and Judy, and was for licking the tintype men\nas they came.\n\n\nSo I gets him down a side way on a board walk where the attractions were some\nless violent. At a little six by eight stall Tobin halts, with a more human\nlook in his eye.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be diverted. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nhave the palm of me hand investigated by the wonderful palmist of the Nile, and\nsee if what is to be will be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nTobin was a believer in signs and the unnatural in nature. He possessed illegal\nconvictions in his mind along the subjects of black cats, lucky numbers, and\nthe weather predictions in the papers.\n\n\nWe went into the enchanted chicken coop, which was fixed mysterious with red\ncloth and pictures of hands with lines crossing \u00e2\u0080\u0099em like a railroad\ncentre. The sign over the door says it is Madame Zozo the Egyptian Palmist.\nThere was a fat woman inside in a red jumper with pothooks and beasties\nembroidered upon it. Tobin gives her ten cents and extends one of his hands.\nShe lifts Tobin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, which is own brother to the hoof of a drayhorse,\nand examines it to see whether \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a stone in the frog or a cast shoe he\nhas come for.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says this Madame Zozo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe line of your fate\nshows\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis not me foot at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tobin, interrupting.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis no beauty, but ye hold the palm of me hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe line shows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the Madame, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve not\narrived at your time of life without bad luck. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more to come.\nThe mount of Venus\u00e2\u0080\u0094or is that a stone bruise?\u00e2\u0080\u0094shows that\nye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in love. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been trouble in your life on account of\nyour sweetheart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis Katie Mahorner she has references with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispers Tobin\nto me in a loud voice to one side.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the palmist, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca great deal of sorrow and\ntribulation with one whom ye cannot forget. I see the lines of designation\npoint to the letter K and the letter M in her name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhist!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tobin to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo ye hear that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d goes on the palmist, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor a dark man and a light\nwoman; for they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll both bring ye trouble. Ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make a voyage upon\nthe water very soon, and have a financial loss. I see one line that brings good\nluck. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a man coming into your life who will fetch ye good fortune.\nYe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know him when ye see him by his crooked nose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs his name set down?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asks Tobin. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twill be\nconvenient in the way of greeting when he backs up to dump off the good\nluck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the palmist, thoughtful looking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis not\nspelled out by the lines, but they indicate \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a long one, and the\nletter \u00e2\u0080\u0098o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 should be in it. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no more to tell.\nGood-evening. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t block up the door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis wonderful how she knows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tobin as we walk to the\npier.\n\n\nAs we squeezed through the gates a nigger man sticks his lighted segar against\nTobin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear, and there is trouble. Tobin hammers his neck, and the women\nsqueal, and by presence of mind I drag the little man out of the way before the\npolice comes. Tobin is always in an ugly mood when enjoying himself.\n\n\nOn the boat going back, when the man calls \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho wants the good-looking\nwaiter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tobin tried to plead guilty, feeling the desire to blow the foam\noff a crock of suds, but when he felt in his pocket he found himself discharged\nfor lack of evidence. Somebody had disturbed his change during the commotion.\nSo we sat, dry, upon the stools, listening to the Dagoes fiddling on deck. If\nanything, Tobin was lower in spirits and less congenial with his misfortunes\nthan when we started.\n\n\nOn a seat against the railing was a young woman dressed suitable for red\nautomobiles, with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum. In passing by,\nTobin kicks her foot without intentions, and, being polite to ladies when in\ndrink, he tries to give his hat a twist while apologising. But he knocks it\noff, and the wind carries it overboard.\n\n\nTobin came back and sat down, and I began to look out for him, for the\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adversities were becoming frequent. He was apt, when pushed so\nclose by hard luck, to kick the best dressed man he could see, and try to take\ncommand of the boat.\n\n\nPresently Tobin grabs my arm and says, excited: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJawn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdo ye know what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking a voyage upon the\nwater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I; \u00e2\u0080\u009csubdue yeself. The boat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll land\nin ten minutes more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat the light lady upon the bench. And have\nye forgotten the nigger man that burned me ear? And isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the money I had\ngone\u00e2\u0080\u0094a dollar sixty-five it was?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nI thought he was no more than summing up his catastrophes so as to get violent\nwith good excuse, as men will do, and I tried to make him understand such\nthings was trifles.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tobin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve no ear for the gift of\nprophecy or the miracles of the inspired. What did the palmist lady tell ye out\nof me hand? \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis coming true before your eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Look out,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsays she, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for a dark man and a light woman; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring ye\ntrouble.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Have ye forgot the nigger man, though he got some of it back\nfrom me fist? Can ye show me a lighter woman than the blonde lady that was the\ncause of me hat falling in the water? And where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the dollar sixty-five I\nhad in me vest when we left the shooting gallery?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe way Tobin put it, it did seem to corroborate the art of prediction, though\nit looked to me that these accidents could happen to any one at Coney without\nthe implication of palmistry.\n\n\nTobin got up and walked around on deck, looking close at the passengers out of\nhis little red eyes. I asked him the interpretation of his movements. Ye never\nknow what Tobin has in his mind until he begins to carry it out.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe should know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m working out the\nsalvation promised by the lines in me palm. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking for the\ncrooked-nose man that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to bring the good luck. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis all that will\nsave us. Jawn, did ye ever see a straighter-nosed gang of hellions in the days\nof your life?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas the nine-thirty boat, and we landed and walked up-town through\nTwenty-second Street, Tobin being without his hat.\n\n\nOn a street corner, standing under a gas-light and looking over the elevated\nroad at the moon, was a man. A long man he was, dressed decent, with a segar\nbetween his teeth, and I saw that his nose made two twists from bridge to end,\nlike the wriggle of a snake. Tobin saw it at the same time, and I heard him\nbreathe hard like a horse when you take the saddle off. He went straight up to\nthe man, and I went with him.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night to ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tobin says to the man. The man takes out his\nsegar and passes the compliments, sociable.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould ye hand us your name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asks Tobin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let us look at\nthe size of it? It may be our duty to become acquainted with ye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the man, polite, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis\nFriedenhausman\u00e2\u0080\u0094Maximus G. Friedenhausman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the right length,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tobin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you spell it\nwith an \u00e2\u0080\u0098o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 anywhere down the stretch of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the man.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan ye spell it with an \u00e2\u0080\u0098o\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\u00e2\u0080\u009d inquires Tobin,\nturning anxious.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf your conscience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the man with the nose, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis\nindisposed toward foreign idioms ye might, to please yourself, smuggle the\nletter into the penultimate syllable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tobin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the presence\nof Jawn Malone and Daniel Tobin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTis highly appreciated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the man, with a bow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now\nsince I cannot conceive that ye would hold a spelling bee upon the street\ncorner, will ye name some reasonable excuse for being at large?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the two signs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answers Tobin, trying to explain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich\nye display according to the reading of the Egyptian palmist from the sole of me\nhand, ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been nominated to offset with good luck the lines of trouble\nleading to the nigger man and the blonde lady with her feet crossed in the\nboat, besides the financial loss of a dollar sixty-five, all so far fulfilled\naccording to Hoyle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe man stopped smoking and looked at me.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave ye any amendments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto offer to that\nstatement, or are ye one too? I thought by the looks of ye ye might have him in\ncharge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcept that as one horseshoe\nresembles another so are ye the picture of good luck as predicted by the hand\nof me friend. If not, then the lines of Danny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand may have been\ncrossed, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two of ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the man with the nose, looking up\nand down for the sight of a policeman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve enjoyed your company\nimmense. Good-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nWith that he shoves his segar in his mouth and moves across the street,\nstepping fast. But Tobin sticks close to one side of him and me at the other.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, stopping on the opposite sidewalk and pushing back\nhis hat; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo ye follow me? I tell ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, very loud,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud to have met ye. But it is my desire to be rid of ye. I\nam off to me home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tobin, leaning against his sleeve. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo be off to\nyour home. And I will sit at the door of it till ye come out in the morning.\nFor the dependence is upon ye to obviate the curse of the nigger man and the\nblonde lady and the financial loss of the one-sixty-five.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a strange hallucination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the man, turning to me\nas a more reasonable lunatic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ye better get him\nhome?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDaniel Tobin is as sensible as\nhe ever was. Maybe he is a bit deranged on account of having drink enough to\ndisturb but not enough to settle his wits, but he is no more than following out\nthe legitimate path of his superstitions and predicaments, which I will explain\nto you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With that I relates the facts about the palmist lady and how the\nfinger of suspicion points to him as an instrument of good fortune. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\nunderstand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I concludes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy position in this riot. I am the\nfriend of me friend Tobin, according to me interpretations. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis easy to\nbe a friend to the prosperous, for it pays; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis not hard to be a friend\nto the poor, for ye get puffed up by gratitude and have your picture printed\nstanding in front of a tenement with a scuttle of coal and an orphan in each\nhand. But it strains the art of friendship to be true friend to a born fool.\nAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor, in my\nopinion, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no fortune to be read from the palm of me hand that\nwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t printed there with the handle of a pick. And, though ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\ngot the crookedest nose in New York City, I misdoubt that all the\nfortune-tellers doing business could milk good luck from ye. But the lines of\nDanny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand pointed to ye fair, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll assist him to experiment\nwith ye until he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convinced ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAfter that the man turns, sudden, to laughing. He leans against a corner and\nlaughs considerable. Then he claps me and Tobin on the backs of us and takes us\nby an arm apiece.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis my mistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow could I be expecting\nanything so fine and wonderful to be turning the corner upon me? I came near\nbeing found unworthy. Hard by,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a caf\u00c3\u00a9, snug and\nsuitable for the entertainment of idiosyncrasies. Let us go there and have\ndrink while we discuss the unavailability of the categorical.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nSo saying, he marched me and Tobin to the back room of a saloon, and ordered\nthe drinks, and laid the money on the table. He looks at me and Tobin like\nbrothers of his, and we have the segars.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe must know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the man of destiny, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat me walk in\nlife is one that is called the literary. I wander abroad be night seeking\nidiosyncrasies in the masses and truth in the heavens above. When ye came upon\nme I was in contemplation of the elevated road in conjunction with the chief\nluminary of night. The rapid transit is poetry and art: the moon but a tedious,\ndry body, moving by rote. But these are private opinions, for, in the business\nof literature, the conditions are reversed. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis me hope to be writing a\nbook to explain the strange things I have discovered in life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe will put me in a book,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tobin, disgusted; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill ye\nput me in a book?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the man, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the covers will not hold ye.\nNot yet. The best I can do is to enjoy ye meself, for the time is not ripe for\ndestroying the limitations of print. Ye would look fantastic in type. All alone\nby meself must I drink this cup of joy. But, I thank ye, boys; I am truly\ngrateful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe talk of ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tobin, blowing through his moustache and\npounding the table with his fist, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis an eyesore to me patience. There\nwas good luck promised out of the crook of your nose, but ye bear fruit like\nthe bang of a drum. Ye resemble, with your noise of books, the wind blowing\nthrough a crack. Sure, now, I would be thinking the palm of me hand lied but\nfor the coming true of the nigger man and the blonde lady and\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhist!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the long man; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould ye be led astray by\nphysiognomy? Me nose will do what it can within bounds. Let us have these\nglasses filled again, for \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis good to keep idiosyncrasies well\nmoistened, they being subject to deterioration in a dry moral\natmosphere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nSo, the man of literature makes good, to my notion, for he pays, cheerful, for\neverything, the capital of me and Tobin being exhausted by prediction. But\nTobin is sore, and drinks quiet, with the red showing in his eye.\n\n\nBy and by we moved out, for \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and stands a bit\nupon the sidewalk. And then the man says he must be going home, and invites me\nand Tobin to walk that way. We arrives on a side street two blocks away where\nthere is a stretch of brick houses with high stoops and iron fences. The man\nstops at one of them and looks up at the top windows which he finds dark.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis me humble dwelling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I begin to\nperceive by the signs that me wife has retired to slumber. Therefore I will\nventure a bit in the way of hospitality. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis me wish that ye enter the\nbasement room, where we dine, and partake of a reasonable refreshment. There\nwill be some fine cold fowl and cheese and a bottle or two of ale. Ye will be\nwelcome to enter and eat, for I am indebted to ye for diversions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe appetite and conscience of me and Tobin was congenial to the proposition,\nthough \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas sticking hard in Danny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s superstitions to think that a\nfew drinks and a cold lunch should represent the good fortune promised by the\npalm of his hand.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStep down the steps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the man with the crooked nose,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will enter by the door above and let ye in. I will ask the new\ngirl we have in the kitchen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto make ye a pot of coffee\nto drink before ye go. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis fine coffee Katie Mahorner makes for a green\ngirl just landed three months. Step in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the man, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll send her down to ye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n",
