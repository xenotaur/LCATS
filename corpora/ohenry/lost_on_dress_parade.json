    "body": "\nMr. Towers Chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom. One iron\nwas heating on a small gas stove; the other was being pushed vigorously back\nand forth to make the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in\nstraight lines from Mr. Chandler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patent leather shoes to the edge of\nhis low-cut vest. So much of the hero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toilet may be intrusted to our\nconfidence. The remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel poverty has\ndriven to ignoble expedient. Our next view of him shall be as he descends the\nsteps of his lodging-house immaculately and correctly clothed; calm, assured,\nhandsome\u00e2\u0080\u0094in appearance the typical New York young clubman setting out,\nslightly bored, to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening.\n\n\nChandler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honorarium was $18 per week. He was employed in the office of\nan architect. He was twenty-two years old; he considered architecture to be\ntruly an art; and he honestly believed\u00e2\u0080\u0094though he would not have dared to\nadmit it in New York\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the Flatiron Building was inferior in design to\nthe great cathedral in Milan.\n\n\nOut of each week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings Chandler set aside $1. At the end of each ten\nweeks with the extra capital thus accumulated, he purchased one\ngentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old Father Time.\nHe arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents; he took\nhimself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest, and there dined\nwith taste and luxury. With ten dollars a man may, for a few hours, play the\nwealthy idler to perfection. The sum is ample for a well-considered meal, a\nbottle bearing a respectable label, commensurate tips, a smoke, cab fare and\nthe ordinary etceteras.\n\n\nThis one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to Chandler a\nsource of renascent bliss. To the society bud comes but one d\u00c3\u00a9but; it\nstands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened; but to Chandler\neach ten weeks brought a joy as keen, as thrilling, as new as the first had\nbeen. To sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of concealed\nmusic, to look upon the habitu\u00c3\u00a9s of such a paradise and to be\nlooked upon by them\u00e2\u0080\u0094what is a girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first dance and short-sleeved\ntulle compared with this?\n\n\nUp Broadway Chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade. For this evening\nhe was an exhibit as well as a gazer. For the next sixty-nine evenings he would\nbe dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious table d\u00e2\u0080\u0099h\u00c3\u00b4tes,\nat whirlwind lunch counters, on sandwiches and beer in his hall-bedroom. He was\nwilling to do that, for he was a true son of the great city of razzle-dazzle,\nand to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones.\n\n\nChandler protracted his walk until the Forties began to intersect the great and\nglittering primrose way, for the evening was yet young, and when one is of the\nbeau monde only one day in seventy, one loves to protract the pleasure.\nEyes bright, sinister, curious, admiring, provocative, alluring were bent upon\nhim, for his garb and air proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and\npleasure.\n\n\nAt a certain corner he came to a standstill, proposing to himself the question\nof turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in which he usually\ndined on the evenings of his especial luxury. Just then a girl scuddled lightly\naround the corner, slipped on a patch of icy snow and fell plump upon the\nsidewalk.\n\n\nChandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy. The\ngirl hobbled to the wall of the building, leaned against it, and thanked him\ndemurely.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think my ankle is strained,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt twisted when I\nfell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes it pain you much?\u00e2\u0080\u009d inquired Chandler.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly when I rest my weight upon it. I think I will be able to walk in a\nminute or two.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I can be of any further service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested the young man,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will call a cab, or\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl, softly but heartily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure\nyou need not trouble yourself any further. It was so awkward of me. And my shoe\nheels are horridly common-sense; I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame them at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nChandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest. She was\npretty in a refined way; and her eye was both merry and kind. She was\ninexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a sort of uniform\nsuch as shop girls wear. Her glossy dark-brown hair showed its coils beneath a\ncheap hat of black straw whose only ornament was a velvet ribbon and bow. She\ncould have posed as a model for the self-respecting working girl of the best\ntype.\n\n\nA sudden idea came into the head of the young architect. He would ask this girl\nto dine with him. Here was the element that his splendid but solitary periodic\nfeasts had lacked. His brief season of elegant luxury would be doubly enjoyable\nif he could add to it a lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s society. This girl was a lady, he was\nsure\u00e2\u0080\u0094her manner and speech settled that. And in spite of her extremely\nplain attire he felt that he would be pleased to sit at table with her.\n\n\nThese thoughts passed swiftly through his mind, and he decided to ask her. It\nwas a breach of etiquette, of course, but oftentimes wage-earning girls waived\nformalities in matters of this kind. They were generally shrewd judges of men;\nand thought better of their own judgment than they did of useless conventions.\nHis ten dollars, discreetly expended, would enable the two to dine very well\nindeed. The dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the\ndull routine of the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life; and her lively appreciation of it would\nadd to his own triumph and pleasure.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her, with frank gravity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat your\nfoot needs a longer rest than you suppose. Now, I am going to suggest a way in\nwhich you can give it that and at the same time do me a favour. I was on my way\nto dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the corner. You\ncome with me and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant talk together,\nand by that time your game ankle will carry you home very nicely, I am\nsure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe girl looked quickly up into Chandler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear, pleasant countenance.\nHer eyes twinkled once very brightly, and then she smiled ingenuously.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know each other\u00e2\u0080\u0094it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be right,\nwould it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, doubtfully.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing wrong about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man, candidly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll introduce myself\u00e2\u0080\u0094permit me\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mr. Towers Chandler.\nAfter our dinner, which I will try to make as pleasant as possible, I will bid\nyou good-evening, or attend you safely to your door, whichever you\nprefer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, dear me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl, with a glance at Chandler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfaultless attire. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this old dress and hat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chandler, cheerfully. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure\nyou look more charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate\ndinner toilette.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy ankle does hurt yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d admitted the girl, attempting a limping\nstep. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I will accept your invitation, Mr. Chandler. You may call\nme\u00e2\u0080\u0094Miss Marian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome then, Miss Marian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young architect, gaily, but with\nperfect courtesy; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will not have far to walk. There is a very\nrespectable and good restaurant in the next block. You will have to lean on my\narm\u00e2\u0080\u0094so\u00e2\u0080\u0094and walk slowly. It is lonely dining all by one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nself. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nWhen the two were established at a well-appointed table, with a promising\nwaiter hovering in attendance, Chandler began to experience the real joy that\nhis regular outing always brought to him.\n\n\nThe restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down\nBroadway, which he always preferred, but it was nearly so. The tables were well\nfilled with prosperous-looking diners, there was a good orchestra, playing\nsoftly enough to make conversation a possible pleasure, and the cuisine and\nservice were beyond criticism. His companion, even in her cheap hat and dress,\nheld herself with an air that added distinction to the natural beauty of her\nface and figure. And it is certain that she looked at Chandler, with his\nanimated but self-possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes, with\nsomething not far from admiration in her own charming face.\n\n\nThen it was that the Madness of Manhattan, the frenzy of Fuss and Feathers, the\nBacillus of Brag, the Provincial Plague of Pose seized upon Towers Chandler. He\nwas on Broadway, surrounded by pomp and style, and there were eyes to look at\nhim. On the stage of that comedy he had assumed to play the one-night part of a\nbutterfly of fashion and an idler of means and taste. He was dressed for the\npart, and all his good angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it.\n\n\nSo he began to prate to Miss Marian of clubs, of teas, of golf and riding and\nkennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints of a yacht lying at\nLarchmont. He could see that she was vastly impressed by this vague talk, so he\nendorsed his pose by random insinuations concerning great wealth, and mentioned\nfamiliarly a few names that are handled reverently by the proletariat. It was\nChandler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s short little day, and he was wringing from it the best that\ncould be had, as he saw it. And yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this\ngirl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and all\nobjects.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis way of living that you speak of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009csounds so\nfutile and purposeless. Haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you any work to do in the world that\nmight interest you more?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Miss Marian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cwork! Think of\ndressing every day for dinner, of making half a dozen calls in an\nafternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto\nand take you to the station, if you get up any greater speed than a donkey\ncart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gait. We do-nothings are the hardest workers in the land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe dinner was concluded, the waiter generously fed, and the two walked out to\nthe corner where they had met. Miss Marian walked very well now; her limp was\nscarcely noticeable.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you for a nice time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, frankly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must run\nhome now. I liked the dinner very much, Mr. Chandler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nHe shook hands with her, smiling cordially, and said something about a game of\nbridge at his club. He watched her for a moment, walking rather rapidly\neastward, and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward.\n\n\nIn his chilly bedroom Chandler laid away his evening clothes for a sixty-nine\ndays\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rest. He went about it thoughtfully.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was a stunning girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall right, too, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be sworn, even if she does have to work. Perhaps if\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d told her the truth instead of all that razzle-dazzle we\nmight\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, confound it! I had to play up to my clothes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the tribe of the\nManhattans.\n\n\nThe girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until she\narrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east, facing on\nthat avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary gods. Here she\nentered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a handsome young lady in an\nelaborate house dress was looking anxiously out the window.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you madcap!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen will you quit frightening us this way? It is two hours since you\nran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hat. Mamma has been so\nalarmed. She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you. You are a bad,\nthoughtless Puss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scold, sister. I only ran down to Mme. Theo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to tell\nher to use mauve insertion instead of pink. My costume and Marie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hat\nwere just what I needed. Every one thought I was a shopgirl, I am sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDinner is over, dear; you stayed so late.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know. I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle. I could not walk,\nso I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better. That is why I\nwas so long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the stream\nof hurrying vehicles in the avenue. The younger one cuddled down with her head\nin her sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lap.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will have to marry some day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said\ndreamily\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cboth of us. We have so much money that we will not be\nallowed to disappoint the public. Do you want me to tell you the kind of a man\nI could love, Sis?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on, you scatterbrain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d smiled the other.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes, who is gentle and\nrespectful to poor girls, who is handsome and good and does not try to flirt.\nBut I could love him only if he had an ambition, an object, some work to do in\nthe world. I would not care how poor he was if I could help him build his way\nup. But, sister dear, the kind of man we always meet\u00e2\u0080\u0094the man who lives an\nidle life between society and his clubs\u00e2\u0080\u0094I could not love a man like that,\neven if his eyes were blue and he were ever so kind to poor girls whom he met\nin the street.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n",
