  "name": "OHenry - From the Cabby’s Seat",
  "body": "\nThe cabby has his point of view. It is more single-minded, perhaps, than that\nof a follower of any other calling. From the high, swaying seat of his hansom\nhe looks upon his fellow-men as nomadic particles, of no account except when\npossessed of migratory desires. He is Jehu, and you are goods in transit. Be\nyou President or vagabond, to cabby you are only a Fare, he takes you up,\ncracks his whip, joggles your vertebrae and sets you down.\n\n\nWhen time for payment arrives, if you exhibit a familiarity with legal rates\nyou come to know what contempt is; if you find that you have left your\npocketbook behind you are made to realise the mildness of Danteâs\nimagination.\n\n\nIt is not an extravagant theory that the cabbyâs singleness of purpose\nand concentrated view of life are the results of the hansomâs peculiar\nconstruction. The cock-of-the-roost sits aloft like Jupiter on an unsharable\nseat, holding your fate between two thongs of inconstant leather. Helpless,\nridiculous, confined, bobbing like a toy mandarin, you sit like a rat in a\ntrapâyou, before whom butlers cringe on solid landâand must squeak\nupward through a slit in your peripatetic sarcophagus to make your feeble\nwishes known.\n\n\nThen, in a cab, you are not even an occupant; you are contents. You are a cargo\nat sea, and the âcherub that sits up aloftâ has Davy Jonesâs\nstreet and number by heart.\n\n\nOne night there were sounds of revelry in the big brick tenement-house next\ndoor but one to McGaryâs Family CafÃ©. The sounds seemed to emanate from\nthe apartments of the Walsh family. The sidewalk was obstructed by an\nassortment of interested neighbours, who opened a lane from time to time for a\nhurrying messenger bearing from McGaryâs goods pertinent to festivity and\ndiversion. The sidewalk contingent was engaged in comment and discussion from\nwhich it made no effort to eliminate the news that Norah Walsh was being\nmarried.\n\n\nIn the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merry-makers to the\nsidewalk. The uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them, and upon the night\nair rose joyous cries, congratulations, laughter and unclassified noises born\nof McGaryâs oblations to the hymeneal scene.\n\n\nClose to the curb stood Jerry OâDonovanâs cab. Night-hawk was Jerry\ncalled; but no more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its doors\nupon point lace and November violets. And Jerryâs horse! I am within\nbounds when I tell you that he was stuffed with oats until one of those old\nladies who leave their dishes unwashed at home and go about having expressmen\narrested, would have smiledâyes, smiledâto have seen him.\n\n\nAmong the shifting, sonorous, pulsing crowd glimpses could be had of\nJerryâs high hat, battered by the winds and rains of many years; of his\nnose like a carrot, battered by the frolicsome, athletic progeny of\nmillionaires and by contumacious fares; of his brass-buttoned green coat,\nadmired in the vicinity of McGaryâs. It was plain that Jerry had usurped\nthe functions of his cab, and was carrying a âload.â Indeed, the\nfigure may be extended and he be likened to a bread-waggon if we admit the\ntestimony of a youthful spectator, who was heard to remark âJerry has got\na bun.â\n\n\nFrom somewhere among the throng in the street or else out of the thin stream of\npedestrians a young woman tripped and stood by the cab. The professional\nhawkâs eye of Jerry caught the movement. He made a lurch for the cab,\noverturning three or four onlookers and himselfâno! he caught the cap of\na water-plug and kept his feet. Like a sailor shinning up the ratlins during a\nsquall Jerry mounted to his professional seat. Once he was there McGaryâs\nliquids were baffled. He seesawed on the mizzenmast of his craft as safe as a\nSteeple Jack rigged to the flagpole of a skyscraper.\n\n\nâStep in, lady,â said Jerry, gathering his lines. The young woman\nstepped into the cab; the doors shut with a bang; Jerryâs whip cracked in\nthe air; the crowd in the gutter scattered, and the fine hansom dashed away\nâcrosstown.\n\n\nWhen the oat-spry horse had hedged a little his first spurt of speed Jerry\nbroke the lid of his cab and called down through the aperture in the voice of a\ncracked megaphone, trying to please:\n\n\nâWhere, now, will ye be drivinâ to?â\n\n\nâAnywhere you please,â came up the answer, musical and contented.\n\n\nââTis drivinâ for pleasure she is,â thought Jerry. And\nthen he suggested as a matter of course:\n\n\nâTake a thrip around in the park, lady. âTwill be ilegant cool and\nfine.â\n\n\nâJust as you like,â answered the fare, pleasantly.\n\n\nThe cab headed for Fifth avenue and sped up that perfect street. Jerry bounced\nand swayed in his seat. The potent fluids of McGary were disquieted and they\nsent new fumes to his head. He sang an ancient song of Killisnook and\nbrandished his whip like a baton.\n\n\nInside the cab the fare sat up straight on the cushions, looking to right and\nleft at the lights and houses. Even in the shadowed hansom her eyes shone like\nstars at twilight.\n\n\nWhen they reached Fifty-ninth street Jerryâs head was bobbing and his\nreins were slack. But his horse turned in through the park gate and began the\nold familiar nocturnal round. And then the fare leaned back, entranced, and\nbreathed deep the clean, wholesome odours of grass and leaf and bloom. And the\nwise beast in the shafts, knowing his ground, struck into his by-the-hour gait\nand kept to the right of the road.\n\n\nHabit also struggled successfully against Jerryâs increasing torpor. He\nraised the hatch of his storm-tossed vessel and made the inquiry that cabbies\ndo make in the park.\n\n\nâLike shtop at the Cas-sino, lady? Gezzer râfreshmâs,\nân lishân the music. Evâbody shtops.â\n\n\nâI think that would be nice,â said the fare.\n\n\nThey reined up with a plunge at the Casino entrance. The cab doors flew open.\nThe fare stepped directly upon the floor. At once she was caught in a web of\nravishing music and dazzled by a panorama of lights and colours. Some one\nslipped a little square card into her hand on which was printed a\nnumberâ34. She looked around and saw her cab twenty yards away already\nlining up in its place among the waiting mass of carriages, cabs and motor\ncars. And then a man who seemed to be all shirt-front danced backward before\nher; and next she was seated at a little table by a railing over which climbed\na jessamine vine.\n\n\nThere seemed to be a wordless invitation to purchase; she consulted a\ncollection of small coins in a thin purse, and received from them license to\norder a glass of beer. There she sat, inhaling and absorbing it allâthe\nnew-coloured, new-shaped life in a fairy palace in an enchanted wood.\n\n\nAt fifty tables sat princes and queens clad in all the silks and gems of the\nworld. And now and then one of them would look curiously at Jerryâs fare.\nThey saw a plain figure dressed in a pink silk of the kind that is tempered by\nthe word âfoulard,â and a plain face that wore a look of love of\nlife that the queens envied.\n\n\nTwice the long hands of the clocks went round, Royalties thinned from their\nal fresco thrones, and buzzed or clattered away in their vehicles of\nstate. The music retired into cases of wood and bags of leather and baize.\nWaiters removed cloths pointedly near the plain figure sitting almost alone.\n\n\nJerryâs fare rose, and held out her numbered card simply:\n\n\nâIs there anything coming on the ticket?â she asked.\n\n\nA waiter told her it was her cab check, and that she should give it to the man\nat the entrance. This man took it, and called the number. Only three hansoms\nstood in line. The driver of one of them went and routed out Jerry asleep in\nhis cab. He swore deeply, climbed to the captainâs bridge and steered his\ncraft to the pier. His fare entered, and the cab whirled into the cool\nfastnesses of the park along the shortest homeward cuts.\n\n\nAt the gate a glimmer of reason in the form of sudden suspicion seized upon\nJerryâs beclouded mind. One or two things occurred to him. He stopped his\nhorse, raised the trap and dropped his phonographic voice, like a lead plummet,\nthrough the aperture:\n\n\nâI want to see four dollars before goinâ any further on thâ\nthrip. Have ye got thâ dough?â\n\n\nâFour dollars!â laughed the fare, softly, âdear me, no.\nIâve only got a few pennies and a dime or two.â\n\n\nJerry shut down the trap and slashed his oat-fed horse. The clatter of hoofs\nstrangled but could not drown the sound of his profanity. He shouted choking\nand gurgling curses at the starry heavens; he cut viciously with his whip at\npassing vehicles; he scattered fierce and ever-changing oaths and imprecations\nalong the streets, so that a late truck driver, crawling homeward, heard and\nwas abashed. But he knew his recourse, and made for it at a gallop.\n\n\nAt the house with the green lights beside the steps he pulled up. He flung wide\nthe cab doors and tumbled heavily to the ground.\n\n\nâCome on, you,â he said, roughly.\n\n\nHis fare came forth with the Casino dreamy smile still on her plain face. Jerry\ntook her by the arm and led her into the police station. A gray-moustached\nsergeant looked keenly across the desk. He and the cabby were no strangers.\n\n\nâSargeant,â began Jerry in his old raucous, martyred, thunderous\ntones of complaint. âIâve got a fare here thatââ\n\n\nJerry paused. He drew a knotted, red hand across his brow. The fog set up by\nMcGary was beginning to clear away.\n\n\nâA fare, sargeant,â he continued, with a grin, âthat I want\nto inthroduce to ye. Itâs me wife that I married at ould man\nWalshâs this avening. And a divil of a time we had, âtis thrue.\nShake hands wid thâ sargeant, Norah, and weâll be off to\nhome.â\n\n\nBefore stepping into the cab Norah sighed profoundly.\n\n\nâIâve had such a nice time, Jerry,â said she.\n",
