    "body": "\nIt was a day in March.\n\n\nNever, never begin a story this way when you write one. No opening could\npossibly be worse. It is unimaginative, flat, dry and likely to consist of mere\nwind. But in this instance it is allowable. For the following paragraph, which\nshould have inaugurated the narrative, is too wildly extravagant and\npreposterous to be flaunted in the face of the reader without preparation.\n\n\nSarah was crying over her bill of fare.\n\n\nThink of a New York girl shedding tears on the menu card!\n\n\nTo account for this you will be allowed to guess that the lobsters were all\nout, or that she had sworn ice-cream off during Lent, or that she had ordered\nonions, or that she had just come from a Hackett matinee. And then, all these\ntheories being wrong, you will please let the story proceed.\n\n\nThe gentleman who announced that the world was an oyster which he with his\nsword would open made a larger hit than he deserved. It is not difficult to\nopen an oyster with a sword. But did you ever notice any one try to open the\nterrestrial bivalve with a typewriter? Like to wait for a dozen raw opened that\nway?\n\n\nSarah had managed to pry apart the shells with her unhandy weapon far enough to\nnibble a wee bit at the cold and clammy world within. She knew no more\nshorthand than if she had been a graduate in stenography just let slip upon the\nworld by a business college. So, not being able to stenog, she could not enter\nthat bright galaxy of office talent. She was a free-lance typewriter and\ncanvassed for odd jobs of copying.\n\n\nThe most brilliant and crowning feat of Sarah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battle with the world was\nthe deal she made with Schulenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Home Restaurant. The restaurant was\nnext door to the old red brick in which she hall-roomed. One evening after\ndining at Schulenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 40-cent, five-course table\nd\u00e2\u0080\u0099h\u00c3\u00b4te (served as fast as you throw the five baseballs at the\ncoloured gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head) Sarah took away with her the bill of fare. It\nwas written in an almost unreadable script neither English nor German, and so\narranged that if you were not careful you began with a toothpick and rice\npudding and ended with soup and the day of the week.\n\n\nThe next day Sarah showed Schulenberg a neat card on which the menu was\nbeautifully typewritten with the viands temptingly marshalled under their right\nand proper heads from \u00e2\u0080\u009chors d\u00e2\u0080\u0099oeuvre\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot\nresponsible for overcoats and umbrellas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nSchulenberg became a naturalised citizen on the spot. Before Sarah left him she\nhad him willingly committed to an agreement. She was to furnish typewritten\nbills of fare for the twenty-one tables in the restaurant\u00e2\u0080\u0094a new bill for\neach day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dinner, and new ones for breakfast and lunch as often as\nchanges occurred in the food or as neatness required.\n\n\nIn return for this Schulenberg was to send three meals per diem to\nSarah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hall room by a waiter\u00e2\u0080\u0094an obsequious one if\npossible\u00e2\u0080\u0094and furnish her each afternoon with a pencil draft of what Fate\nhad in store for Schulenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers on the morrow.\n\n\nMutual satisfaction resulted from the agreement. Schulenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patrons\nnow knew what the food they ate was called even if its nature sometimes puzzled\nthem. And Sarah had food during a cold, dull winter, which was the main thing\nwith her.\n\n\nAnd then the almanac lied, and said that spring had come. Spring comes when it\ncomes. The frozen snows of January still lay like adamant in the crosstown\nstreets. The hand-organs still played \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the Good Old Summertime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwith their December vivacity and expression. Men began to make thirty-day notes\nto buy Easter dresses. Janitors shut off steam. And when these things happen\none may know that the city is still in the clutches of winter.\n\n\nOne afternoon Sarah shivered in her elegant hall bedroom; \u00e2\u0080\u009chouse heated;\nscrupulously clean; conveniences; seen to be appreciated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She had no\nwork to do except Schulenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s menu cards. Sarah sat in her squeaky\nwillow rocker, and looked out the window. The calendar on the wall kept crying\nto her: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpringtime is here, Sarah\u00e2\u0080\u0094springtime is here, I tell you.\nLook at me, Sarah, my figures show it. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a neat figure yourself,\nSarah\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\u00e2\u0080\u0094nice springtime figure\u00e2\u0080\u0094why do you look out the window\nso sadly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nSarah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room was at the back of the house. Looking out the window she\ncould see the windowless rear brick wall of the box factory on the next street.\nBut the wall was clearest crystal; and Sarah was looking down a grassy lane\nshaded with cherry trees and elms and bordered with raspberry bushes and\nCherokee roses.\n\n\nSpring\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real harbingers are too subtle for the eye and ear. Some must\nhave the flowering crocus, the wood-starring dogwood, the voice of\nbluebird\u00e2\u0080\u0094even so gross a reminder as the farewell handshake of the\nretiring buckwheat and oyster before they can welcome the Lady in Green to\ntheir dull bosoms. But to old earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choicest kin there come straight,\nsweet messages from his newest bride, telling them they shall be no\nstepchildren unless they choose to be.\n\n\nOn the previous summer Sarah had gone into the country and loved a farmer.\n\n\n(In writing your story never hark back thus. It is bad art, and cripples\ninterest. Let it march, march.)\n\n\nSarah stayed two weeks at Sunnybrook Farm. There she learned to love old Farmer\nFranklin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Walter. Farmers have been loved and wedded and turned out\nto grass in less time. But young Walter Franklin was a modern agriculturist. He\nhad a telephone in his cow house, and he could figure up exactly what effect\nnext year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canada wheat crop would have on potatoes planted in the dark\nof the moon.\n\n\nIt was in this shaded and raspberried lane that Walter had wooed and won her.\nAnd together they had sat and woven a crown of dandelions for her hair. He had\nimmoderately praised the effect of the yellow blossoms against her brown\ntresses; and she had left the chaplet there, and walked back to the house\nswinging her straw sailor in her hands.\n\n\nThey were to marry in the spring\u00e2\u0080\u0094at the very first signs of spring,\nWalter said. And Sarah came back to the city to pound her typewriter.\n\n\nA knock at the door dispelled Sarah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visions of that happy day. A waiter\nhad brought the rough pencil draft of the Home Restaurant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next day fare\nin old Schulenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s angular hand.\n\n\nSarah sat down to her typewriter and slipped a card between the rollers. She\nwas a nimble worker. Generally in an hour and a half the twenty-one menu cards\nwere written and ready.\n\n\nTo-day there were more changes on the bill of fare than usual. The soups were\nlighter; pork was eliminated from the entr\u00c3\u00a9es, figuring only with\nRussian turnips among the roasts. The gracious spirit of spring pervaded the\nentire menu. Lamb, that lately capered on the greening hillsides, was becoming\nexploited with the sauce that commemorated its gambols. The song of the oyster,\nthough not silenced, was dimuendo con amore. The frying-pan seemed to be\nheld, inactive, behind the beneficent bars of the broiler. The pie list\nswelled; the richer puddings had vanished; the sausage, with his drapery\nwrapped about him, barely lingered in a pleasant thanatopsis with the\nbuckwheats and the sweet but doomed maple.\n\n\nSarah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fingers danced like midges above a summer stream. Down through\nthe courses she worked, giving each item its position according to its length\nwith an accurate eye. Just above the desserts came the list of vegetables.\nCarrots and peas, asparagus on toast, the perennial tomatoes and corn and\nsuccotash, lima beans, cabbage\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\nSarah was crying over her bill of fare. Tears from the depths of some divine\ndespair rose in her heart and gathered to her eyes. Down went her head on the\nlittle typewriter stand; and the keyboard rattled a dry accompaniment to her\nmoist sobs.\n\n\nFor she had received no letter from Walter in two weeks, and the next item on\nthe bill of fare was dandelions\u00e2\u0080\u0094dandelions with some kind of\negg\u00e2\u0080\u0094but bother the egg!\u00e2\u0080\u0094dandelions, with whose golden blooms Walter\nhad crowned her his queen of love and future bride\u00e2\u0080\u0094dandelions, the\nharbingers of spring, her sorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crown of sorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0094reminder of her\nhappiest days.\n\n\nMadam, I dare you to smile until you suffer this test: Let the Marechal Niel\nroses that Percy brought you on the night you gave him your heart be served as\na salad with French dressing before your eyes at a Schulenberg table\nd\u00e2\u0080\u0099h\u00c3\u00b4te. Had Juliet so seen her love tokens dishonoured the\nsooner would she have sought the lethean herbs of the good apothecary.\n\n\nBut what a witch is Spring! Into the great cold city of stone and iron a\nmessage had to be sent. There was none to convey it but the little hardy\ncourier of the fields with his rough green coat and modest air. He is a true\nsoldier of fortune, this dent-de-lion\u00e2\u0080\u0094this lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tooth, as\nthe French chefs call him. Flowered, he will assist at love-making, wreathed in\nmy lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nut-brown hair; young and callow and unblossomed, he goes into\nthe boiling pot and delivers the word of his sovereign mistress.\n\n\nBy and by Sarah forced back her tears. The cards must be written. But, still in\na faint, golden glow from her dandeleonine dream, she fingered the typewriter\nkeys absently for a little while, with her mind and heart in the meadow lane\nwith her young farmer. But soon she came swiftly back to the rock-bound lanes\nof Manhattan, and the typewriter began to rattle and jump like a\nstrike-breaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motor car.\n\n\nAt 6 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock the waiter brought her dinner and carried away the\ntypewritten bill of fare. When Sarah ate she set aside, with a sigh, the dish\nof dandelions with its crowning ovarious accompaniment. As this dark mass had\nbeen transformed from a bright and love-indorsed flower to be an ignominious\nvegetable, so had her summer hopes wilted and perished. Love may, as\nShakespeare said, feed on itself: but Sarah could not bring herself to eat the\ndandelions that had graced, as ornaments, the first spiritual banquet of her\nheart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true affection.\n\n\nAt 7:30 the couple in the next room began to quarrel: the man in the room above\nsought for A on his flute; the gas went a little lower; three coal wagons\nstarted to unload\u00e2\u0080\u0094the only sound of which the phonograph is jealous; cats\non the back fences slowly retreated toward Mukden. By these signs Sarah knew\nthat it was time for her to read. She got out \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Cloister and the\nHearth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the best non-selling book of the month, settled her feet on her\ntrunk, and began to wander with Gerard.\n\n\nThe front door bell rang. The landlady answered it. Sarah left Gerard and Denys\ntreed by a bear and listened. Oh, yes; you would, just as she did!\n\n\nAnd then a strong voice was heard in the hall below, and Sarah jumped for her\ndoor, leaving the book on the floor and the first round easily the\nbear\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. You have guessed it. She reached the top of the stairs just as\nher farmer came up, three at a jump, and reaped and garnered her, with nothing\nleft for the gleaners.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you written\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Sarah.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNew York is a pretty large town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Walter Franklin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncame in a week ago to your old address. I found that you went away on a\nThursday. That consoled some; it eliminated the possible Friday bad luck. But\nit didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent my hunting for you with police and otherwise ever\nsince!\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wrote!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sarah, vehemently.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever got it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen how did you find me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe young farmer smiled a springtime smile.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dropped into that Home Restaurant next door this evening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care who knows it; I like a dish of some kind of\ngreens at this time of the year. I ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill\nof fare looking for something in that line. When I got below cabbage I turned\nmy chair over and hollered for the proprietor. He told me where you\nlived.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sighed Sarah, happily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was dandelions\nbelow cabbage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d know that cranky capital W way above the line that your\ntypewriter makes anywhere in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Franklin.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no W in dandelions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sarah, in surprise.\n\n\nThe young man drew the bill of fare from his pocket, and pointed to a line.\n\n\nSarah recognised the first card she had typewritten that afternoon. There was\nstill the rayed splotch in the upper right-hand corner where a tear had fallen.\nBut over the spot where one should have read the name of the meadow plant, the\nclinging memory of their golden blossoms had allowed her fingers to strike\nstrange keys.\n\n\nBetween the red cabbage and the stuffed green peppers was the item:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDEAREST WALTER, WITH HARD-BOILED EGG.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n",
