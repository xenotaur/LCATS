    "body": "\nIf you do not know Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chop House and Family Restaurant it is your\nloss. For if you are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you should\nbe interested to know how the other half consumes provisions. And if you belong\nto the half to whom waiters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 checks are things of moment, you should know\nBogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, for there you get your money\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth\u00e2\u0080\u0094in quantity, at\nleast.\n\n\nBogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is situated in that highway of bourgeoisie, that boulevard\nof Brown-Jones-and-Robinson, Eighth Avenue. There are two rows of tables in the\nroom, six in each row. On each table is a caster-stand, containing cruets of\ncondiments and seasons. From the pepper cruet you may shake a cloud of\nsomething tasteless and melancholy, like volcanic dust. From the salt cruet you\nmay expect nothing. Though a man should extract a sanguinary stream from the\npallid turnip, yet will his prowess be balked when he comes to wrest salt from\nBogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cruets. Also upon each table stands the counterfeit of that\nbenign sauce made \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom the recipe of a nobleman in India.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAt the cashier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desk sits Bogle, cold, sordid, slow, smouldering, and\ntakes your money. Behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change, files\nyour check, and ejects at you, like a toad, a word about the weather. Beyond a\ncorroboration of his meteorological statement you would better not venture. You\nare not Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend; you are a fed, transient customer, and you and he\nmay not meet again until the blowing of Gabriel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dinner horn. So take\nyour change and go\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the devil if you like. There you have Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsentiments.\n\n\nThe needs of Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers were supplied by two waitresses and a\nVoice. One of the waitresses was named Aileen. She was tall, beautiful, lively,\ngracious and learned in persiflage. Her other name? There was no more necessity\nfor another name at Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s than there was for finger-bowls.\n\n\nThe name of the other waitress was Tildy. Why do you suggest Matilda? Please\nlisten this time\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tildy\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tildy. Tildy was dumpy, plain-faced, and too\nanxious to please to please. Repeat the last clause to yourself once or twice,\nand make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite.\n\n\nThe Voice at Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was invisible. It came from the kitchen, and did not\nshine in the way of originality. It was a heathen Voice, and contented itself\nwith vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the waitresses concerning\nfood.\n\n\nWill it tire you to be told again that Aileen was beautiful? Had she donned a\nfew hundred dollars\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of clothes and joined the Easter parade, and\nhad you seen her, you would have hastened to say so yourself.\n\n\nThe customers at Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s were her slaves. Six tables full she could wait\nupon at once. They who were in a hurry restrained their impatience for the joy\nof merely gazing upon her swiftly moving, graceful figure. They who had\nfinished eating ate more that they might continue in the light of her smiles.\nEvery man there\u00e2\u0080\u0094and they were mostly men\u00e2\u0080\u0094tried to make his\nimpression upon her.\n\n\nAileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once. And every\nsmile that she sent forth lodged, like pellets from a scatter-gun, in as many\nhearts. And all this while she would be performing astounding feats with orders\nof pork and beans, pot roasts, ham-and, sausage-and-the-wheats, and any\nquantity of things on the iron and in the pan and straight up and on the side.\nWith all this feasting and flirting and merry exchange of wit Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncame mighty near being a salon, with Aileen for its Madame R\u00c3\u00a9camier.\n\n\nIf the transients were entranced by the fascinating Aileen, the regulars were\nher adorers. There was much rivalry among many of the steady customers. Aileen\ncould have had an engagement every evening. At least twice a week some one took\nher to a theatre or to a dance. One stout gentleman whom she and Tildy had\nprivately christened \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Hog\u00e2\u0080\u009d presented her with a turquoise ring.\nAnother one known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cFreshy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d who rode on the Traction\nCompany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repair wagon, was going to give her a poodle as soon as his\nbrother got the hauling contract in the Ninth. And the man who always ate\nspareribs and spinach and said he was a stock broker asked her to go to\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cParsifal\u00e2\u0080\u009d with him.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where this place is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aileen while talking\nit over with Tildy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the wedding-ring\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to be on before I\nput a stitch into a travelling dress\u00e2\u0080\u0094ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that right? Well, I\nguess!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nBut, Tildy!\n\n\nIn steaming, chattering, cabbage-scented Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there was almost a heart\ntragedy. Tildy with the blunt nose, the hay-coloured hair, the freckled skin,\nthe bag-o\u00e2\u0080\u0099-meal figure, had never had an admirer. Not a man followed her\nwith his eyes when she went to and fro in the restaurant save now and then when\nthey glared with the beast-hunger for food. None of them bantered her gaily to\ncoquettish interchanges of wit. None of them loudly \u00e2\u0080\u009cjollied\u00e2\u0080\u009d her\nof mornings as they did Aileen, accusing her, when the eggs were slow in\ncoming, of late hours in the company of envied swains. No one had ever given\nher a turquoise ring or invited her upon a voyage to mysterious, distant\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cParsifal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nTildy was a good waitress, and the men tolerated her. They who sat at her\ntables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of fare; and then\nraised their voices in honeyed and otherwise-flavoured accents, eloquently\naddressed to the fair Aileen. They writhed in their chairs to gaze around and\nover the impending form of Tildy, that Aileen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pulchritude might season\nand make ambrosia of their bacon and eggs.\n\n\nAnd Tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if Aileen could receive the\nflattery and the homage. The blunt nose was loyal to the short Grecian. She was\nAileen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend; and she was glad to see her rule hearts and wean the\nattention of men from smoking pot-pie and lemon meringue. But deep below our\nfreckles and hay-coloured hair the unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a\nprincess, not vicarious, but coming to us alone.\n\n\nThere was a morning when Aileen tripped in to work with a slightly bruised eye;\nand Tildy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solicitude was almost enough to heal any optic.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFresh guy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Aileen, \u00e2\u0080\u009clast night as I was going\nhome at Twenty-third and Sixth. Sashayed up, so he did, and made a break. I\nturned him down, cold, and he made a sneak; but followed me down to Eighteenth,\nand tried his hot air again. Gee! but I slapped him a good one, side of the\nface. Then he give me that eye. Does it look real awful, Til? I should hate\nthat Mr. Nicholson should see it when he comes in for his tea and toast at\nten.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nTildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration. No man had ever\ntried to follow her. She was safe abroad at any hour of the twenty-four. What\nbliss it must have been to have had a man follow one and black one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye\nfor love!\n\n\nAmong the customers at Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was a young man named Seeders, who worked\nin a laundry office. Mr. Seeders was thin and had light hair, and appeared to\nhave been recently rough-dried and starched. He was too diffident to aspire to\nAileen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notice; so he usually sat at one of Tildy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tables, where\nhe devoted himself to silence and boiled weakfish.\n\n\nOne day when Mr. Seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer. There\nwere only two or three customers in the restaurant. When Mr. Seeders had\nfinished his weakfish he got up, put his arm around Tildy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist, kissed\nher loudly and impudently, walked out upon the street, snapped his fingers in\nthe direction of the laundry, and hied himself to play pennies in the slot\nmachines at the Amusement Arcade.\n\n\nFor a few moments Tildy stood petrified. Then she was aware of Aileen shaking\nat her an arch forefinger, and saying:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Til, you naughty girl! Ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you getting to be awful, Miss\nSlyboots! First thing I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be stealing some of my fellows. I\nmust keep an eye on you, my lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAnother thing dawned upon Tildy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovering wits. In a moment she had\nadvanced from a hopeless, lowly admirer to be an Eve-sister of the potent\nAileen. She herself was now a man-charmer, a mark for Cupid, a Sabine who must\nbe coy when the Romans were at their banquet boards. Man had found her waist\nachievable and her lips desirable. The sudden and amatory Seeders had, as it\nwere, performed for her a miraculous piece of one-day laundry work. He had\ntaken the sackcloth of her uncomeliness, had washed, dried, starched and ironed\nit, and returned it to her sheer embroidered lawn\u00e2\u0080\u0094the robe of Venus\nherself.\n\n\nThe freckles on Tildy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeks merged into a rosy flush. Now both Circe\nand Psyche peeped from her brightened eyes. Not even Aileen herself had been\npublicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant.\n\n\nTildy could not keep the delightful secret. When trade was slack she went and\nstood at Bogle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desk. Her eyes were shining; she tried not to let her\nwords sound proud and boastful.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA gentleman insulted me to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe hugged me\naround the waist and kissed me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bogle, cracking open his business armour.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter this week you get a dollar a week more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAt the next regular meal when Tildy set food before customers with whom she had\nacquaintance she said to each of them modestly, as one whose merit needed no\nbolstering:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA gentleman insulted me to-day in the restaurant. He put his arm around\nmy waist and kissed me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe diners accepted the revelation in various ways\u00e2\u0080\u0094some incredulously,\nsome with congratulations; others turned upon her the stream of badinage that\nhad hitherto been directed at Aileen alone. And Tildy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart swelled in\nher bosom, for she saw at last the towers of Romance rise above the horizon of\nthe grey plain in which she had for so long travelled.\n\n\nFor two days Mr. Seeders came not again. During that time Tildy established\nherself firmly as a woman to be wooed. She bought ribbons, and arranged her\nhair like Aileen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and tightened her waist two inches. She had a\nthrilling but delightful fear that Mr. Seeders would rush in suddenly and shoot\nher with a pistol. He must have loved her desperately; and impulsive lovers are\nalways blindly jealous.\n\n\nEven Aileen had not been shot at with a pistol. And then Tildy rather hoped\nthat he would not shoot at her, for she was always loyal to Aileen; and she did\nnot want to overshadow her friend.\n\n\nAt 4 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock on the afternoon of the third day Mr. Seeders came in. There\nwere no customers at the tables. At the back end of the restaurant Tildy was\nrefilling the mustard pots and Aileen was quartering pies. Mr. Seeders walked\nback to where they stood.\n\n\nTildy looked up and saw him, gasped, and pressed the mustard spoon against her\nheart. A red hair-bow was in her hair; she wore Venus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eighth Avenue\nbadge, the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver symbolic heart.\n\n\nMr. Seeders was flushed and embarrassed. He plunged one hand into his hip\npocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Tildy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to apologise for what I done\nthe other evenin\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Tell you the truth, I was pretty well tanked up or I\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t of done it. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do no lady that a-way when I was\nsober. So I hope, Miss Tildy, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll accept my \u00e2\u0080\u0099pology, and believe\nthat I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t of done it if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d known what I was doin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and\nhadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t of been drunk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nWith this handsome plea Mr. Seeders backed away, and departed, feeling that\nreparation had been made.\n\n\nBut behind the convenient screen Tildy had thrown herself flat upon a table\namong the butter chips and the coffee cups, and was sobbing her heart\nout\u00e2\u0080\u0094out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with blunt\nnoses and hay-coloured hair. From her knot she had torn the red hair-bow and\ncast it upon the floor. Seeders she despised utterly; she had but taken his\nkiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who might have set the clocks\ngoing and the pages to running in fairyland. But the kiss had been maudlin and\nunmeant; the court had not stirred at the false alarm; she must forevermore\nremain the Sleeping Beauty.\n\n\nYet not all was lost. Aileen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm was around her; and Tildy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s red\nhand groped among the butter chips till it found the warm clasp of her\nfriend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you fret, Til,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aileen, who did not understand\nentirely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat turnip-faced little clothespin of a Seeders ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nworth it. He ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything of a gentleman or he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever of\napologised.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n",
