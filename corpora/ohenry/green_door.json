    "body": "\nSuppose you should be walking down Broadway after dinner, with ten minutes\nallotted to the consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a\ndiverting tragedy and something serious in the way of vaudeville. Suddenly a\nhand is laid upon your arm. You turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a\nbeautiful woman, wonderful in diamonds and Russian sables. She thrusts\nhurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll, flashes out a tiny\npair of scissors, snips off the second button of your overcoat, meaningly\nejaculates the one word, \u00e2\u0080\u009cparallelogram!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and swiftly flies down a\ncross street, looking back fearfully over her shoulder.\n\n\nThat would be pure adventure. Would you accept it? Not you. You would flush\nwith embarrassment; you would sheepishly drop the roll and continue down\nBroadway, fumbling feebly for the missing button. This you would do unless you\nare one of the blessed few in whom the pure spirit of adventure is not dead.\n\n\nTrue adventurers have never been plentiful. They who are set down in print as\nsuch have been mostly business men with newly invented methods. They have been\nout after the things they wanted\u00e2\u0080\u0094golden fleeces, holy grails, lady loves,\ntreasure, crowns and fame. The true adventurer goes forth aimless and\nuncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate. A fine example was the Prodigal\nSon\u00e2\u0080\u0094when he started back home.\n\n\nHalf-adventurers\u00e2\u0080\u0094brave and splendid figures\u00e2\u0080\u0094have been numerous.\nFrom the Crusades to the Palisades they have enriched the arts of history and\nfiction and the trade of historical fiction. But each of them had a prize to\nwin, a goal to kick, an axe to grind, a race to run, a new thrust in tierce to\ndeliver, a name to carve, a crow to pick\u00e2\u0080\u0094so they were not followers of\ntrue adventure.\n\n\nIn the big city the twin spirits Romance and Adventure are always abroad\nseeking worthy wooers. As we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and\nchallenge us in twenty different guises. Without knowing why, we look up\nsuddenly to see in a window a face that seems to belong to our gallery of\nintimate portraits; in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony and fear\ncoming from an empty and shuttered house; instead of at our familiar curb, a\ncab-driver deposits us before a strange door, which one, with a smile, opens\nfor us and bids us enter; a slip of paper, written upon, flutters down to our\nfeet from the high lattices of Chance; we exchange glances of instantaneous\nhate, affection and fear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds; a\nsudden douse of rain\u00e2\u0080\u0094and our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of\nthe Full Moon and first cousin of the Sidereal System; at every corner\nhandkerchiefs drop, fingers beckon, eyes besiege, and the lost, the lonely, the\nrapturous, the mysterious, the perilous, changing clues of adventure are\nslipped into our fingers. But few of us are willing to hold and follow them. We\nare grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs. We pass on; and\nsome day we come, at the end of a very dull life, to reflect that our romance\nhas been a pallid thing of a marriage or two, a satin rosette kept in a\nsafe-deposit drawer, and a lifelong feud with a steam radiator.\n\n\nRudolf Steiner was a true adventurer. Few were the evenings on which he did not\ngo forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected and the\negregious. The most interesting thing in life seemed to him to be what might\nlie just around the next corner. Sometimes his willingness to tempt fate led\nhim into strange paths. Twice he had spent the night in a station-house; again\nand again he had found himself the dupe of ingenious and mercenary tricksters;\nhis watch and money had been the price of one flattering allurement. But with\nundiminished ardour he picked up every glove cast before him into the merry\nlists of adventure.\n\n\nOne evening Rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the older central\npart of the city. Two streams of people filled the sidewalks\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nhome-hurrying, and that restless contingent that abandons home for the specious\nwelcome of the thousand-candle-power table d\u00e2\u0080\u0099h\u00c3\u00b4te.\n\n\nThe young adventurer was of pleasing presence, and moved serenely and\nwatchfully. By daylight he was a salesman in a piano store. He wore his tie\ndrawn through a topaz ring instead of fastened with a stick pin; and once he\nhad written to the editor of a magazine that \u00e2\u0080\u009cJunie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Love\nTest\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Miss Libbey, had been the book that had most influenced his\nlife.\n\n\nDuring his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the sidewalk\nseemed at first to draw his attention (with a qualm), to a restaurant before\nwhich it was set; but a second glance revealed the electric letters of a\ndentist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sign high above the next door. A giant negro, fantastically\ndressed in a red embroidered coat, yellow trousers and a military cap,\ndiscreetly distributed cards to those of the passing crowd who consented to\ntake them.\n\n\nThis mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to Rudolf. Usually he\npassed the dispenser of the dentist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cards without reducing his store;\nbut tonight the African slipped one into his hand so deftly that he retained it\nthere smiling a little at the successful feat.\n\n\nWhen he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently.\nSurprised, he turned it over and looked again with interest. One side of the\ncard was blank; on the other was written in ink three words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Green\nDoor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then Rudolf saw, three steps in front of him, a man throw down\nthe card the negro had given him as he passed. Rudolf picked it up. It was\nprinted with the dentist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name and address and the usual schedule of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cplate work\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cbridge work\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ccrowns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and specious promises of \u00e2\u0080\u009cpainless\u00e2\u0080\u009d\noperations.\n\n\nThe adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered. Then he\ncrossed the street, walked down a block, recrossed and joined the upward\ncurrent of people again. Without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the\nsecond time, he carelessly took the card that was handed him. Ten steps away he\ninspected it. In the same handwriting that appeared on the first card\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Green Door\u00e2\u0080\u009d was inscribed upon it. Three or four cards were\ntossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him. These\nfell blank side up. Rudolf turned them over. Every one bore the printed legend\nof the dental \u00e2\u0080\u009cparlours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nRarely did the arch sprite Adventure need to beckon twice to Rudolf Steiner,\nhis true follower. But twice it had been done, and the quest was on.\n\n\nRudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of\nrattling teeth. This time as he passed he received no card. In spite of his\ngaudy and ridiculous garb, the Ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity\nas he stood, offering the cards suavely to some, allowing others to pass\nunmolested. Every half minute he chanted a harsh, unintelligible phrase akin to\nthe jabber of car conductors and grand opera. And not only did he withhold a\ncard this time, but it seemed to Rudolf that he received from the shining and\nmassive black countenance a look of cold, almost contemptuous disdain.\n\n\nThe look stung the adventurer. He read in it a silent accusation that he had\nbeen found wanting. Whatever the mysterious written words on the cards might\nmean, the black had selected him twice from the throng for their recipient; and\nnow seemed to have condemned him as deficient in the wit and spirit to engage\nthe enigma.\n\n\nStanding aside from the rush, the young man made a rapid estimate of the\nbuilding in which he conceived that his adventure must lie. Five stories high\nit rose. A small restaurant occupied the basement.\n\n\nThe first floor, now closed, seemed to house millinery or furs. The second\nfloor, by the winking electric letters, was the dentist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Above this a\npolyglot babel of signs struggled to indicate the abodes of palmists,\ndressmakers, musicians and doctors. Still higher up draped curtains and milk\nbottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity.\n\n\nAfter concluding his survey Rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone\nsteps into the house. Up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued; and\nat its top paused. The hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of\ngas\u00e2\u0080\u0094one far to his right, the other nearer, to his left. He looked toward\nthe nearer light and saw, within its wan halo, a green door. For one moment he\nhesitated; then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the African juggler\nof cards; and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it.\n\n\nMoments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the quick\nbreath of true adventure. What might not be behind those green panels!\nGamesters at play; cunning rogues baiting their traps with subtle skill; beauty\nin love with courage, and thus planning to be sought by it; danger, death,\nlove, disappointment, ridicule\u00e2\u0080\u0094any of these might respond to that\ntemerarious rap.\n\n\nA faint rustle was heard inside, and the door slowly opened. A girl not yet\ntwenty stood there, white-faced and tottering. She loosed the knob and swayed\nweakly, groping with one hand. Rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch\nthat stood against the wall. He closed the door and took a swift glance around\nthe room by the light of a flickering gas jet. Neat, but extreme poverty was\nthe story that he read.\n\n\nThe girl lay still, as if in a faint. Rudolf looked around the room excitedly\nfor a barrel. People must be rolled upon a barrel who\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, no; that was\nfor drowned persons. He began to fan her with his hat. That was successful, for\nhe struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she opened her eyes. And then\nthe young man saw that hers, indeed, was the one missing face from his\nheart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gallery of intimate portraits. The frank, grey eyes, the little\nnose, turning pertly outward; the chestnut hair, curling like the tendrils of a\npea vine, seemed the right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures. But\nthe face was wofully thin and pale.\n\n\nThe girl looked at him calmly, and then smiled.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFainted, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, weakly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, who\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t? You try going without anything to eat for three days and\nsee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHimmel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Rudolf, jumping up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait till I come\nback.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nHe dashed out the green door and down the stairs. In twenty minutes he was back\nagain, kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it. With both arms he\nhugged an array of wares from the grocery and the restaurant. On the table he\nlaid them\u00e2\u0080\u0094bread and butter, cold meats, cakes, pies, pickles, oysters, a\nroasted chicken, a bottle of milk and one of red-hot tea.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is ridiculous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rudolf, blusteringly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto go\nwithout eating. You must quit making election bets of this kind. Supper is\nready.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He helped her to a chair at the table and asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there\na cup for the tea?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the shelf by the window,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nanswered. When he turned again with the cup he saw her, with eyes shining\nrapturously, beginning upon a huge Dill pickle that she had rooted out from the\npaper bags with a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unerring instinct. He took it from her,\nlaughingly, and poured the cup full of milk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrink that first\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nordered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand then you shall have some tea, and then a chicken wing. If\nyou are very good you shall have a pickle to-morrow. And now, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nallow me to be your guest we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have supper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nHe drew up the other chair. The tea brightened the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes and\nbrought back some of her colour. She began to eat with a sort of dainty\nferocity like some starved wild animal. She seemed to regard the young\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural\nthing\u00e2\u0080\u0094not as though she undervalued the conventions; but as one whose\ngreat stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human. But\ngradually, with the return of strength and comfort, came also a sense of the\nlittle conventions that belong; and she began to tell him her little story. It\nwas one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every day\u00e2\u0080\u0094the shop\ngirl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story of insufficient wages, further reduced by\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfines\u00e2\u0080\u009d that go to swell the store\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profits; of time lost\nthrough illness; and then of lost positions, lost hope, and\u00e2\u0080\u0094the knock of\nthe adventurer upon the green door.\n\n\nBut to Rudolf the history sounded as big as the Iliad or the crisis in\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJunie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Love Test.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo think of you going through all that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was something fierce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl, solemnly.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you have no relatives or friends in the city?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone whatever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am all alone in the world, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rudolf, after a pause.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl, promptly; and somehow it\npleased the young man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition.\n\n\nVery suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m awfully sleepy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I feel so\ngood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThen Rudolf rose and took his hat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say good-night. A long\nnight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep will be fine for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nHe held out his hand, and she took it and said \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But\nher eyes asked a question so eloquently, so frankly and pathetically that he\nanswered it with words.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m coming back to-morrow to see how you are getting along.\nYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get rid of me so easily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThen, at the door, as though the way of his coming had been so much less\nimportant than the fact that he had come, she asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did you come to\nknock at my door?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nHe looked at her for a moment, remembering the cards, and felt a sudden jealous\npain. What if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous as his? Quickly\nhe decided that she must never know the truth. He would never let her know that\nhe was aware of the strange expedient to which she had been driven by her great\ndistress.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of our piano tuners lives in this house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nknocked at your door by mistake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her smile.\n\n\nAt the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him. And then\nhe went along the hallway to its other end; and, coming back, ascended to the\nfloor above and continued his puzzled explorations. Every door that he found in\nthe house was painted green.\n\n\nWondering, he descended to the sidewalk. The fantastic African was still there.\nRudolf confronted him with his two cards in his hand.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe asked.\n\n\nIn a broad, good-natured grin the negro exhibited a splendid advertisement of\nhis master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profession.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDar it is, boss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, pointing down the street. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099spect you is a little late for de fust act.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nLooking the way he pointed Rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre the\nblazing electric sign of its new play, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Green Door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m informed dat it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fust-rate show, sah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nnegro. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDe agent what represents it pussented me with a dollar, sah, to\ndistribute a few of his cards along with de doctah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. May I offer you one\nof de doctah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cards, sah?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAt the corner of the block in which he lived Rudolf stopped for a glass of beer\nand a cigar. When he had come out with his lighted weed he buttoned his coat,\npushed back his hat and said, stoutly, to the lamp post on the corner:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the same, I believe it was the hand of Fate that doped out the way\nfor me to find her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nWhich conclusion, under the circumstances, certainly admits Rudolf Steiner to\nthe ranks of the true followers of Romance and Adventure.\n",
