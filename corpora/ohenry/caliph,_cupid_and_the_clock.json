    "name": "OHenry - the Caliph, Cupid And the Clock",
    "body": "\nPrince Michael, of the Electorate of Valleluna, sat on his favourite bench in\nthe park. The coolness of the September night quickened the life in him like a\nrare, tonic wine. The benches were not filled; for park loungers, with their\nstagnant blood, are prompt to detect and fly home from the crispness of early\nautumn. The moon was just clearing the roofs of the range of dwellings that\nbounded the quadrangle on the east. Children laughed and played about the\nfine-sprayed fountain. In the shadowed spots fauns and hamadryads wooed,\nunconscious of the gaze of mortal eyes. A hand organ\u00e2\u0080\u0094Philomel by the\ngrace of our stage carpenter, Fancy\u00e2\u0080\u0094fluted and droned in a side street.\nAround the enchanted boundaries of the little park street cars spat and mewed\nand the stilted trains roared like tigers and lions prowling for a place to\nenter. And above the trees shone the great, round, shining face of an\nilluminated clock in the tower of an antique public building.\n\n\nPrince Michael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoes were wrecked far beyond the skill of the\ncarefullest cobbler. The ragman would have declined any negotiations concerning\nhis clothes. The two weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stubble on his face was grey and brown and\nred and greenish yellow\u00e2\u0080\u0094as if it had been made up from individual\ncontributions from the chorus of a musical comedy. No man existed who had money\nenough to wear so bad a hat as his.\n\n\nPrince Michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled. It was a diverting\nthought to him that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those\nclose-ranged, bulky, window-lit mansions that faced him, if he chose. He could\nhave matched gold, equipages, jewels, art treasures, estates and acres with any\nCroesus in this proud city of Manhattan, and scarcely have entered upon the\nbulk of his holdings. He could have sat at table with reigning sovereigns. The\nsocial world, the world of art, the fellowship of the elect, adulation,\nimitation, the homage of the fairest, honours from the highest, praise from the\nwisest, flattery, esteem, credit, pleasure, fame\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the honey of life\nwas waiting in the comb in the hive of the world for Prince Michael, of the\nElectorate of Valleluna, whenever he might choose to take it. But his choice\nwas to sit in rags and dinginess on a bench in a park. For he had tasted of the\nfruit of the tree of life, and, finding it bitter in his mouth, had stepped out\nof Eden for a time to seek distraction close to the unarmoured, beating heart\nof the world.\n\n\nThese thoughts strayed dreamily through the mind of Prince Michael, as he\nsmiled under the stubble of his polychromatic beard. Lounging thus, clad as the\npoorest of mendicants in the parks, he loved to study humanity. He found in\naltruism more pleasure than his riches, his station and all the grosser sweets\nof life had given him. It was his chief solace and satisfaction to alleviate\nindividual distress, to confer favours upon worthy ones who had need of\nsuccour, to dazzle unfortunates by unexpected and bewildering gifts of truly\nroyal magnificence, bestowed, however, with wisdom and judiciousness.\n\n\nAnd as Prince Michael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye rested upon the glowing face of the great\nclock in the tower, his smile, altruistic as it was, became slightly tinged\nwith contempt. Big thoughts were the Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; and it was always with a\nshake of his head that he considered the subjugation of the world to the\narbitrary measures of Time. The comings and goings of people in hurry and\ndread, controlled by the little metal moving hands of a clock, always made him\nsad.\n\n\nBy and by came a young man in evening clothes and sat upon the third bench from\nthe Prince. For half an hour he smoked cigars with nervous haste, and then he\nfell to watching the face of the illuminated clock above the trees. His\nperturbation was evident, and the Prince noted, in sorrow, that its cause was\nconnected, in some manner, with the slowly moving hands of the timepiece.\n\n\nHis Highness arose and went to the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bench.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon for addressing you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I\nperceive that you are disturbed in mind. If it may serve to mitigate the\nliberty I have taken I will add that I am Prince Michael, heir to the throne of\nthe Electorate of Valleluna. I appear incognito, of course, as you may gather\nfrom my appearance. It is a fancy of mine to render aid to others whom I think\nworthy of it. Perhaps the matter that seems to distress you is one that would\nmore readily yield to our mutual efforts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe young man looked up brightly at the Prince. Brightly, but the perpendicular\nline of perplexity between his brows was not smoothed away. He laughed, and\neven then it did not. But he accepted the momentary diversion.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlad to meet you, Prince,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, good humouredly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say you were incog. all right. Thanks for your offer of\nassistance\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see where your butting-in would help things\nany. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a kind of private affair, you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094but thanks all the\nsame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nPrince Michael sat at the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side. He was often rebuffed but\nnever offensively. His courteous manner and words forbade that.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClocks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince, \u00e2\u0080\u009care shackles on the feet of\nmankind. I have observed you looking persistently at that clock. Its face is\nthat of a tyrant, its numbers are false as those on a lottery ticket; its hands\nare those of a bunco steerer, who makes an appointment with you to your ruin.\nLet me entreat you to throw off its humiliating bonds and to cease to order\nyour affairs by that insensate monitor of brass and steel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t usually,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI carry a watch\nexcept when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got my radiant rags on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know human nature as I do the trees and grass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince,\nwith earnest dignity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a master of philosophy, a graduate in art,\nand I hold the purse of a Fortunatus. There are few mortal misfortunes that I\ncannot alleviate or overcome. I have read your countenance, and found in it\nhonesty and nobility as well as distress. I beg of you to accept my advice or\naid. Do not belie the intelligence I see in your face by judging from my\nappearance of my ability to defeat your troubles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe young man glanced at the clock again and frowned darkly. When his gaze\nstrayed from the glowing horologue of time it rested intently upon a four-story\nred brick house in the row of dwellings opposite to where he sat. The shades\nwere drawn, and the lights in many rooms shone dimly through them.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTen minutes to nine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the young man, with an impatient\ngesture of despair. He turned his back upon the house and took a rapid step or\ntwo in a contrary direction.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRemain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d commanded Prince Michael, in so potent a voice that the\ndisturbed one wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give her the ten minutes and then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nmuttered, and then aloud to the Prince: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll join you in\nconfounding all clocks, my friend, and throw in women, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince calmly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not accept your\naddition. Women are the natural enemies of clocks, and, therefore, the allies\nof those who would seek liberation from these monsters that measure our follies\nand limit our pleasures. If you will so far confide in me I would ask you to\nrelate to me your story.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe young man threw himself upon the bench with a reckless laugh.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Royal Highness, I will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in tones of mock deference.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you see yonder house\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one with three upper windows lighted?\nWell, at 6 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock I stood in that house with the young lady I\nam\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, I was\u00e2\u0080\u0094engaged to. I had been doing wrong, my dear\nPrince\u00e2\u0080\u0094I had been a naughty boy, and she had heard of it. I wanted to be\nforgiven, of course\u00e2\u0080\u0094we are always wanting women to forgive us,\naren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we, Prince?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098I want time to think it over,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There is\none thing certain; I will either fully forgive you, or I will never see your\nface again. There will be no half-way business. At half-past eight,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u0098at exactly half-past eight you may be watching the middle upper\nwindow of the top floor. If I decide to forgive I will hang out of that window\na white silk scarf. You will know by that that all is as was before, and you\nmay come to me. If you see no scarf you may consider that everything between us\nis ended forever.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 That,\u00e2\u0080\u009d concluded the young man bitterly,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cis why I have been watching that clock. The time for the signal to\nappear has passed twenty-three minutes ago. Do you wonder that I am a little\ndisturbed, my Prince of Rags and Whiskers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me repeat to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Prince Michael, in his even,\nwell-modulated tones, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat women are the natural enemies of clocks.\nClocks are an evil, women a blessing. The signal may yet appear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever, on your principality!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the young man, hopelessly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know Marian\u00e2\u0080\u0094of course. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always on time,\nto the minute. That was the first thing about her that attracted me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\ngot the mitten instead of the scarf. I ought to have known at 8.31 that my\ngoose was cooked. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go West on the 11.45 to-night with Jack Milburn.\nThe jig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch awhile and top off with\nthe Klondike and whiskey. Good-night\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094Prince.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nPrince Michael smiled his enigmatic, gentle, comprehending smile and caught the\ncoat sleeve of the other. The brilliant light in the Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes was\nsoftening to a dreamier, cloudy translucence.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said solemnly, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctill the clock strikes. I have\nwealth and power and knowledge above most men, but when the clock strikes I am\nafraid. Stay by me until then. This woman shall be yours. You have the word of\nthe hereditary Prince of Valleluna. On the day of your marriage I will give you\n$100,000 and a palace on the Hudson. But there must be no clocks in that\npalace\u00e2\u0080\u0094they measure our follies and limit our pleasures. Do you agree to\nthat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man, cheerfully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a\nnuisance, anyway\u00e2\u0080\u0094always ticking and striking and getting you late for\ndinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nHe glanced again at the clock in the tower. The hands stood at three minutes to\nnine.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Prince Michael, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I will sleep a little.\nThe day has been fatiguing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nHe stretched himself upon a bench with the manner of one who had slept thus\nbefore.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will find me in this park on any evening when the weather is\nsuitable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Prince, sleepily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome to me when your\nmarriage day is set and I will give you a cheque for the money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks, Your Highness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man, seriously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look as if I would need that palace on the Hudson, but I\nappreciate your offer, just the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nPrince Michael sank into deep slumber. His battered hat rolled from the bench\nto the ground. The young man lifted it, placed it over the frowsy face and\nmoved one of the grotesquely relaxed limbs into a more comfortable position.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor devil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he drew the tattered clothes closer about\nthe Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast.\n\n\nSonorous and startling came the stroke of 9 from the clock tower. The young man\nsighed again, turned his face for one last look at the house of his\nrelinquished hopes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and cried aloud profane words of holy rapture.\n\n\nFrom the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving, snowy, fluttering,\nwonderful, divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy.\n\n\nBy came a citizen, rotund, comfortable, home-hurrying, unknowing of the\ndelights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly-lit parks.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you oblige me with the time, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the young man; and\nthe citizen, shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe, dragged it out and\nannounced:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwenty-nine and a half minutes past eight, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAnd then, from habit, he glanced at the clock in the tower, and made further\noration.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy George! that clock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s half an hour fast! First time in ten years\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known it to be off. This watch of mine never varies a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nBut the citizen was talking to vacancy. He turned and saw his hearer, a fast\nreceding black shadow, flying in the direction of a house with three lighted\nupper windows.\n\n\nAnd in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats they\nowned. The park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that sprawled,\nasleep, on a bench. They stopped and gazed upon it.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dopy Mike,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe hits the pipe every\nnight. Park bum for twenty years. On his last legs, I guess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp in the\nhand of the sleeper.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he remarked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doped out a fifty-dollar\nbill, anyway. Wish I knew the brand of hop that he smokes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAnd then \u00e2\u0080\u009cRap, rap, rap!\u00e2\u0080\u009d went the club of realism against the shoe\nsoles of Prince Michael, of the Electorate of Valleluna.\n",
