    "body": "\nFirst Mrs. Parker would show you the double parlours. You would not dare to\ninterrupt her description of their advantages and of the merits of the\ngentleman who had occupied them for eight years. Then you would manage to\nstammer forth the confession that you were neither a doctor nor a dentist. Mrs.\nParker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manner of receiving the admission was such that you could never\nafterward entertain the same feeling toward your parents, who had neglected to\ntrain you up in one of the professions that fitted Mrs. Parker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nparlours.\n\n\nNext you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second-floor-back at\n$8. Convinced by her second-floor manner that it was worth the $12 that Mr.\nToosenberry always paid for it until he left to take charge of his\nbrother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orange plantation in Florida near Palm Beach, where Mrs.\nMcIntyre always spent the winters that had the double front room with private\nbath, you managed to babble that you wanted something still cheaper.\n\n\nIf you survived Mrs. Parker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scorn, you were taken to look at Mr.\nSkidder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large hall room on the third floor. Mr. Skidder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room\nwas not vacant. He wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long. But\nevery room-hunter was made to visit his room to admire the lambrequins. After\neach visit, Mr. Skidder, from the fright caused by possible eviction, would pay\nsomething on his rent.\n\n\nThen\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, then\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you still stood on one foot, with your hot hand\nclutching the three moist dollars in your pocket, and hoarsely proclaimed your\nhideous and culpable poverty, nevermore would Mrs. Parker be cicerone of yours.\nShe would honk loudly the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cClara,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would show you her\nback, and march downstairs. Then Clara, the coloured maid, would escort you up\nthe carpeted ladder that served for the fourth flight, and show you the\nSkylight Room. It occupied 7\u00c3\u00978 feet of floor space at the middle of the\nhall. On each side of it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom.\n\n\nIn it was an iron cot, a washstand and a chair. A shelf was the dresser. Its\nfour bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the sides of a coffin. Your\nhand crept to your throat, you gasped, you looked up as from a well\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nbreathed once more. Through the glass of the little skylight you saw a square\nof blue infinity.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo dollars, suh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clara would say in her half-contemptuous,\nhalf-Tuskegeenial tones.\n\n\nOne day Miss Leeson came hunting for a room. She carried a typewriter made to\nbe lugged around by a much larger lady. She was a very little girl, with eyes\nand hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked\nas if they were saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoodness me! Why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you keep up with\nus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMrs. Parker showed her the double parlours. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this closet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cone could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I am neither a doctor nor a dentist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Leeson, with a\nshiver.\n\n\nMrs. Parker gave her the incredulous, pitying, sneering, icy stare that she\nkept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists, and led the way to\nthe second floor back.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEight dollars?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Leeson. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear me! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not\nHetty if I do look green. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just a poor little working girl. Show me\nsomething higher and lower.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMr. Skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap on his\ndoor.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExcuse me, Mr. Skidder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Parker, with her demon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsmile at his pale looks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know you were in. I asked the\nlady to have a look at your lambrequins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too lovely for anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Leeson, smiling\nin exactly the way the angels do.\n\n\nAfter they had gone Mr. Skidder got very busy erasing the tall, black-haired\nheroine from his latest (unproduced) play and inserting a small, roguish one\nwith heavy, bright hair and vivacious features.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnna Held\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll jump at it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Skidder to himself,\nputting his feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of\nsmoke like an aerial cuttlefish.\n\n\nPresently the tocsin call of \u00e2\u0080\u009cClara!\u00e2\u0080\u009d sounded to the world the\nstate of Miss Leeson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purse. A dark goblin seized her, mounted a Stygian\nstairway, thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top and\nmuttered the menacing and cabalistic words \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo dollars!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d sighed Miss Leeson, sinking down upon the\nsqueaky iron bed.\n\n\nEvery day Miss Leeson went out to work. At night she brought home papers with\nhandwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter. Sometimes she had no\nwork at night, and then she would sit on the steps of the high stoop with the\nother roomers. Miss Leeson was not intended for a sky-light room when the plans\nwere drawn for her creation. She was gay-hearted and full of tender, whimsical\nfancies. Once she let Mr. Skidder read to her three acts of his great\n(unpublished) comedy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s No Kid; or, The Heir of the\nSubway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThere was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever Miss Leeson had time\nto sit on the steps for an hour or two. But Miss Longnecker, the tall blonde\nwho taught in a public school and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, really!\u00e2\u0080\u009d to\neverything you said, sat on the top step and sniffed. And Miss Dorn, who shot\nat the moving ducks at Coney every Sunday and worked in a department store, sat\non the bottom step and sniffed. Miss Leeson sat on the middle step and the men\nwould quickly group around her.\n\n\nEspecially Mr. Skidder, who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a\nprivate, romantic (unspoken) drama in real life. And especially Mr. Hoover, who\nwas forty-five, fat, flush and foolish. And especially very young Mr. Evans,\nwho set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes. The\nmen voted her \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe funniest and jolliest ever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the sniffs on\nthe top step and the lower step were implacable.\n\n\nI pray you let the drama halt while Chorus stalks to the footlights and drops\nan epicedian tear upon the fatness of Mr. Hoover. Tune the pipes to the tragedy\nof tallow, the bane of bulk, the calamity of corpulence. Tried out, Falstaff\nmight have rendered more romance to the ton than would have Romeo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrickety ribs to the ounce. A lover may sigh, but he must not puff. To the train\nof Momus are the fat men remanded. In vain beats the faithfullest heart above a\n52-inch belt. Avaunt, Hoover! Hoover, forty-five, flush and foolish, might\ncarry off Helen herself; Hoover, forty-five, flush, foolish and fat is meat for\nperdition. There was never a chance for you, Hoover.\n\n\nAs Mrs. Parker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roomers sat thus one summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evening, Miss Leeson\nlooked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Billy Jackson! I can see him from down here,\ntoo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAll looked up\u00e2\u0080\u0094some at the windows of skyscrapers, some casting about for\nan airship, Jackson-guided.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that star,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Miss Leeson, pointing with a tiny\nfinger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot the big one that twinkles\u00e2\u0080\u0094the steady blue one near it.\nI can see it every night through my skylight. I named it Billy Jackson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, really!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Longnecker. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nyou were an astronomer, Miss Leeson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the small star gazer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know as much as any\nof them about the style of sleeves they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to wear next fall in\nMars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, really!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Longnecker. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe star you refer to\nis Gamma, of the constellation Cassiopeia. It is nearly of the second\nmagnitude, and its meridian passage is\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the very young Mr. Evans, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Billy Jackson\nis a much better name for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSame here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Hoover, loudly breathing defiance to Miss\nLongnecker. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Miss Leeson has just as much right to name stars as\nany of those old astrologers had.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, really!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Longnecker.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shooting star,\u00e2\u0080\u009d remarked Miss Dorn.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hit nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at Coney\nSunday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up very well from down here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss\nLeeson. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ought to see him from my room. You know you can see stars\neven in the daytime from the bottom of a well. At night my room is like the\nshaft of a coal mine, and it makes Billy Jackson look like the big diamond pin\nthat Night fastens her kimono with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThere came a time after that when Miss Leeson brought no formidable papers home\nto copy. And when she went out in the morning, instead of working, she went\nfrom office to office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals\ntransmitted through insolent office boys. This went on.\n\n\nThere came an evening when she wearily climbed Mrs. Parker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stoop at the\nhour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant. But she had\nhad no dinner.\n\n\nAs she stepped into the hall Mr. Hoover met her and seized his chance. He asked\nher to marry him, and his fatness hovered above her like an avalanche. She\ndodged, and caught the balustrade. He tried for her hand, and she raised it and\nsmote him weakly in the face. Step by step she went up, dragging herself by the\nrailing. She passed Mr. Skidder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door as he was red-inking a stage\ndirection for Myrtle Delorme (Miss Leeson) in his (unaccepted) comedy, to\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cpirouette across stage from L to the side of the Count.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Up the\ncarpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the skylight room.\n\n\nShe was too weak to light the lamp or to undress. She fell upon the iron cot,\nher fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs. And in that Erebus of the\nskylight room, she slowly raised her heavy eyelids, and smiled.\n\n\nFor Billy Jackson was shining down on her, calm and bright and constant through\nthe skylight. There was no world about her. She was sunk in a pit of blackness,\nwith but that small square of pallid light framing the star that she had so\nwhimsically and oh, so ineffectually named. Miss Longnecker must be right; it\nwas Gamma, of the constellation Cassiopeia, and not Billy Jackson. And yet she\ncould not let it be Gamma.\n\n\nAs she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm. The third time she got\ntwo thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to Billy\nJackson. Her arm fell back limply.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye, Billy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured faintly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nmillions of miles away and you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even twinkle once. But you kept\nwhere I could see you most of the time up there when there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nanything else but darkness to look at, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? . . . Millions of\nmiles . . . Good-bye, Billy Jackson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nClara, the coloured maid, found the door locked at 10 the next day, and they\nforced it open. Vinegar, and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving\nof no avail, some one ran to \u00e2\u0080\u0098phone for an ambulance.\n\n\nIn due time it backed up to the door with much gong-clanging, and the capable\nyoung medico, in his white linen coat, ready, active, confident, with his\nsmooth face half debonair, half grim, danced up the steps.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmbulance call to 49,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said briefly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\ntrouble?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sniffed Mrs. Parker, as though her trouble that\nthere should be trouble in the house was the greater. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nthink what can be the matter with her. Nothing we could do would bring her to.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a young woman, a Miss Elsie\u00e2\u0080\u0094yes, a Miss Elsie Leeson. Never\nbefore in my house\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat room?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the doctor in a terrible voice, to which Mrs.\nParker was a stranger.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe skylight room. It\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nEvidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight\nrooms. He was gone up the stairs, four at a time. Mrs. Parker followed slowly,\nas her dignity demanded.\n\n\nOn the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his\narms. He stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue, not loudly.\nGradually Mrs. Parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail.\nEver afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body. Sometimes her\ncurious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet that be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would answer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I can get forgiveness\nfor having heard it I will be satisfied.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that\nfollow the curiosity chase, and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed,\nfor his face was that of one who bears his own dead.\n\n\nThey noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the\nambulance the form that he carried, and all that he said was: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrive like\nh\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093l, Wilson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the driver.\n\n\nThat is all. Is it a story? In the next morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paper I saw a little\nnews item, and the last sentence of it may help you (as it helped me) to weld\nthe incidents together.\n\n\nIt recounted the reception into Bellevue Hospital of a young woman who had been\nremoved from No. 49 East \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 street, suffering from\ndebility induced by starvation. It concluded with these words:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. William Jackson, the ambulance physician who attended the case, says\nthe patient will recover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n",
