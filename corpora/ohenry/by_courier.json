    "body": "\nIt was neither the season nor the hour when the Park had frequenters; and it is\nlikely that the young lady, who was seated on one of the benches at the side of\nthe walk, had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to sit for a while and enjoy a\nforetaste of coming Spring.\n\n\nShe rested there, pensive and still. A certain melancholy that touched her\ncountenance must have been of recent birth, for it had not yet altered the fine\nand youthful contours of her cheek, nor subdued the arch though resolute curve\nof her lips.\n\n\nA tall young man came striding through the park along the path near which she\nsat. Behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit-case. At sight of the young lady,\nthe man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face changed to red and back to pale again. He watched her\ncountenance as he drew nearer, with hope and anxiety mingled on his own. He\npassed within a few yards of her, but he saw no evidence that she was aware of\nhis presence or existence.\n\n\nSome fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at one side.\nThe boy dropped the suit-case and stared at him with wondering, shrewd eyes.\nThe young man took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow. It was a good\nhandkerchief, a good brow, and the young man was good to look at. He said to\nthe boy:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench. Tell her\nI am on my way to the station, to leave for San Francisco, where I shall join\nthat Alaska moose-hunting expedition. Tell her that, since she has commanded me\nneither to speak nor to write to her, I take this means of making one last\nappeal to her sense of justice, for the sake of what has been. Tell her that to\ncondemn and discard one who has not deserved such treatment, without giving him\nher reasons or a chance to explain is contrary to her nature as I believe it to\nbe. Tell her that I have thus, to a certain degree, disobeyed her injunctions,\nin the hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done. Go, and tell her\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe young man dropped a half-dollar into the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand. The boy looked\nat him for a moment with bright, canny eyes out of a dirty, intelligent face,\nand then set off at a run. He approached the lady on the bench a little\ndoubtfully, but unembarrassed. He touched the brim of the old plaid bicycle cap\nperched on the back of his head. The lady looked at him coolly, without\nprejudice or favour.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song\nand dance by me. If yer don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know de guy, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tryin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to\ndo de Johnny act, say de word, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call a cop in t\u00e2\u0080\u0099ree\nminutes. If yer does know him, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on de square, w\u00e2\u0080\u0099y\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he sent yer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe young lady betrayed a faint interest.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA song and dance!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, in a deliberate sweet voice that\nseemed to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA new idea\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the troubadour line, I suppose. I\u00e2\u0080\u0094used to know\nthe gentleman who sent you, so I think it will hardly be necessary to call the\npolice. You may execute your song and dance, but do not sing too loudly. It is\na little early yet for open-air vaudeville, and we might attract\nattention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAwe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy, with a shrug down the length of him,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyer know what I mean, lady. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a turn, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wind.\nHe told me to tell yer he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a\nscoot clean out to \u00e2\u0080\u0099Frisco. Den he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to shoot\nsnow-birds in de Klondike. He says yer told him not to send \u00e2\u0080\u0099round no\nmore pink notes nor come hangin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 over de garden gate, and he takes dis\nmeans of puttin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 yer wise. He says yer refereed him out like a has-been,\nand never give him no chance to kick at de decision. He says yer swiped him,\nand never said why.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe slightly awakened interest in the young lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes did not abate.\nPerhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the\nsnow-bird hunter, in thus circumventing her express commands against the\nordinary modes of communication. She fixed her eye on a statue standing\ndisconsolate in the dishevelled park, and spoke into the transmitter:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell the gentleman that I need not repeat to him a description of my\nideals. He knows what they have been and what they still are. So far as they\ntouch on this case, absolute loyalty and truth are the ones paramount. Tell him\nthat I have studied my own heart as well as one can, and I know its weakness as\nwell as I do its needs. That is why I decline to hear his pleas, whatever they\nmay be. I did not condemn him through hearsay or doubtful evidence, and that is\nwhy I made no charge. But, since he persists in hearing what he already well\nknows, you may convey the matter.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell him that I entered the conservatory that evening from the rear, to\ncut a rose for my mother. Tell him I saw him and Miss Ashburton beneath the\npink oleander. The tableau was pretty, but the pose and juxtaposition were too\neloquent and evident to require explanation. I left the conservatory, and, at\nthe same time, the rose and my ideal. You may carry that song and dance to your\nimpresario.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m shy on one word, lady. Jux\u00e2\u0080\u0094jux\u00e2\u0080\u0094put me wise on dat,\nwill yer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJuxtaposition\u00e2\u0080\u0094or you may call it propinquity\u00e2\u0080\u0094or, if you\nlike, being rather too near for one maintaining the position of an\nideal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe gravel spun from beneath the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet. He stood by the other bench.\nThe man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes interrogated him, hungrily. The boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s were shining\nwith the impersonal zeal of the translator.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDe lady says dat she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a\nfeller comes spielin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ghost stories and tryin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to make up, and\ndat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t listen to no soft-soap. She says she caught yer\ndead to rights, huggin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a bunch o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 calico in de hot-house. She\nside-stepped in to pull some posies and yer was squeezin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 de oder gal to\nbeat de band. She says it looked cute, all right all right, but it made her\nsick. She says yer better git busy, and make a sneak for de train.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden thought.\nHis hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat, and drew out a handful of\nletters. Selecting one, he handed it to the boy, following it with a silver\ndollar from his vest-pocket.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive that letter to the lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand ask her to read\nit. Tell her that it should explain the situation. Tell her that, if she had\nmingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal, much heartache might\nhave been avoided. Tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much has never\nwavered. Tell her I am waiting for an answer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe messenger stood before the lady.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDe gent says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had de ski-bunk put on him widout no cause. He\nsays he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no bum guy; and, lady, yer read dat letter, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet\nyer he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a white sport, all right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe young lady unfolded the letter; somewhat doubtfully, and read it.\n\n\nThe young lady refolded the letter, and handed it to the boy.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDe gent wants an answer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the messenger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nde word?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes suddenly flashed on him, bright, smiling and wet.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell that guy on the other bench,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with a happy,\ntremulous laugh, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat his girl wants him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n",
