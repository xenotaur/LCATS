    "body": "\nIn an art exhibition the other day I saw a painting that had been sold for\n$5,000. The painter was a young scrub out of the West named Kraft, who had a\nfavourite food and a pet theory. His pabulum was an unquenchable belief in the\nUnerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature. His theory was fixed around corned-beef\nhash with poached egg. There was a story behind the picture, so I went home and\nlet it drip out of a fountain-pen. The idea of Kraft\u00e2\u0080\u0094but that is not the\nbeginning of the story.\n\n\nThree years ago Kraft, Bill Judkins (a poet), and I took our meals at\nCypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, on Eighth Avenue. I say \u00e2\u0080\u009ctook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When we had money,\nCypher got it \u00e2\u0080\u009coff of\u00e2\u0080\u009d us, as he expressed it. We had no credit; we\nwent in, called for food and ate it. We paid or we did not pay. We had\nconfidence in Cypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sullenness and smouldering ferocity. Deep down in\nhis sunless soul he was either a prince, a fool or an artist. He sat at a\nworm-eaten desk, covered with files of waiters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 checks so old that I was\nsure the bottomest one was for clams that Hendrik Hudson had eaten and paid\nfor. Cypher had the power, in common with Napoleon III. and the goggle-eyed\nperch, of throwing a film over his eyes, rendering opaque the windows of his\nsoul. Once when we left him unpaid, with egregious excuses, I looked back and\nsaw him shaking with inaudible laughter behind his film. Now and then we paid\nup back scores.\n\n\nBut the chief thing at Cypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was Milly. Milly was a waitress. She was\na grand example of Kraft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theory of the artistic adjustment of nature.\nShe belonged, largely, to waiting, as Minerva did to the art of scrapping, or\nVenus to the science of serious flirtation. Pedestalled and in bronze she might\nhave stood with the noblest of her heroic sisters as \u00e2\u0080\u009cLiver-and-Bacon\nEnlivening the World.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She belonged to Cypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. You expected to\nsee her colossal figure loom through that reeking blue cloud of smoke from\nfrying fat just as you expect the Palisades to appear through a drifting Hudson\nRiver fog. There amid the steam of vegetables and the vapours of acres of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cham and,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the crash of crockery, the clatter of steel, the\nscreaming of \u00e2\u0080\u009cshort orders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cries of the hungering and all the\nhorrid tumult of feeding man, surrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts\nbequeathed us by Pharaoh, Milly steered her magnificent way like some great\nliner cleaving among the canoes of howling savages.\n\n\nOur Goddess of Grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be followed\nonly with awe. Her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows. She could have\ntaken us three musketeers in her two hands and dropped us out of the window.\nShe had seen fewer years than any of us, but she was of such superb Evehood and\nsimplicity that she mothered us from the beginning. Cypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s store of\neatables she poured out upon us with royal indifference to price and quantity,\nas from a cornucopia that knew no exhaustion. Her voice rang like a great\nsilver bell; her smile was many-toothed and frequent; she seemed like a yellow\nsunrise on mountain tops. I never saw her but I thought of the Yosemite. And\nyet, somehow, I could never think of her as existing outside of Cypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nThere nature had placed her, and she had taken root and grown mightily. She\nseemed happy, and took her few poor dollars on Saturday nights with the flushed\npleasure of a child that receives an unexpected donation.\n\n\nIt was Kraft who first voiced the fear that each of us must have held latently.\nIt came up apropos, of course, of certain questions of art at which we were\nhammering. One of us compared the harmony existing between a Haydn symphony and\npistache ice cream to the exquisite congruity between Milly and Cypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a certain fate hanging over Milly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kraft,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand if it overtakes her she is lost to Cypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and to us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will grow fat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Judkins, fearsomely.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will go to night school and become refined?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I ventured\nanxiously.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kraft, punctuating in a puddle of spilled coffee\nwith a stiff forefinger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaesar had his Brutus\u00e2\u0080\u0094the cotton has its\nbollworm, the chorus girl has her Pittsburger, the summer boarder has his\npoison ivy, the hero has his Carnegie medal, art has its Morgan, the rose has\nits\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I interrupted, much perturbed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do not think\nthat Milly will begin to lace?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d concluded Kraft, solemnly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere will come to\nCypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for a plate of beans a millionaire lumberman from Wisconsin, and\nhe will marry Milly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Judkins and I, in horror.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lumberman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Kraft, hoarsely.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd a millionaire lumberman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I sighed, despairingly.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom Wisconsin!\u00e2\u0080\u009d groaned Judkins.\n\n\nWe agreed that the awful fate seemed to menace her. Few things were less\nimprobable. Milly, like some vast virgin stretch of pine woods, was made to\ncatch the lumberman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye. And well we knew the habits of the Badgers,\nonce fortune smiled upon them. Straight to New York they hie, and lay their\ngoods at the feet of the girl who serves them beans in a beanery. Why, the\nalphabet itself connives. The Sunday newspaper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headliner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work\nis cut for him.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWinsome Waitress Wins Wealthy Wisconsin Woodsman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nFor a while we felt that Milly was on the verge of being lost to us.\n\n\nIt was our love of the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature that inspired us.\nWe could not give her over to a lumberman, doubly accursed by wealth and\nprovincialism. We shuddered to think of Milly, with her voice modulated and her\nelbows covered, pouring tea in the marble teepee of a tree murderer. No! In\nCypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s she belonged\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the bacon smoke, the cabbage perfume, the\ngrand, Wagnerian chorus of hurled ironstone china and rattling casters.\n\n\nOur fears must have been prophetic, for on that same evening the wildwood\ndischarged upon us Milly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preordained confiscator\u00e2\u0080\u0094our fee to\nadjustment and order. But Alaska and not Wisconsin bore the burden of the\nvisitation.\n\n\nWe were at our supper of beef stew and dried apples when he trotted in as if on\nthe heels of a dog team, and made one of the mess at our table. With the\nfreedom of the camps he assaulted our ears and claimed the fellowship of men\nlost in the wilds of a hash house. We embraced him as a specimen, and in three\nminutes we had all but died for one another as friends.\n\n\nHe was rugged and bearded and wind-dried. He had just come off the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ctrail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, at one of the North River ferries. I fancied I\ncould see the snow dust of Chilcoot yet powdering his shoulders. And then he\nstrewed the table with the nuggets, stuffed ptarmigans, bead work and seal\npelts of the returned Klondiker, and began to prate to us of his millions.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBank drafts for two millions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his summing up, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand a\nthousand a day piling up from my claims. And now I want some beef stew and\ncanned peaches. I never got off the train since I mushed out of Seattle, and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hungry. The stuff the niggers feed you on Pullmans don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count.\nYou gentlemen order what you want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAnd then Milly loomed up with a thousand dishes on her bare arm\u00e2\u0080\u0094loomed up\nbig and white and pink and awful as Mount Saint Elias\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a smile like\nday breaking in a gulch. And the Klondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as\ndross, and let his jaw fall half-way, and stared at her. You could almost see\nthe diamond tiaras on Milly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brow and the hand-embroidered silk Paris\ngowns that he meant to buy for her.\n\n\nAt last the bollworm had attacked the cotton\u00e2\u0080\u0094the poison ivy was reaching\nout its tendrils to entwine the summer boarder\u00e2\u0080\u0094the millionaire lumberman,\nthinly disguised as the Alaskan miner, was about to engulf our Milly and upset\nNature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adjustment.\n\n\nKraft was the first to act. He leaped up and pounded the Klondiker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nback. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome out and drink,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrink first and eat\nafterward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Judkins seized one arm and I the other. Gaily, roaringly,\nirresistibly, in jolly-good-fellow style, we dragged him from the restaurant to\na caf\u00c3\u00a9, stuffing his pockets with his embalmed birds and indigestible nuggets.\n\n\nThere he rumbled a roughly good-humoured protest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the girl\nfor my money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he declared. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe can eat out of my skillet the rest\nof her life. Why, I never see such a fine girl. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going back there and\nask her to marry me. I guess she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to sling hash any more when\nshe sees the pile of dust I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take another whiskey and milk now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kraft persuaded,\nwith Satan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you up-country fellows were better\nsports.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nKraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave Judkins and me such\nan appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in toasting our\nguest.\n\n\nThen, when our ammunition was gone and the Klondiker, still somewhat sober,\nbegan to babble again of Milly, Kraft whispered into his ear such a polite,\nbarbed insult relating to people who were miserly with their funds, that the\nminer crashed down handful after handful of silver and notes, calling for all\nthe fluids in the world to drown the imputation.\n\n\nThus the work was accomplished. With his own guns we drove him from the field.\nAnd then we had him carted to a distant small hotel and put to bed with his\nnuggets and baby seal-skins stuffed around him.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe will never find Cypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kraft. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\nwill propose to the first white apron he sees in a dairy restaurant to-morrow.\nAnd Milly\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean the Natural Adjustment\u00e2\u0080\u0094is saved!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAnd back to Cypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s went we three, and, finding customers scarce, we\njoined hands and did an Indian dance with Milly in the centre.\n\n\nThis, I say, happened three years ago. And about that time a little luck\ndescended upon us three, and we were enabled to buy costlier and less wholesome\nfood than Cypher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Our paths separated, and I saw Kraft no more and\nJudkins seldom.\n\n\nBut, as I said, I saw a painting the other day that was sold for $5,000. The\ntitle was \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoadicea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the figure seemed to fill all\nout-of-doors. But of all the picture\u00e2\u0080\u0099s admirers who stood before it, I\nbelieve I was the only one who longed for Boadicea to stalk from her frame,\nbringing me corned-beef hash with poached egg.\n\n\nI hurried away to see Kraft. His satanic eyes were the same, his hair was worse\ntangled, but his clothes had been made by a tailor.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to him.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve bought a cottage in the Bronx with the money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny evening at 7.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen you led us against the\nlumberman\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\u00e2\u0080\u0094Klondiker\u00e2\u0080\u0094it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t altogether on account\nof the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, not altogether,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kraft, with a grin.\n",
