    "body": "\nWhen one loves one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Art no service seems too hard.\n\n\nThat is our premise. This story shall draw a conclusion from it, and show at\nthe same time that the premise is incorrect. That will be a new thing in logic,\nand a feat in story-telling somewhat older than the great wall of China.\n\n\nJoe Larrabee came out of the post-oak flats of the Middle West pulsing with a\ngenius for pictorial art. At six he drew a picture of the town pump with a\nprominent citizen passing it hastily. This effort was framed and hung in the\ndrug store window by the side of the ear of corn with an uneven number of rows.\nAt twenty he left for New York with a flowing necktie and a capital tied up\nsomewhat closer.\n\n\nDelia Caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pine-tree village\nin the South that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip hat for her to go\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNorth\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They could not see her f\u00e2\u0080\u0094,\nbut that is our story.\n\n\nJoe and Delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students had\ngathered to discuss chiaroscuro, Wagner, music, Rembrandt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s works,\npictures, Waldteufel, wall paper, Chopin and Oolong.\n\n\nJoe and Delia became enamoured one of the other, or each of the other, as you\nplease, and in a short time were married\u00e2\u0080\u0094for (see above), when one loves\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Art no service seems too hard.\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Larrabee began housekeeping in a flat. It was a lonesome\nflat\u00e2\u0080\u0094something like the A sharp way down at the left-hand end of the\nkeyboard. And they were happy; for they had their Art, and they had each other.\nAnd my advice to the rich young man would be\u00e2\u0080\u0094sell all thou hast, and give\nit to the poor\u00e2\u0080\u0094janitor for the privilege of living in a flat with your\nArt and your Delia.\n\n\nFlat-dwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true happiness.\nIf a home is happy it cannot fit too close\u00e2\u0080\u0094let the dresser collapse and\nbecome a billiard table; let the mantel turn to a rowing machine, the\nescritoire to a spare bedchamber, the washstand to an upright piano; let the\nfour walls come together, if they will, so you and your Delia are between. But\nif home be the other kind, let it be wide and long\u00e2\u0080\u0094enter you at the\nGolden Gate, hang your hat on Hatteras, your cape on Cape Horn and go out by\nthe Labrador.\n\n\nJoe was painting in the class of the great Magister\u00e2\u0080\u0094you know his fame.\nHis fees are high; his lessons are light\u00e2\u0080\u0094his high-lights have brought him\nrenown. Delia was studying under Rosenstock\u00e2\u0080\u0094you know his repute as a\ndisturber of the piano keys.\n\n\nThey were mighty happy as long as their money lasted. So is every\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I\nwill not be cynical. Their aims were very clear and defined. Joe was to become\ncapable very soon of turning out pictures that old gentlemen with thin\nside-whiskers and thick pocketbooks would sandbag one another in his studio for\nthe privilege of buying. Delia was to become familiar and then contemptuous\nwith Music, so that when she saw the orchestra seats and boxes unsold she could\nhave sore throat and lobster in a private dining-room and refuse to go on the\nstage.\n\n\nBut the best, in my opinion, was the home life in the little flat\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nardent, voluble chats after the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s study; the cozy dinners and fresh,\nlight breakfasts; the interchange of ambitions\u00e2\u0080\u0094ambitions interwoven each\nwith the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or else inconsiderable\u00e2\u0080\u0094the mutual help and\ninspiration; and\u00e2\u0080\u0094overlook my artlessness\u00e2\u0080\u0094stuffed olives and cheese\nsandwiches at 11 p.m.\n\n\nBut after a while Art flagged. It sometimes does, even if some switchman\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t flag it. Everything going out and nothing coming in, as the\nvulgarians say. Money was lacking to pay Mr. Magister and Herr Rosenstock their\nprices. When one loves one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Art no service seems too hard. So, Delia\nsaid she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling.\n\n\nFor two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils. One evening she came\nhome elated.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJoe, dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, gleefully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve a pupil. And,\noh, the loveliest people! General\u00e2\u0080\u0094General A. B. Pinkney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndaughter\u00e2\u0080\u0094on Seventy-first street. Such a splendid house, Joe\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\nought to see the front door! Byzantine I think you would call it. And inside!\nOh, Joe, I never saw anything like it before.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy pupil is his daughter Clementina. I dearly love her already.\nShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a delicate thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094dresses always in white; and the sweetest,\nsimplest manners! Only eighteen years old. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m to give three lessons a\nweek; and, just think, Joe! $5 a lesson. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind it a bit; for when\nI get two or three more pupils I can resume my lessons with Herr Rosenstock.\nNow, smooth out that wrinkle between your brows, dear, and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have a\nnice supper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right for you, Dele,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe, attacking a can\nof peas with a carving knife and a hatchet, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut how about me? Do you\nthink I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to let you hustle for wages while I philander in the\nregions of high art? Not by the bones of Benvenuto Cellini! I guess I can sell\npapers or lay cobblestones, and bring in a dollar or two.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nDelia came and hung about his neck.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJoe, dear, you are silly. You must keep on at your studies. It is not as\nif I had quit my music and gone to work at something else. While I teach I\nlearn. I am always with my music. And we can live as happily as millionaires on\n$15 a week. You mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of leaving Mr. Magister.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe, reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable\ndish. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I hate for you to be giving lessons. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Art. But\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a trump and a dear to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen one loves one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Art no service seems too hard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nDelia.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMagister praised the sky in that sketch I made in the park,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nJoe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window. I\nmay sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Delia, sweetly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now\nlet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be thankful for Gen. Pinkney and this veal roast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nDuring all of the next week the Larrabees had an early breakfast. Joe was\nenthusiastic about some morning-effect sketches he was doing in Central Park,\nand Delia packed him off breakfasted, coddled, praised and kissed at 7\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. Art is an engaging mistress. It was most times 7 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\nwhen he returned in the evening.\n\n\nAt the end of the week Delia, sweetly proud but languid, triumphantly tossed\nthree five-dollar bills on the 8\u00c3\u009710 (inches) centre table of the\n8\u00c3\u009710 (feet) flat parlour.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, a little wearily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cClementina tries\nme. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t practise enough, and I have to tell her\nthe same things so often. And then she always dresses entirely in white, and\nthat does get monotonous. But Gen. Pinkney is the dearest old man! I wish you\ncould know him, Joe. He comes in sometimes when I am with Clementina at the\npiano\u00e2\u0080\u0094he is a widower, you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094and stands there pulling his white\ngoatee. \u00e2\u0080\u0098And how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers\nprogressing?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he always asks.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawing-room, Joe! And\nthose Astrakhan rug porti\u00c3\u00a8res. And Clementina has such a funny little\ncough. I hope she is stronger than she looks. Oh, I really am getting attached\nto her, she is so gentle and high bred. Gen. Pinkney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother was once\nMinister to Bolivia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAnd then Joe, with the air of a Monte Cristo, drew forth a ten, a five, a two\nand a one\u00e2\u0080\u0094all legal tender notes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and laid them beside Delia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nearnings.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from Peoria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nannounced overwhelmingly.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t joke with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Delia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot from\nPeoria!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the way. I wish you could see him, Dele. Fat man with a woollen\nmuffler and a quill toothpick. He saw the sketch in Tinkle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window and\nthought it was a windmill at first. He was game, though, and bought it anyhow.\nHe ordered another\u00e2\u0080\u0094an oil sketch of the Lackawanna freight depot\u00e2\u0080\u0094to\ntake back with him. Music lessons! Oh, I guess Art is still in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kept on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Delia, heartily.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bound to win, dear. Thirty-three dollars! We never had so\nmuch to spend before. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have oysters to-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd filet mignon with champignons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is the\nolive fork?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nOn the next Saturday evening Joe reached home first. He spread his $18 on the\nparlour table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his\nhands.\n\n\nHalf an hour later Delia arrived, her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle\nof wraps and bandages.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Joe after the usual greetings. Delia laughed,\nbut not very joyously.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClementina,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cinsisted upon a Welsh rabbit\nafter her lesson. She is such a queer girl. Welsh rabbits at 5 in the\nafternoon. The General was there. You should have seen him run for the chafing\ndish, Joe, just as if there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a servant in the house. I know\nClementina isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in good health; she is so nervous. In serving the rabbit\nshe spilled a great lot of it, boiling hot, over my hand and wrist. It hurt\nawfully, Joe. And the dear girl was so sorry! But Gen. Pinkney!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Joe, that\nold man nearly went distracted. He rushed downstairs and sent\nsomebody\u00e2\u0080\u0094they said the furnace man or somebody in the basement\u00e2\u0080\u0094out\nto a drug store for some oil and things to bind it up with. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhurt so much now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Joe, taking the hand tenderly and\npulling at some white strands beneath the bandages.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something soft,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Delia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat had oil on it.\nOh, Joe, did you sell another sketch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She had seen the money on the\ntable.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe; \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust ask the man from Peoria. He got his\ndepot to-day, and he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape\nand a view on the Hudson. What time this afternoon did you burn your hand,\nDele?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFive o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dele, plaintively. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\niron\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time. You ought to\nhave seen Gen. Pinkney, Joe, when\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down here a moment, Dele,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe. He drew her to the couch,\nsat beside her and put his arm across her shoulders.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have you been doing for the last two weeks, Dele?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\nShe braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness,\nand murmured a phrase or two vaguely of Gen. Pinkney; but at length down went\nher head and out came the truth and tears.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get any pupils,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she confessed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\ncouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear to have you give up your lessons; and I got a place ironing\nshirts in that big Twenty-fourth street laundry. And I think I did very well to\nmake up both General Pinkney and Clementina, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you, Joe? And when a\ngirl in the laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon I was all the\nway home making up that story about the Welsh rabbit. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not angry,\nare you, Joe? And if I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got the work you mightn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have sold\nyour sketches to that man from Peoria.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t from Peoria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe, slowly.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter where he was from. How clever you are,\nJoe\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\u00e2\u0080\u0094kiss me, Joe\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what made you ever suspect that I\nwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t giving music lessons to Clementina?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cuntil to-night. And I\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have then, only I sent up this cotton waste and oil from the\nengine-room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a\nsmoothing-iron. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been firing the engine in that laundry for the last\ntwo weeks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy purchaser from Peoria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Gen. Pinkney are\nboth creations of the same art\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call it either\npainting or music.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAnd then they both laughed, and Joe began:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen one loves one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Art no service seems\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nBut Delia stopped him with her hand on his lips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cjust \u00e2\u0080\u0098When one loves.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n",
