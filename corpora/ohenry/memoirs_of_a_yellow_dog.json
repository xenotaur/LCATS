    "body": "\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose it will knock any of you people off your perch to read a\ncontribution from an animal. Mr. Kipling and a good many others have\ndemonstrated the fact that animals can express themselves in remunerative\nEnglish, and no magazine goes to press nowadays without an animal story in it,\nexcept the old-style monthlies that are still running pictures of Bryan and the\nMont P\u00c3\u00a9lee horror.\n\n\nBut you needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look for any stuck-up literature in my piece, such as\nBearoo, the bear, and Snakoo, the snake, and Tammanoo, the tiger, talk in the\njungle books. A yellow dog that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spent most of his life in a cheap New\nYork flat, sleeping in a corner on an old sateen underskirt (the one she\nspilled port wine on at the Lady Longshoremen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s banquet), mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbe expected to perform any tricks with the art of speech.\n\n\nI was born a yellow pup; date, locality, pedigree and weight unknown. The first\nthing I can recollect, an old woman had me in a basket at Broadway and\nTwenty-third trying to sell me to a fat lady. Old Mother Hubbard was boosting\nme to beat the band as a genuine\nPomeranian-Hambletonian-Red-Irish-Cochin-China-Stoke-Pogis fox terrier. The fat\nlady chased a V around among the samples of gros grain flannelette in her\nshopping bag till she cornered it, and gave up. From that moment I was a\npet\u00e2\u0080\u0094a mamma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own wootsey squidlums. Say, gentle reader, did you\never have a 200-pound woman breathing a flavour of Camembert cheese and Peau\nd\u00e2\u0080\u0099Espagne pick you up and wallop her nose all over you, remarking all the\ntime in an Emma Eames tone of voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, oo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s um oodlum, doodlum,\nwoodlum, toodlum, bitsy-witsy skoodlums?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nFrom a pedigreed yellow pup I grew up to be an anonymous yellow cur looking\nlike a cross between an Angora cat and a box of lemons. But my mistress never\ntumbled. She thought that the two primeval pups that Noah chased into the ark\nwere but a collateral branch of my ancestors. It took two policemen to keep her\nfrom entering me at the Madison Square Garden for the Siberian bloodhound\nprize.\n\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you about that flat. The house was the ordinary thing in New\nYork, paved with Parian marble in the entrance hall and cobblestones above the\nfirst floor. Our flat was three\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, not flights\u00e2\u0080\u0094climbs up. My\nmistress rented it unfurnished, and put in the regular things\u00e2\u0080\u00941903\nantique unholstered parlour set, oil chromo of geishas in a Harlem tea house,\nrubber plant and husband.\n\n\nBy Sirius! there was a biped I felt sorry for. He was a little man with sandy\nhair and whiskers a good deal like mine. Henpecked?\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, toucans and\nflamingoes and pelicans all had their bills in him. He wiped the dishes and\nlistened to my mistress tell about the cheap, ragged things the lady with the\nsquirrel-skin coat on the second floor hung out on her line to dry. And every\nevening while she was getting supper she made him take me out on the end of a\nstring for a walk.\n\n\nIf men knew how women pass the time when they are alone they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never\nmarry. Laura Lean Jibbey, peanut brittle, a little almond cream on the neck\nmuscles, dishes unwashed, half an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk with the iceman, reading a\npackage of old letters, a couple of pickles and two bottles of malt extract,\none hour peeking through a hole in the window shade into the flat across the\nair-shaft\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about all there is to it. Twenty minutes before\ntime for him to come home from work she straightens up the house, fixes her rat\nso it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show, and gets out a lot of sewing for a ten-minute bluff.\n\n\nI led a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life in that flat. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Most all day I lay there in my\ncorner watching that fat woman kill time. I slept sometimes and had pipe dreams\nabout being out chasing cats into basements and growling at old ladies with\nblack mittens, as a dog was intended to do. Then she would pounce upon me with\na lot of that drivelling poodle palaver and kiss me on the nose\u00e2\u0080\u0094but what\ncould I do? A dog can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t chew cloves.\n\n\nI began to feel sorry for Hubby, dog my cats if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. We looked so\nmuch alike that people noticed it when we went out; so we shook the streets\nthat Morgan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cab drives down, and took to climbing the piles of last\nDecember\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snow on the streets where cheap people live.\n\n\nOne evening when we were thus promenading, and I was trying to look like a\nprize St. Bernard, and the old man was trying to look like he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave murdered the first organ-grinder he heard play Mendelssohn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwedding-march, I looked up at him and said, in my way:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you looking so sour about, you oakum trimmed lobster? She\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kiss you. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to sit on her lap and listen to talk\nthat would make the book of a musical comedy sound like the maxims of\nEpictetus. You ought to be thankful you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not a dog. Brace up, Benedick,\nand bid the blues begone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe matrimonial mishap looked down at me with almost canine intelligence in his\nface.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, doggie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood doggie. You almost look like\nyou could speak. What is it, doggie\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cats?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nCats! Could speak!\n\n\nBut, of course, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand. Humans were denied the speech of\nanimals. The only common ground of communication upon which dogs and men can\nget together is in fiction.\n\n\nIn the flat across the hall from us lived a lady with a black-and-tan terrier.\nHer husband strung it and took it out every evening, but he always came home\ncheerful and whistling. One day I touched noses with the black-and-tan in the\nhall, and I struck him for an elucidation.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee, here, Wiggle-and-Skip,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know that it\nain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the nature of a real man to play dry nurse to a dog in public. I\nnever saw one leashed to a bow-wow yet that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nlike to lick every other man that looked at him. But your boss comes in every\nday as perky and set up as an amateur prestidigitator doing the egg trick. How\ndoes he do it? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me he likes it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHim?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the black-and-tan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, he uses Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nOwn Remedy. He gets spifflicated. At first when we go out he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as shy as\nthe man on the steamer who would rather play pedro when they make \u00e2\u0080\u0099em all\njackpots. By the time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in eight saloons he don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care\nwhether the thing on the end of his line is a dog or a catfish. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost\ntwo inches of my tail trying to sidestep those swinging doors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe pointer I got from that terrier\u00e2\u0080\u0094vaudeville please copy\u00e2\u0080\u0094set me\nto thinking.\n\n\nOne evening about 6 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock my mistress ordered him to get busy and do\nthe ozone act for Lovey. I have concealed it until now, but that is what she\ncalled me. The black-and-tan was called \u00e2\u0080\u009cTweetness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I consider\nthat I have the bulge on him as far as you could chase a rabbit. Still\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLovey\u00e2\u0080\u009d is something of a nomenclatural tin can on the tail of\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self respect.\n\n\nAt a quiet place on a safe street I tightened the line of my custodian in front\nof an attractive, refined saloon. I made a dead-ahead scramble for the doors,\nwhining like a dog in the press despatches that lets the family know that\nlittle Alice is bogged while gathering lilies in the brook.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, darn my eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the old man, with a grin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdarn my\neyes if the saffron-coloured son of a seltzer lemonade ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t asking me in\nto take a drink. Lemme see\u00e2\u0080\u0094how long\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it been since I saved shoe\nleather by keeping one foot on the foot-rest? I believe\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nI knew I had him. Hot Scotches he took, sitting at a table. For an hour he kept\nthe Campbells coming. I sat by his side rapping for the waiter with my tail,\nand eating free lunch such as mamma in her flat never equalled with her\nhomemade truck bought at a delicatessen store eight minutes before papa comes\nhome.\n\n\nWhen the products of Scotland were all exhausted except the rye bread the old\nman unwound me from the table leg and played me outside like a fisherman plays\na salmon. Out there he took off my collar and threw it into the street.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor doggie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood doggie. She shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kiss\nyou any more. \u00e2\u0080\u0099S a darned shame. Good doggie, go away and get run over by\na street car and be happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nI refused to leave. I leaped and frisked around the old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs happy\nas a pug on a rug.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou old flea-headed woodchuck-chaser,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to\nhim\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou moon-baying, rabbit-pointing, egg-stealing old beagle,\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to leave you? Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see\nthat we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both Pups in the Wood and the missis is the cruel uncle after\nyou with the dish towel and me with the flea liniment and a pink bow to tie on\nmy tail. Why not cut that all out and be pards forever more?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMaybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nBut he kind of got a grip on the Hot Scotches, and stood still for a minute,\nthinking.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoggie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, finally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live more than a\ndozen lives on this earth, and very few of us live to be more than 300. If I\never see that flat any more I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a flat, and if you do you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nflatter; and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no flattery. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m offering 60 to 1 that Westward\nHo wins out by the length of a dachshund.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThere was no string, but I frolicked along with my master to the Twenty-third\nstreet ferry. And the cats on the route saw reason to give thanks that\nprehensile claws had been given them.\n\n\nOn the Jersey side my master said to a stranger who stood eating a currant bun:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMe and my doggie, we are bound for the Rocky Mountains.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nBut what pleased me most was when my old man pulled both of my ears until I\nhowled, and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou common, monkey-headed, rat-tailed, sulphur-coloured son of a door\nmat, do you know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to call you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nI thought of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLovey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and I whined dolefully.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to call you \u00e2\u0080\u0098Pete,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d says my master;\nand if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had five tails I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have done enough wagging to do\njustice to the occasion.\n",
