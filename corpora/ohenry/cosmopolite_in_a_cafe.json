    "name": "OHenry - a Cosmopolite In a Caf\u00e9",
    "body": "\nAt midnight the caf\u00c3\u00a9 was crowded. By some chance the little table at which I\nsat had escaped the eye of incomers, and two vacant chairs at it extended their\narms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons.\n\n\nAnd then a cosmopolite sat in one of them, and I was glad, for I held a theory\nthat since Adam no true citizen of the world has existed. We hear of them, and\nwe see foreign labels on much luggage, but we find travellers instead of\ncosmopolites.\n\n\nI invoke your consideration of the scene\u00e2\u0080\u0094the marble-topped tables, the\nrange of leather-upholstered wall seats, the gay company, the ladies dressed in\ndemi-state toilets, speaking in an exquisite visible chorus of taste, economy,\nopulence or art; the sedulous and largess-loving gar\u00c3\u00a7ons, the\nmusic wisely catering to all with its raids upon the composers; the\nm\u00c3\u00a9lange of talk and laughter\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, if you will, the\nW\u00c3\u00bcrzburger in the tall glass cones that bend to your lips as a ripe cherry\nsways on its branch to the beak of a robber jay. I was told by a sculptor from\nMauch Chunk that the scene was truly Parisian.\n\n\nMy cosmopolite was named E. Rushmore Coglan, and he will be heard from next\nsummer at Coney Island. He is to establish a new \u00e2\u0080\u009cattraction\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nthere, he informed me, offering kingly diversion. And then his conversation\nrang along parallels of latitude and longitude. He took the great, round world\nin his hand, so to speak, familiarly, contemptuously, and it seemed no larger\nthan the seed of a Maraschino cherry in a table d\u00e2\u0080\u0099h\u00c3\u00b4te grape\nfruit. He spoke disrespectfully of the equator, he skipped from continent to\ncontinent, he derided the zones, he mopped up the high seas with his napkin.\nWith a wave of his hand he would speak of a certain bazaar in Hyderabad. Whiff!\nHe would have you on skis in Lapland. Zip! Now you rode the breakers with the\nKanakas at Kealaikahiki. Presto! He dragged you through an Arkansas post-oak\nswamp, let you dry for a moment on the alkali plains of his Idaho ranch, then\nwhirled you into the society of Viennese archdukes. Anon he would be telling\nyou of a cold he acquired in a Chicago lake breeze and how old Escamila cured\nit in Buenos Ayres with a hot infusion of the chuchula weed. You would\nhave addressed a letter to \u00e2\u0080\u009cE. Rushmore Coglan, Esq., the Earth, Solar\nSystem, the Universe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and have mailed it, feeling confident that it\nwould be delivered to him.\n\n\nI was sure that I had found at last the one true cosmopolite since Adam, and I\nlistened to his worldwide discourse fearful lest I should discover in it the\nlocal note of the mere globe-trotter. But his opinions never fluttered or\ndrooped; he was as impartial to cities, countries and continents as the winds\nor gravitation.\n\n\nAnd as E. Rushmore Coglan prattled of this little planet I thought with glee of\na great almost-cosmopolite who wrote for the whole world and dedicated himself\nto Bombay. In a poem he has to say that there is pride and rivalry between the\ncities of the earth, and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe men that breed from them, they traffic\nup and down, but cling to their cities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hem as a child to the\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And whenever they walk \u00e2\u0080\u009cby roaring streets\nunknown\u00e2\u0080\u009d they remember their native city \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost faithful, foolish,\nfond; making her mere-breathed name their bond upon their bond.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And my\nglee was roused because I had caught Mr. Kipling napping. Here I had found a\nman not made from dust; one who had no narrow boasts of birthplace or country,\none who, if he bragged at all, would brag of his whole round globe against the\nMartians and the inhabitants of the Moon.\n\n\nExpression on these subjects was precipitated from E. Rushmore Coglan by the\nthird corner to our table. While Coglan was describing to me the topography\nalong the Siberian Railway the orchestra glided into a medley. The concluding\nair was \u00e2\u0080\u009cDixie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and as the exhilarating notes tumbled forth they\nwere almost overpowered by a great clapping of hands from almost every table.\n\n\nIt is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be witnessed\nevery evening in numerous caf\u00c3\u00a9s in the City of New York. Tons of brew have been\nconsumed over theories to account for it. Some have conjectured hastily that\nall Southerners in town hie themselves to caf\u00c3\u00a9s at nightfall. This applause of\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009crebel\u00e2\u0080\u009d air in a Northern city does puzzle a little; but it is\nnot insolvable. The war with Spain, many years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 generous mint and\nwatermelon crops, a few long-shot winners at the New Orleans race-track, and\nthe brilliant banquets given by the Indiana and Kansas citizens who compose the\nNorth Carolina Society have made the South rather a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfad\u00e2\u0080\u009d in\nManhattan. Your manicure will lisp softly that your left forefinger reminds her\nso much of a gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in Richmond, Va. Oh, certainly; but many a lady\nhas to work now\u00e2\u0080\u0094the war, you know.\n\n\nWhen \u00e2\u0080\u009cDixie\u00e2\u0080\u009d was being played a dark-haired young man sprang up\nfrom somewhere with a Mosby guerrilla yell and waved frantically his\nsoft-brimmed hat. Then he strayed through the smoke, dropped into the vacant\nchair at our table and pulled out cigarettes.\n\n\nThe evening was at the period when reserve is thawed. One of us mentioned three\nW\u00c3\u00bcrzburgers to the waiter; the dark-haired young man acknowledged his inclusion\nin the order by a smile and a nod. I hastened to ask him a question because I\nwanted to try out a theory I had.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you mind telling me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether you are\nfrom\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe fist of E. Rushmore Coglan banged the table and I was jarred into silence.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExcuse me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question I never\nlike to hear asked. What does it matter where a man is from? Is it fair to\njudge a man by his post-office address? Why, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen Kentuckians who\nhated whiskey, Virginians who weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t descended from Pocahontas,\nIndianians who hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t written a novel, Mexicans who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wear\nvelvet trousers with silver dollars sewed along the seams, funny Englishmen,\nspendthrift Yankees, cold-blooded Southerners, narrow-minded Westerners, and\nNew Yorkers who were too busy to stop for an hour on the street to watch a\none-armed grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clerk do up cranberries in paper bags. Let a man be a\nman and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handicap him with the label of any section.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPardon me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut my curiosity was not altogether an\nidle one. I know the South, and when the band plays \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dixie\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I like\nto observe. I have formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with\nspecial violence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of\neither Secaucus, N.J., or the district between Murray Hill Lyceum and the\nHarlem River, this city. I was about to put my opinion to the test by inquiring\nof this gentleman when you interrupted with your own\u00e2\u0080\u0094larger theory, I\nmust confess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nAnd now the dark-haired young man spoke to me, and it became evident that his\nmind also moved along its own set of grooves.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to be a periwinkle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, mysteriously,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009con the top of a valley, and sing tooralloo-ralloo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThis was clearly too obscure, so I turned again to Coglan.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been around the world twelve times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nknow an Esquimau in Upernavik who sends to Cincinnati for his neckties, and I\nsaw a goat-herder in Uruguay who won a prize in a Battle Creek breakfast food\npuzzle competition. I pay rent on a room in Cairo, Egypt, and another in\nYokohama all the year around. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got slippers waiting for me in a\ntea-house in Shanghai, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to tell \u00e2\u0080\u0099em how to cook my\neggs in Rio de Janeiro or Seattle. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mighty little old world.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the use of bragging about being from the North, or the South, or\nthe old manor house in the dale, or Euclid avenue, Cleveland, or Pike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nPeak, or Fairfax County, Va., or Hooligan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Flats or any place?\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a better world when we quit being fools about some mildewed town\nor ten acres of swampland just because we happened to be born there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou seem to be a genuine cosmopolite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said admiringly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it also seems that you would decry patriotism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA relic of the stone age,\u00e2\u0080\u009d declared Coglan, warmly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are\nall brothers\u00e2\u0080\u0094Chinamen, Englishmen, Zulus, Patagonians and the people in\nthe bend of the Kaw River. Some day all this petty pride in one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s city or\nState or section or country will be wiped out, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all be citizens\nof the world, as we ought to be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut while you are wandering in foreign lands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I persisted,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not your thoughts revert to some spot\u00e2\u0080\u0094some dear\nand\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNary a spot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted E. R. Coglan, flippantly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nterrestrial, globular, planetary hunk of matter, slightly flattened at the\npoles, and known as the Earth, is my abode. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve met a good many\nobject-bound citizens of this country abroad. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen men from Chicago\nsit in a gondola in Venice on a moonlight night and brag about their drainage\ncanal. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a Southerner on being introduced to the King of England\nhand that monarch, without batting his eyes, the information that his\ngrand-aunt on his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side was related by marriage to the Perkinses,\nof Charleston. I knew a New Yorker who was kidnapped for ransom by some\nAfghanistan bandits. His people sent over the money and he came back to Kabul\nwith the agent. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Afghanistan?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the natives said to him through an\ninterpreter. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, not so slow, do you think?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says he, and he begins to tell them about a cab driver\nat Sixth avenue and Broadway. Those ideas don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suit me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not\ntied down to anything that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t 8,000 miles in diameter. Just put me\ndown as E. Rushmore Coglan, citizen of the terrestrial sphere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMy cosmopolite made a large adieu and left me, for he thought he saw some one\nthrough the chatter and smoke whom he knew. So I was left with the would-be\nperiwinkle, who was reduced to W\u00c3\u00bcrzburger without further ability to voice his\naspirations to perch, melodious, upon the summit of a valley.\n\n\nI sat reflecting upon my evident cosmopolite and wondering how the poet had\nmanaged to miss him. He was my discovery and I believed in him. How was it?\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe men that breed from them they traffic up and down, but cling to\ntheir cities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hem as a child to the mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nNot so E. Rushmore Coglan. With the whole world for his\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\nMy meditations were interrupted by a tremendous noise and conflict in another\npart of the caf\u00c3\u00a9. I saw above the heads of the seated patrons E. Rushmore\nCoglan and a stranger to me engaged in terrific battle. They fought between the\ntables like Titans, and glasses crashed, and men caught their hats up and were\nknocked down, and a brunette screamed, and a blonde began to sing\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTeasing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMy cosmopolite was sustaining the pride and reputation of the Earth when the\nwaiters closed in on both combatants with their famous flying wedge formation\nand bore them outside, still resisting.\n\n\nI called McCarthy, one of the French gar\u00c3\u00a7ons, and asked him the\ncause of the conflict.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe man with the red tie\u00e2\u0080\u009d (that was my cosmopolite), said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cgot hot on account of things said about the bum sidewalks and water\nsupply of the place he come from by the other guy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, bewildered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat man is a citizen of the\nworld\u00e2\u0080\u0094a cosmopolite. He\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOriginally from Mattawamkeag, Maine, he said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued McCarthy,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand for no knockin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n",
