    "name": "OHenry - Man About Town",
    "body": "\nThere were two or three things that I wanted to know. I do not care about a\nmystery. So I began to inquire.\n\n\nIt took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases. And then\nI began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces. This serious query was at\nfirst received with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum. I was at\nlast assured that its double form of construction was designed to make lighter\nthe burden of woman, who makes up beds. I was so foolish as to persist, begging\nto know why, then, they were not made in two equal pieces; whereupon I was\nshunned.\n\n\nThe third draught that I craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment\nconcerning the character known as A Man About Town. He was more vague in my\nmind than a type should be. We must have a concrete idea of anything, even if\nit be an imaginary idea, before we can comprehend it. Now, I have a mental\npicture of John Doe that is as clear as a steel engraving. His eyes are weak\nblue; he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat. He stands always in\nthe sunshine chewing something; and he keeps half-shutting his pocket knife and\nopening it again with his thumb. And, if the Man Higher Up is ever found, take\nmy assurance for it, he will be a large, pale man with blue wristlets showing\nunder his cuffs, and he will be sitting to have his shoes polished within sound\nof a bowling alley, and there will be somewhere about him turquoises.\n\n\nBut the canvas of my imagination, when it came to limning the Man About Town,\nwas blank. I fancied that he had a detachable sneer (like the smile of the\nCheshire cat) and attached cuffs; and that was all. Whereupon I asked a\nnewspaper reporter about him.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca \u00e2\u0080\u0098Man About Town\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is something\nbetween a \u00e2\u0080\u0098rounder\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and a \u00e2\u0080\u0098clubman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nexactly\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, he fits in between Mrs. Fish\u00e2\u0080\u0099s receptions and private\nboxing bouts. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t belong either to\nthe Lotos Club or to the Jerry McGeogheghan Galvanised Iron Workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nApprentices\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Left Hook Chowder Association. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly know\nhow to describe him to you. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see him everywhere there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nanything doing. Yes, I suppose he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a type. Dress clothes every evening;\nknows the ropes; calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names.\nNo; he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives. You generally see him alone\nor with another man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMy friend the reporter left me, and I wandered further afield. By this time the\n3126 electric lights on the Rialto were alight. People passed, but they held me\nnot. Paphian eyes rayed upon me, and left me unscathed. Diners, heimgangers,\nshop-girls, confidence men, panhandlers, actors, highwaymen, millionaires and\noutlanders hurried, skipped, strolled, sneaked, swaggered and scurried by me;\nbut I took no note of them. I knew them all; I had read their hearts; they had\nserved. I wanted my Man About Town. He was a type, and to drop him would be an\nerror\u00e2\u0080\u0094a typograph\u00e2\u0080\u0094but no! let us continue.\n\n\nLet us continue with a moral digression. To see a family reading the Sunday\npaper gratifies. The sections have been separated. Papa is earnestly scanning\nthe page that pictures the young lady exercising before an open window, and\nbending\u00e2\u0080\u0094but there, there! Mamma is interested in trying to guess the\nmissing letters in the word N_w Yo_k. The oldest girls are eagerly perusing the\nfinancial reports, for a certain young man remarked last Sunday night that he\nhad taken a flyer in Q., X. & Z. Willie, the eighteen-year-old son, who\nattends the New York public school, is absorbed in the weekly article\ndescribing how to make over an old skirt, for he hopes to take a prize in\nsewing on graduation day.\n\n\nGrandma is holding to the comic supplement with a two-hours\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grip; and\nlittle Tottie, the baby, is rocking along the best she can with the real estate\ntransfers. This view is intended to be reassuring, for it is desirable that a\nfew lines of this story be skipped. For it introduces strong drink.\n\n\nI went into a caf\u00c3\u00a9 to\u00e2\u0080\u0094and while it was being mixed I asked the man who\ngrabs up your hot Scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what he understood by\nthe term, epithet, description, designation, characterisation or appellation,\nviz.: a \u00e2\u0080\u009cMan About Town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, carefully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit means a fly guy that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwise to the all-night push\u00e2\u0080\u0094see? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hot sport that you\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bump to the rail anywhere between the Flatirons\u00e2\u0080\u0094see? I guess\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about what it means.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nI thanked him and departed.\n\n\nOn the sidewalk a Salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle gently\nagainst my waistcoat pocket.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you mind telling me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you ever meet\nwith the character commonly denominated as \u00e2\u0080\u0098A Man About Town\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nduring your daily wanderings?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I know whom you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, with a gentle smile.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe see them in the same places night after night. They are the\ndevil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body guard, and if the soldiers of any army are as faithful as\nthey are, their commanders are well served. We go among them, diverting a few\npennies from their wickedness to the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nShe shook the box again and I dropped a dime into it.\n\n\nIn front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine, a critic, was climbing from a\ncab. He seemed at leisure; and I put my question to him. He answered me\nconscientiously, as I was sure he would.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a type of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Man About Town\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in New York,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nanswered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe term is quite familiar to me, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\nwas ever called upon to define the character before. It would be difficult to\npoint you out an exact specimen. I would say, offhand, that it is a man who had\na hopeless case of the peculiar New York disease of wanting to see and know. At\n6 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock each day life begins with him. He follows rigidly the\nconventions of dress and manners; but in the business of poking his nose into\nplaces where he does not belong he could give pointers to a civet cat or a\njackdaw. He is the man who has chased Bohemia about the town from rathskeller\nto roof garden and from Hester street to Harlem until you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a\nplace in the city where they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cut their spaghetti with a knife. Your\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Man About Town\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has done that. He is always on the scent of\nsomething new. He is curiosity, impudence and omnipresence. Hansoms were made\nfor him, and gold-banded cigars; and the curse of music at dinner. There are\nnot so many of him; but his minority report is adopted everywhere.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad you brought up the subject; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve felt the influence\nof this nocturnal blight upon our city, but I never thought to analyse it\nbefore. I can see now that your \u00e2\u0080\u0098Man About Town\u00e2\u0080\u0099 should have been\nclassified long ago. In his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models; and\nthe orchestra plays \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s All Go Up to Maud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for\nhim, by request, instead of H\u00c3\u00a4ndel. He makes his rounds every evening;\nwhile you and I see the elephant once a week. When the cigar store is raided,\nhe winks at the officer, familiar with his ground, and walks away immune, while\nyou and I search among the Presidents for names, and among the stars for\naddresses to give the desk sergeant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMy friend, the critic, paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence. I seized\nmy advantage.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have classified him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried with joy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have\npainted his portrait in the gallery of city types. But I must meet one face to\nface. I must study the Man About Town at first hand. Where shall I find him?\nHow shall I know him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nWithout seeming to hear me, the critic went on. And his cab-driver was waiting\nfor his fare, too.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is the sublimated essence of Butt-in; the refined, intrinsic extract\nof Rubber; the concentrated, purified, irrefutable, unavoidable spirit of\nCuriosity and Inquisitiveness. A new sensation is the breath in his nostrils;\nwhen his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with the\nindefatigability of a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExcuse me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut can you produce one of this\ntype? It is a new thing to me. I must study it. I will search the town over\nuntil I find one. Its habitat must be here on Broadway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am about to dine here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my friend. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome inside, and\nif there is a Man About Town present I will point him out to you. I know most\nof the regular patrons here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not dining yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will excuse me. I\nam going to find my Man About Town this night if I have to rake New York from\nthe Battery to Little Coney Island.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nI left the hotel and walked down Broadway. The pursuit of my type gave a\npleasant savour of life and interest to the air I breathed. I was glad to be in\na city so great, so complex and diversified. Leisurely and with something of an\nair I strolled along with my heart expanding at the thought that I was a\ncitizen of great Gotham, a sharer in its magnificence and pleasures, a partaker\nin its glory and prestige.\n\n\nI turned to cross the street. I heard something buzz like a bee, and then I\ntook a long, pleasant ride with Santos-Dumont.\n\n\nWhen I opened my eyes I remembered a smell of gasoline, and I said aloud:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it passed yet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nA hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that\nwas not at all fevered. A young doctor came along, grinned, and handed me a\nmorning newspaper.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWant to see how it happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked cheerily. I read the\narticle. Its headlines began where I heard the buzzing leave off the night\nbefore. It closed with these lines:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bellevue Hospital, where it was said that his injuries were not\nserious. He appeared to be a typical Man About Town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n",
