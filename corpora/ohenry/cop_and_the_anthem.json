    "body": "\nOn his bench in Madison Square Soapy moved uneasily. When wild geese honk high\nof nights, and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands,\nand when Soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park, you may know that\nwinter is near at hand.\n\n\nA dead leaf fell in Soapy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lap. That was Jack Frost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s card. Jack\nis kind to the regular denizens of Madison Square, and gives fair warning of\nhis annual call. At the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the\nNorth Wind, footman of the mansion of All Outdoors, so that the inhabitants\nthereof may make ready.\n\n\nSoapy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him\nto resolve himself into a singular Committee of Ways and Means to provide\nagainst the coming rigour. And therefore he moved uneasily on his bench.\n\n\nThe hibernatorial ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest. In them there\nwere no considerations of Mediterranean cruises, of soporific Southern skies\ndrifting in the Vesuvian Bay. Three months on the Island was what his soul\ncraved. Three months of assured board and bed and congenial company, safe from\nBoreas and bluecoats, seemed to Soapy the essence of things desirable.\n\n\nFor years the hospitable Blackwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had been his winter quarters. Just\nas his more fortunate fellow New Yorkers had bought their tickets to Palm Beach\nand the Riviera each winter, so Soapy had made his humble arrangements for his\nannual hegira to the Island. And now the time was come. On the previous night\nthree Sabbath newspapers, distributed beneath his coat, about his ankles and\nover his lap, had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the\nspurting fountain in the ancient square. So the Island loomed big and timely in\nSoapy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind. He scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for\nthe city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dependents. In Soapy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion the Law was more benign\nthan Philanthropy. There was an endless round of institutions, municipal and\neleemosynary, on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant\nwith the simple life. But to one of Soapy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proud spirit the gifts of\ncharity are encumbered. If not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit\nfor every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy. As Caesar had his\nBrutus, every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath, every loaf of bread\nits compensation of a private and personal inquisition. Wherefore it is better\nto be a guest of the law, which though conducted by rules, does not meddle\nunduly with a gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private affairs.\n\n\nSoapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about accomplishing his\ndesire. There were many easy ways of doing this. The pleasantest was to dine\nluxuriously at some expensive restaurant; and then, after declaring insolvency,\nbe handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman. An accommodating\nmagistrate would do the rest.\n\n\nSoapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of\nasphalt, where Broadway and Fifth Avenue flow together. Up Broadway he turned,\nand halted at a glittering caf\u00c3\u00a9, where are gathered together nightly the\nchoicest products of the grape, the silkworm and the protoplasm.\n\n\nSoapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward. He\nwas shaven, and his coat was decent and his neat black, ready-tied four-in-hand\nhad been presented to him by a lady missionary on Thanksgiving Day. If he could\nreach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his. The portion\nof him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the\nwaiter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind. A roasted mallard duck, thought Soapy, would be about the\nthing\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a bottle of Chablis, and then Camembert, a demi-tasse and a\ncigar. One dollar for the cigar would be enough. The total would not be so high\nas to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the caf\u00c3\u00a9 management;\nand yet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter\nrefuge.\n\n\nBut as Soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye\nfell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes. Strong and ready hands turned\nhim about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the\nignoble fate of the menaced mallard.\n\n\nSoapy turned off Broadway. It seemed that his route to the coveted island was\nnot to be an epicurean one. Some other way of entering limbo must be thought\nof.\n\n\nAt a corner of Sixth Avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares\nbehind plate-glass made a shop window conspicuous. Soapy took a cobblestone and\ndashed it through the glass. People came running around the corner, a policeman\nin the lead. Soapy stood still, with his hands in his pockets, and smiled at\nthe sight of brass buttons.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the man that done that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d inquired the officer\nexcitedly.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you figure out that I might have had something to do with\nit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Soapy, not without sarcasm, but friendly, as one greets good\nfortune.\n\n\nThe policeman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind refused to accept Soapy even as a clue. Men who\nsmash windows do not remain to parley with the law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minions. They take\nto their heels. The policeman saw a man half way down the block running to\ncatch a car. With drawn club he joined in the pursuit. Soapy, with disgust in\nhis heart, loafed along, twice unsuccessful.\n\n\nOn the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions. It\ncatered to large appetites and modest purses. Its crockery and atmosphere were\nthick; its soup and napery thin. Into this place Soapy took his accusive shoes\nand telltale trousers without challenge. At a table he sat and consumed\nbeefsteak, flapjacks, doughnuts and pie. And then to the waiter be betrayed the\nfact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, get busy and call a cop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Soapy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nkeep a gentleman waiting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo cop for youse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the waiter, with a voice like butter cakes\nand an eye like the cherry in a Manhattan cocktail. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, Con!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nNeatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched Soapy. He\narose, joint by joint, as a carpenter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rule opens, and beat the dust\nfrom his clothes. Arrest seemed but a rosy dream. The Island seemed very far\naway. A policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and\nwalked down the street.\n\n\nFive blocks Soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture\nagain. This time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself\na \u00e2\u0080\u009ccinch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was\nstanding before a show window gazing with sprightly interest at its display of\nshaving mugs and inkstands, and two yards from the window a large policeman of\nsevere demeanour leaned against a water plug.\n\n\nIt was Soapy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cmasher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the\ncontiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he would\nsoon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would insure his\nwinter quarters on the right little, tight little isle.\n\n\nSoapy straightened the lady missionary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ready-made tie, dragged his\nshrinking cuffs into the open, set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward\nthe young woman. He made eyes at her, was taken with sudden coughs and\n\u00e2\u0080\u009chems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d smiled, smirked and went brazenly through the impudent and\ncontemptible litany of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmasher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With half an eye Soapy saw\nthat the policeman was watching him fixedly. The young woman moved away a few\nsteps, and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs. Soapy\nfollowed, boldly stepping to her side, raised his hat and said:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh there, Bedelia! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you want to come and play in my\nyard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe policeman was still looking. The persecuted young woman had but to beckon a\nfinger and Soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven. Already\nhe imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the station-house. The young woman\nfaced him and, stretching out a hand, caught Soapy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat sleeve.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, Mike,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said joyfully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll blow me to\na pail of suds. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have spoke to you sooner, but the cop was\nwatching.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nWith the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak Soapy walked past the\npoliceman overcome with gloom. He seemed doomed to liberty.\n\n\nAt the next corner he shook off his companion and ran. He halted in the\ndistrict where by night are found the lightest streets, hearts, vows and\nlibrettos. Women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air. A\nsudden fear seized Soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune\nto arrest. The thought brought a little of panic upon it, and when he came upon\nanother policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he\ncaught at the immediate straw of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisorderly conduct.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nOn the sidewalk Soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh\nvoice. He danced, howled, raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin.\n\n\nThe policeman twirled his club, turned his back to Soapy and remarked to a\ncitizen.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis one of them Yale lads celebratin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the goose egg they\ngive to the Hartford College. Noisy; but no harm. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve instructions to\nlave them be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nDisconsolate, Soapy ceased his unavailing racket. Would never a policeman lay\nhands on him? In his fancy the Island seemed an unattainable Arcadia. He\nbuttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind.\n\n\nIn a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging\nlight. His silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering. Soapy stepped\ninside, secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly. The man at the\ncigar light followed hastily.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy umbrella,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, sternly.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d sneered Soapy, adding insult to petit larceny.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you call a policeman? I took it. Your umbrella!\nWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you call a cop? There stands one on the corner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise, with a presentiment\nthat luck would again run against him. The policeman looked at the two\ncuriously.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the umbrella man\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is\u00e2\u0080\u0094well,\nyou know how these mistakes occur\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0094if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your umbrella I\nhope you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll excuse me\u00e2\u0080\u0094I picked it up this morning in a\nrestaurant\u00e2\u0080\u0094If you recognise it as yours, why\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hope\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Soapy, viciously.\n\n\nThe ex-umbrella man retreated. The policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in\nan opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching\ntwo blocks away.\n\n\nSoapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements. He hurled the\numbrella wrathfully into an excavation. He muttered against the men who wear\nhelmets and carry clubs. Because he wanted to fall into their clutches, they\nseemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong.\n\n\nAt length Soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and\nturmoil was but faint. He set his face down this toward Madison Square, for the\nhoming instinct survives even when the home is a park bench.\n\n\nBut on an unusually quiet corner Soapy came to a standstill. Here was an old\nchurch, quaint and rambling and gabled. Through one violet-stained window a\nsoft light glowed, where, no doubt, the organist loitered over the keys, making\nsure of his mastery of the coming Sabbath anthem. For there drifted out to\nSoapy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the\nconvolutions of the iron fence.\n\n\nThe moon was above, lustrous and serene; vehicles and pedestrians were few;\nsparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves\u00e2\u0080\u0094for a little while the scene\nmight have been a country churchyard. And the anthem that the organist played\ncemented Soapy to the iron fence, for he had known it well in the days when his\nlife contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and\nimmaculate thoughts and collars.\n\n\nThe conjunction of Soapy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s receptive state of mind and the influences\nabout the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul. He\nviewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled, the degraded days,\nunworthy desires, dead hopes, wrecked faculties and base motives that made up\nhis existence.\n\n\nAnd also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood. An\ninstantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate.\nHe would pull himself out of the mire; he would make a man of himself again; he\nwould conquer the evil that had taken possession of him. There was time; he was\ncomparatively young yet; he would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue\nthem without faltering. Those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a\nrevolution in him. To-morrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and\nfind work. A fur importer had once offered him a place as driver. He would find\nhim to-morrow and ask for the position. He would be somebody in the world. He\nwould\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\nSoapy felt a hand laid on his arm. He looked quickly around into the broad face\nof a policeman.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the officer.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Soapy.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen come along,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the policeman.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThree months on the Island,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Magistrate in the Police\nCourt the next morning.\n",
