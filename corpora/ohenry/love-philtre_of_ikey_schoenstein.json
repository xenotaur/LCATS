    "name": "OHenry - the Love-philtre Of Ikey Schoenstein",
    "body": "\nThe Blue Light Drug Store is downtown, between the Bowery and First Avenue,\nwhere the distance between the two streets is the shortest. The Blue Light does\nnot consider that pharmacy is a thing of bric-a-brac, scent and ice-cream soda.\nIf you ask it for pain-killer it will not give you a bonbon.\n\n\nThe Blue Light scorns the labour-saving arts of modern pharmacy. It macerates\nits opium and percolates its own laudanum and paregoric. To this day pills are\nmade behind its tall prescription desk\u00e2\u0080\u0094pills rolled out on its own\npill-tile, divided with a spatula, rolled with the finger and thumb, dusted\nwith calcined magnesia and delivered in little round pasteboard pill-boxes. The\nstore is on a corner about which coveys of ragged-plumed, hilarious children\nplay and become candidates for the cough drops and soothing syrups that wait\nfor them inside.\n\n\nIkey Schoenstein was the night clerk of the Blue Light and the friend of his\ncustomers. Thus it is on the East Side, where the heart of pharmacy is not\nglac\u00c3\u00a9. There, as it should be, the druggist is a counsellor, a\nconfessor, an adviser, an able and willing missionary and mentor whose learning\nis respected, whose occult wisdom is venerated and whose medicine is often\npoured, untasted, into the gutter. Therefore Ikey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corniform,\nbe-spectacled nose and narrow, knowledge-bowed figure was well known in the\nvicinity of the Blue Light, and his advice and notice were much desired.\n\n\nIkey roomed and breakfasted at Mrs. Riddle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two squares away. Mrs.\nRiddle had a daughter named Rosy. The circumlocution has been in vain\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\nmust have guessed it\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ikey adored Rosy. She tinctured all his thoughts;\nshe was the compound extract of all that was chemically pure and\nofficinal\u00e2\u0080\u0094the dispensatory contained nothing equal to her. But Ikey was\ntimid, and his hopes remained insoluble in the menstruum of his backwardness\nand fears. Behind his counter he was a superior being, calmly conscious of\nspecial knowledge and worth; outside he was a weak-kneed, purblind,\nmotorman-cursed rambler, with ill-fitting clothes stained with chemicals and\nsmelling of socotrine aloes and valerianate of ammonia.\n\n\nThe fly in Ikey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ointment (thrice welcome, pat trope!) was Chunk\nMcGowan.\n\n\nMr. McGowan was also striving to catch the bright smiles tossed about by Rosy.\nBut he was no outfielder as Ikey was; he picked them off the bat. At the same\ntime he was Ikey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend and customer, and often dropped in at the Blue\nLight Drug Store to have a bruise painted with iodine or get a cut\nrubber-plastered after a pleasant evening spent along the Bowery.\n\n\nOne afternoon McGowan drifted in in his silent, easy way, and sat, comely,\nsmooth-faced, hard, indomitable, good-natured, upon a stool.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIkey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, when his friend had fetched his mortar and sat\nopposite, grinding gum benzoin to a powder, \u00e2\u0080\u009cget busy with your ear.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drugs for me if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the line I need.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nIkey scanned the countenance of Mr. McGowan for the usual evidences of\nconflict, but found none.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake your coat off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he ordered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess already that you\nhave been stuck in the ribs with a knife. I have many times told you those\nDagoes would do you up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nMr. McGowan smiled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot any Dagoes. But\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve located the diagnosis all right enough\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s under my\ncoat, near the ribs. Say! Ikey\u00e2\u0080\u0094Rosy and me are goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to run away\nand get married to-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nIkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left forefinger was doubled over the edge of the mortar, holding\nit steady. He gave it a wild rap with the pestle, but felt it not. Meanwhile\nMr. McGowan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile faded to a look of perplexed gloom.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif she keeps in the notion until\nthe time comes. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been layin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pipes for the getaway for two\nweeks. One day she says she will; the same evenin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she says nixy.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve agreed on to-night, and Rosy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stuck to the affirmative this\ntime for two whole days. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five hours yet till the time, and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stand me up when it comes to the scratch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou said you wanted drugs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d remarked Ikey.\n\n\nMr. McGowan looked ill at ease and harassed\u00e2\u0080\u0094a condition opposed to his\nusual line of demeanour. He made a patent-medicine almanac into a roll and\nfitted it with unprofitable carefulness about his finger.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have this double handicap make a false start to-night\nfor a million,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a little flat up in Harlem\nall ready, with chrysanthemums on the table and a kettle ready to boil. And\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve engaged a pulpit pounder to be ready at his house for us at 9.30.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to come off. And if Rosy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change her mind\nagain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mr. McGowan ceased, a prey to his doubts.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see then yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ikey, shortly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat makes\nit that you talk of drugs, or what I can be doing about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOld man Riddle don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like me a little bit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d went on the\nuneasy suitor, bent upon marshalling his arguments. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor a week he\nhasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let Rosy step outside the door with me. If it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for\nlosin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a boarder they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have bounced me long ago. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nmakin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 $20 a week and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never regret flyin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the coop\nwith Chunk McGowan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will excuse me, Chunk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ikey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must make a\nprescription that is to be called for soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said McGowan, looking up suddenly, \u00e2\u0080\u009csay, Ikey,\nain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there a drug of some kind\u00e2\u0080\u0094some kind of powders that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nmake a girl like you better if you give \u00e2\u0080\u0099em to her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nIkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lip beneath his nose curled with the scorn of superior\nenlightenment; but before he could answer, McGowan continued:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTim Lacy told me he got some once from a croaker uptown and fed\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099em to his girl in soda water. From the very first dose he was ace-high\nand everybody else looked like thirty cents to her. They was married in less\nthan two weeks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nStrong and simple was Chunk McGowan. A better reader of men than Ikey was could\nhave seen that his tough frame was strung upon fine wires. Like a good general\nwho was about to invade the enemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territory he was seeking to guard\nevery point against possible failure.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d went on Chunk hopefully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if I had one of\nthem powders to give Rosy when I see her at supper to-night it might brace her\nup and keep her from reneging on the proposition to skip. I guess she\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need a mule team to drag her away, but women are better at coaching\nthan they are at running bases. If the stuff\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work just for a couple of\nhours it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do the trick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen is this foolishness of running away to be happening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked\nIkey.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. McGowan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSupper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at\nseven. At eight Rosy goes to bed with a headache. At nine old Parvenzano lets\nme through to his back yard, where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a board off Riddle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfence, next door. I go under her window and help her down the fire-escape.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to make it early on the preacher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall dead easy if Rosy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t balk when the flag drops. Can you fix me one\nof them powders, Ikey?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nIkey Schoenstein rubbed his nose slowly.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChunk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is of drugs of that nature that\npharmaceutists must have much carefulness. To you alone of my acquaintance\nwould I intrust a powder like that. But for you I shall make it, and you shall\nsee how it makes Rosy to think of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nIkey went behind the prescription desk. There he crushed to a powder two\nsoluble tablets, each containing a quarter of a grain of morphia. To them he\nadded a little sugar of milk to increase the bulk, and folded the mixture\nneatly in a white paper. Taken by an adult this powder would insure several\nhours of heavy slumber without danger to the sleeper. This he handed to Chunk\nMcGowan, telling him to administer it in a liquid if possible, and received the\nhearty thanks of the backyard Lochinvar.\n\n\nThe subtlety of Ikey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action becomes apparent upon recital of his\nsubsequent move. He sent a messenger for Mr. Riddle and disclosed the plans of\nMr. McGowan for eloping with Rosy. Mr. Riddle was a stout man, brick-dusty of\ncomplexion and sudden in action.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch obliged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, briefly, to Ikey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lazy Irish\nloafer! My own room\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just above Rosy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just go up\nthere myself after supper and load the shot-gun and wait. If he comes in my\nback yard he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go away in a ambulance instead of a bridal chaise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nWith Rosy held in the clutches of Morpheus for a many-hours deep slumber, and\nthe bloodthirsty parent waiting, armed and forewarned, Ikey felt that his rival\nwas close, indeed, upon discomfiture.\n\n\nAll night in the Blue Light Drug Store he waited at his duties for chance news\nof the tragedy, but none came.\n\n\nAt eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the morning the day clerk arrived and Ikey started\nhurriedly for Mrs. Riddle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to learn the outcome. And, lo! as he stepped\nout of the store who but Chunk McGowan sprang from a passing street car and\ngrasped his hand\u00e2\u0080\u0094Chunk McGowan with a victor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile and flushed\nwith joy.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPulled it off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chunk with Elysium in his grin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRosy\nhit the fire-escape on time to a second, and we was under the wire at the\nReverend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at 9.30\u00c2\u00bc. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up at the flat\u00e2\u0080\u0094she cooked\neggs this mornin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in a blue kimono\u00e2\u0080\u0094Lord! how lucky I am! You must\npace up some day, Ikey, and feed with us. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a job down near the\nbridge, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m heading for now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\u00e2\u0080\u0094powder?\u00e2\u0080\u009d stammered Ikey.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that stuff you gave me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chunk, broadening his grin;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwell, it was this way. I sat down at the supper table last night at\nRiddle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and I looked at Rosy, and I says to myself, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Chunk, if\nyou get the girl get her on the square\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try any hocus-pocus\nwith a thoroughbred like her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And I keeps the paper you give me in my\npocket. And then my lamps fall on another party present, who, I says to myself,\nis failin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in a proper affection toward his comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 son-in-law, so I\nwatches my chance and dumps that powder in old man Riddle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncoffee\u00e2\u0080\u0094see?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n",
