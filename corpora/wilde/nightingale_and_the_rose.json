I have read all that the wise\nmen have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet\nfor want of a red rose is my life made wretched.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere at last is a true lover,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nNightingale. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNight after night have I sung of him,\nthough I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to\nthe stars, and now I see him. His hair is dark as the\nhyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire;\nbut passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set\nher seal upon his brow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nmurmured the young Student, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand my love will be of the\ncompany. If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me\ntill dawn. If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in\nmy arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her\nhand will be clasped in mine. But there is no red rose in\nmy garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.\nShe will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere indeed is the true lover,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nNightingale. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I sing of, he suffers\u00e2\u0080\u0094what\nis joy to me, to him is pain. Surely Love is a wonderful\nthing. It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than\nfine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is\nit set forth in the marketplace. It may not be purchased of\nthe merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for\ngold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe musicians will sit in their gallery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe young Student, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand play upon their stringed\ninstruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and\nthe violin. She will dance so lightly that her feet will\nnot touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will\nthrong round her. But with me she will not dance, for I\nhave no red rose to give her\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and he flung himself down on\nthe grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy is he weeping?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked a little Green Lizard,\nas he ran past him with his tail in the air.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, indeed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a Butterfly, who was\nfluttering about after a sunbeam.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, indeed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered a Daisy to his neighbour,\nin a soft, low voice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is weeping for a red rose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nNightingale.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor a red rose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d they cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow very\nridiculous!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the little Lizard, who was something of a\ncynic, laughed outright.\nBut the Nightingale understood the secret of the\nStudent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and\nthought about the mystery of Love.\nSuddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared\ninto the air. She passed through the grove like a shadow,\nand like a shadow she sailed across the garden.\nIn the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful\nRose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon\na spray.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me a red rose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will\nsing you my sweetest song.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy roses are white,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cas white\nas the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the\nmountain. But go to my brother who grows round the old\nsun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing\nround the old sun-dial.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me a red rose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will\nsing you my sweetest song.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy roses are yellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cas\nyellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber\nthrone, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow\nbefore the mower comes with his scythe. But go to my\nbrother who grows beneath the Student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window, and perhaps\nhe will give you what you want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing\nbeneath the Student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me a red rose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will\nsing you my sweetest song.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy roses are red,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas red as\nthe feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral\nthat wave and wave in the ocean-cavern. But the winter has\nchilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm\nhas broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this\nyear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne red rose is all I want,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the\nNightingale, \u00e2\u0080\u009conly one red rose! Is there no way by\nwhich I can get it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Tree; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it\nis so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell it to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Nightingale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nnot afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you want a red rose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Tree,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it\nwith your own heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-blood. You must sing to me with\nyour breast against a thorn. All night long you must sing\nto me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood\nmust flow into my veins, and become mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeath is a great price to pay for a red rose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\ncried the Nightingale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Life is very dear to all.\nIt is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in\nhis chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.\nSweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells\nthat hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the\nhill. Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart\nof a bird compared to the heart of a man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSo she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the\nair. She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a\nshadow she sailed through the grove.\nThe young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had\nleft him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful\neyes.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe happy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Nightingale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe\nhappy; you shall have your red rose. I will build it out of\nmusic by moonlight, and stain it with my own\nheart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-blood. All that I ask of you in return is\nthat you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy,\nthough she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is\nmighty. Flame-coloured are his wings, and coloured like\nflame is his body. His lips are sweet as honey, and his\nbreath is like frankincense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he\ncould not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for\nhe only knew the things that are written down in books.\nBut the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very\nfond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his\nbranches.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSing me one last song,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nshall feel very lonely when you are gone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSo the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was\nlike water bubbling from a silver jar.\nWhen she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled\na note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has form,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself, as he walked\naway through the grove\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat cannot be denied to her;\nbut has she got feeling? I am afraid not. In fact,\nshe is like most artists; she is all style, without any\nsincerity. She would not sacrifice herself for\nothers. She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows\nthat the arts are selfish. Still, it must be admitted that\nshe has some beautiful notes in her voice. What a pity it\nis that they do not mean anything, or do any practical\ngood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he went into his room, and lay down on his\nlittle pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a\ntime, he fell asleep.\nAnd when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to\nthe Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn. All\nnight long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the\ncold crystal Moon leaned down and listened. All night long\nshe sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast,\nand her life-blood ebbed away from her.\nShe sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and\na girl. And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there\nblossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song\nfollowed song. Pale was it, at first, as the mist that\nhangs over the river\u00e2\u0080\u0094pale as the feet of the morning, and\nsilver as the wings of the dawn. As the shadow of a rose in\na mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so\nwas the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.\nBut the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against\nthe thorn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPress closer, little Nightingale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\ncried the Tree, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor the Day will come before the rose is\nfinished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and\nlouder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of\npassion in the soul of a man and a maid.\nAnd a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose,\nlike the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the\nlips of the bride. But the thorn had not yet reached her\nheart, so the rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart remained white, for only a\nNightingale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-blood can crimson the heart of\na rose.\nAnd the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against\nthe thorn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPress closer, little Nightingale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\ncried the Tree, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor the Day will come before the rose is\nfinished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the\nthorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through\nher. Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder\ngrew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by\nDeath, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.\nAnd the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the\neastern sky. Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson\nas a ruby was the heart.\nBut the Nightingale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice grew fainter, and her little\nwings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes. Fainter\nand fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in\nher throat.\nThen she gave one last burst of music. The white Moon\nheard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the\nsky. The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with\necstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.\nEcho bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the\nsleeping shepherds from their dreams. It floated through\nthe reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the\nsea.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Tree, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe rose is\nfinished now\u00e2\u0080\u009d; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she\nwas lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her\nheart.\nAnd at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what a wonderful piece of luck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009chere is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like\nit in all my life. It is so beautiful that I am sure it has\na long Latin name\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and he leaned down and plucked it.\nThen he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhouse with the rose in his hand.\nThe daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway\nwinding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her\nfeet.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou said that you would dance with me if I brought you\na red rose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Student. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is the\nreddest rose in all the world. You will wear it to-night\nnext your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I\nlove you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut the girl frowned.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid it will not go with my dress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nanswered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, besides, the Chamberlain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nephew has\nsent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost\nfar more than flowers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street,\nwhere it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUngrateful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell\nyou what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you?\nOnly a Student. Why, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe you have even\ngot silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnephew has\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and she got up from her chair and went into\nthe house.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a silly thing Love is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Student\nas he walked away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not half as useful as\nLogic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling\none of things that are not going to happen, and making one\nbelieve things that are not true. In fact, it is quite\nunpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I\nshall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSo he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book,\nand began to read.\n\n\n\n",
