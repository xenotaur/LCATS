Over his head was a bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head,\nstuffed by a Madrid taxidermist; on the walls\nwere framed photographs and bull-fight posters.\nThe little man sat looking at Manuel.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d killed you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nManuel knocked with his knuckles on the\ndesk.

He\nhad seen it often before. He felt a certain\nfamily interest in it. It had killed his brother,\nthe promising one, about nine years ago. Manuel\nremembered the day. There was a brass\nplate on the oak shield the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head was\nmounted on. Manuel could not read it, but\nhe imagined it was in memory of his brother.\nWell, he had been a good kid.\nThe plate said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Bull \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mariposa\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the\nDuke of Veragua, which accepted 9 varas for 7\ncaballos, and caused the death of Antonio Garcia,\nNovillero, April 27, 1909.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRetana saw him looking at the stuffed bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhead.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lot the Duke sent me for Sunday will\nmake a scandal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all bad in\nthe legs.

He felt sleepy\nhimself. It was too hot to go out into the town.\nBesides there was nothing to do. He wanted\nto see Zurito. He would go to sleep while he\nwaited. He kicked his suitcase under the table\nto be sure it was there. Perhaps it would be\nbetter to put it back under the seat, against the\nwall. He leaned down and shoved it under.\nThen he leaned forward on the table and went\nto sleep.\nWhen he woke there was some one sitting\nacross the table from him. It was a big man\nwith a heavy brown face like an Indian. He\nhad been sitting there some time. He had\nwaved the waiter away and sat reading the\npaper and occasionally looking down at Manuel,\nasleep, his head on the table. He read the paper\nlaboriously, forming the words with his lips as\nhe read.

He had taken the bandage off\nhis right eye and cut the strings where they had\ntied his ears tight shut at the base. He was a\ngood, solid horse, solid on his legs. That was\nall he needed. He intended to ride him all\nthrough the corrida. He had already, since he\nhad mounted, sitting in the half-dark in the\nbig, quilted saddle, waiting for the paseo, pic-ed\nthrough the whole corrida in his mind. The\nother picadors went on talking on both sides of\nhim. He did not hear them.\nThe two matadors stood together in front of\ntheir three peones, their capes furled over their\nleft arms in the same fashion. Manuel was\nthinking about the three lads in back of him.\nThey were all three Madrile\u00c3\u00b1os, like Hernandez,\nboys about nineteen. One of them, a\ngypsy, serious, aloof, and dark-faced, he liked\nthe look of. He turned.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your name, kid?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked the\ngypsy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFuentes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the gypsy said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said.\nThe gypsy smiled, showing his teeth.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou take the bull and give him a little run\nwhen he comes out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the gypsy said. His face was\nserious. He began to think about just what he\nwould do.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere she goes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said to Hernandez.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHeads up, swinging with the music, their\nright arms swinging free, they stepped out,\ncrossing the sanded arena under the arc-lights,\nthe cuadrillas opening out behind, the picadors\nriding after, behind came the bull-ring servants\nand the jingling mules. The crowd applauded\nHernandez as they marched across the arena.\nArrogant, swinging, they looked straight ahead\nas they marched.\nThey bowed before the president, and the\nprocession broke up into its component parts.\nThe bull-fighters went over to the barrera and\nchanged their heavy mantles for the light fighting\ncapes. The mules went out. The picadors\ngalloped jerkily around the ring, and two rode\nout the gate they had come in by. The servants\nswept the sand smooth.\nManuel drank a glass of water poured for\nhim by one of Retana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputies, who was acting\nas his manager and sword-handler. Hernandez\ncame over from speaking with his own manager.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou got a good hand, kid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel complimented\nhim.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey like me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hernandez said happily.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did the paseo go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel asked\nRetana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike a wedding,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the handler. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFine.\nYou came out like Joselito and Belmonte.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nZurito rode by, a bulky equestrian statue. He\nwheeled his horse and faced him toward the\ntoril on the far side of the ring where the bull\nwould come out. It was strange under the arc-light.\nHe pic-ed in the hot afternoon sun for\nbig money. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like this arc-light business.\nHe wished they would get started.\nManuel went up to him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPic him, Manos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCut him down\nto size for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pic him, kid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito spat on the sand.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make him jump out of the ring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLean on him, Manos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lean on him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nholding it up?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said.\nZurito sat there, his feet in the box-stirrups,\nhis great legs in the buckskin-covered armor\ngripping the horse, the reins in his left hand,\nthe long pic held in his right hand, his broad\nhat well down over his eyes to shade them from\nthe lights, watching the distant door of the toril.\nHis horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears quivered. Zurito patted him\nwith his left hand.\nThe red door of the toril swung back and for\na moment Zurito looked into the empty passageway\nfar across the arena. Then the bull came\nout in a rush, skidding on his four legs as he\ncame out under the lights, then charging in a\ngallop, moving softly in a fast gallop, silent\nexcept as he woofed through wide nostrils as he\ncharged, glad to be free after the dark pen.\nIn the first row of seats, slightly bored, leaning\nforward to write on the cement wall in front\nof his knees, the substitute bull-fight critic of\nEl Heraldo scribbled: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCampagnero, Negro,\n42, came out at 90 miles an hour with plenty of\ngas\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nManuel, leaning against the barrera, watching\nthe bull, waved his hand and the gypsy ran\nout, trailing his cape. The bull, in full gallop,\npivoted and charged the cape, his head down,\nhis tail rising. The gypsy moved in a zigzag,\nand as he passed, the bull caught sight of him\nand abandoned the cape to charge the man. The\ngyp sprinted and vaulted the red fence of the\nbarrera as the bull struck it with his horns. He\ntossed into it twice with his horns, banging into\nthe wood blindly.\nThe critic of El Heraldo lit a cigarette and\ntossed the match at the bull, then wrote in his\nnote-book, \u00e2\u0080\u009clarge and with enough horns to satisfy\nthe cash customers, Campagnero showed a\ntendency to cut into the terrane of the bull-fighters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nManuel stepped out on the hard sand as the\nbull banged into the fence. Out of the corner\nof his eye he saw Zurito sitting the white horse\nclose to the barrera, about a quarter of the way\naround the ring to the left. Manuel held the\ncape close in front of him, a fold in each hand,\nand shouted at the bull. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHuh! Huh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nbull turned, seemed to brace against the fence\nas he charged in a scramble, driving into the\ncape as Manuel side-stepped, pivoted on his\nheels with the charge of the bull, and swung the\ncape just ahead of the horns. At the end of\nthe swing he was facing the bull again and held\nthe cape in the same position close in front of\nhis body, and pivoted again as the bull recharged.\nEach time, as he swung, the crowd\nshouted.\nFour times he swung with the bull, lifting\nthe cape so it billowed full, and each time bringing\nthe bull around to charge again. Then, at\nthe end of the fifth swing, he held the cape\nagainst his hip and pivoted, so the cape swung\nout like a ballet dancer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirt and wound the\nbull around himself like a belt, to step clear,\nleaving the bull facing Zurito on the white\nhorse, come up and planted firm, the horse facing\nthe bull, its ears forward, its lips nervous,\nZurito, his hat over his eyes, leaning forward,\nthe long pole sticking out before and behind in\na sharp angle under his right arm, held half-way\ndown, the triangular iron point facing the\nbull.\nEl Heraldo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second-string critic, drawing on\nhis cigarette, his eyes on the bull, wrote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nveteran Manolo designed a series of acceptable\nveronicas, ending in a very Belmontistic recorte\nthat earned applause from the regulars, and we\nentered the tercio of the cavalry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nZurito sat his horse, measuring the distance\nbetween the bull and the end of the pic. As he\nlooked, the bull gathered himself together and\ncharged, his eyes on the horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest. As he\nlowered his head to hook, Zurito sunk the point\nof the pic in the swelling hump of muscle above\nthe bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, leaned all his weight on\nthe shaft, and with his left hand pulled the\nwhite horse into the air, front hoofs pawing,\nand swung him to the right as he pushed the\nbull under and through so the horns passed\nsafely under the horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belly and the horse\ncame down, quivering, the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail brushing\nhis chest as he charged the cape Hernandez offered\nhim.\nHernandez ran sideways, taking the bull out\nand away with the cape, toward the other picador.\nHe fixed him with a swing of the cape,\nsquarely facing the horse and rider, and stepped\nback. As the bull saw the horse he charged.\nThe picador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lance slid along his back, and as\nthe shock of the charge lifted the horse, the\npicador was already half-way out of the saddle,\nlifting his right leg clear as he missed\nwith the lance and falling to the left side to\nkeep the horse between him and the bull. The\nhorse, lifted and gored, crashed over with the\nbull driving into him, the picador gave a shove\nwith his boots against the horse and lay clear,\nwaiting to be lifted and hauled away and put\non his feet.\nManuel let the bull drive into the fallen\nhorse; he was in no hurry, the picador was safe;\nbesides, it did a picador like that good to worry.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d stay on longer next time. Lousy pics! He\nlooked across the sand at Zurito a little way\nout from the barrera, his horse rigid, waiting.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHuh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called to the bull, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTomar!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nholding the cape in both hands so it would catch\nhis eye. The bull detached himself from the\nhorse and charged the cape, and Manuel, running\nsideways and holding the cape spread wide,\nstopped, swung on his heels, and brought the\nbull sharply around facing Zurito.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCampagnero accepted a pair of varas for the\ndeath of one rosinante, with Hernandez and\nManolo at the quites,\u00e2\u0080\u009d El Heraldo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critic wrote.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe pressed on the iron and clearly showed he\nwas no horse-lover. The veteran Zurito resurrected\nsome of his old stuff with the pike-pole,\nnotably the suerte\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOl\u00c3\u00a9 Ol\u00c3\u00a9!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man sitting beside him\nshouted. The shout was lost in the roar of the\ncrowd, and he slapped the critic on the back.\nThe critic looked up to see Zurito, directly below\nhim, leaning far out over his horse, the\nlength of the pic rising in a sharp angle under\nhis armpit, holding the pic almost by the point,\nbearing down with all his weight, holding the\nbull off, the bull pushing and driving to get at\nthe horse, and Zurito, far out, on top of him,\nholding him, holding him, and slowly pivoting\nthe horse against the pressure, so that at\nlast he was clear. Zurito felt the moment when\nthe horse was clear and the bull could come\npast, and relaxed the absolute steel lock of\nhis resistance, and the triangular steel point of\nthe pic ripped in the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hump of shoulder\nmuscle as he tore loose to find Hernandez\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncape before his muzzle. He charged blindly\ninto the cape and the boy took him out into the\nopen arena.\nZurito sat patting his horse and looking at the\nbull charging the cape that Hernandez swung\nfor him out under the bright light while the\ncrowd shouted.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see that one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to Manuel.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a wonder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI got him that time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook\nat him now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAt the conclusion of a closely turned pass of\nthe cape the bull slid to his knees. He was up\nat once, but far out across the sand Manuel and\nZurito saw the shine of the pumping flow of\nblood, smooth against the black of the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshoulder.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI got him that time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good bull,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they gave me another shot at him, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nkill him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll change the thirds on us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel\nsaid.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at him now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI got to go over there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said, and\nstarted on a run for the other side of the ring,\nwhere the monos were leading a horse out by\nthe bridle toward the bull, whacking him on the\nlegs with rods and all, in a procession, trying to\nget him toward the bull, who stood, dropping\nhis head, pawing, unable to make up his mind\nto charge.\nZurito, sitting his horse, walking him toward\nthe scene, not missing any detail, scowled.\nFinally the bull charged, the horse leaders\nran for the barrera, the picador hit too far back,\nand the bull got under the horse, lifted him,\nthrew him onto his back.\nZurito watched. The monos, in their red\nshirts, running out to drag the picador clear.\nThe picador, now on his feet, swearing and flopping\nhis arms. Manuel and Hernandez standing\nready with their capes. And the bull, the\ngreat, black bull, with a horse on his back,\nhooves dangling, the bridle caught in the horns.\nBlack bull with a horse on his back, staggering\nshort-legged, then arching his neck and lifting,\nthrusting, charging to slide the horse off, horse\nsliding down. Then the bull into a lunging\ncharge at the cape Manuel spread for him.\nThe bull was slower now, Manuel felt. He\nwas bleeding badly. There was a sheen of\nblood all down his flank.\nManuel offered him the cape again. There\nhe came, eyes open, ugly, watching the cape.\nManuel stepped to the side and raised his arms,\ntightening the cape ahead of the bull for the\nveronica.\nNow he was facing the bull. Yes, his head\nwas going down a little. He was carrying it\nlower. That was Zurito.\nManuel flopped the cape; there he comes; he\nside-stepped and swung in another veronica.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shooting awfully accurately, he thought.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had enough fight, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watching now.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hunting now. Got his eye on me. But I\nalways give him the cape.\nHe shook the cape at the bull; there he\ncomes; he side-stepped. Awful close that time.\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to work that close to him.\nThe edge of the cape was wet with blood\nwhere it had swept along the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back as he\nwent by.\nAll right, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the last one.\nManuel, facing the bull, having turned with\nhim each charge, offered the cape with his two\nhands. The bull looked at him. Eyes watching,\nhorns straight forward, the bull looked at\nhim, watching.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHuh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cToro!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and leaning\nback, swung the cape forward. Here he comes.\nHe side-stepped, swung the cape in back of him,\nand pivoted, so the bull followed a swirl of\ncape and then was left with nothing, fixed by\nthe pass, dominated by the cape. Manuel swung\nthe cape under his muzzle with one hand, to\nshow the bull was fixed, and walked away.\nThere was no applause.\nManuel walked across the sand toward the\nbarrera, while Zurito rode out of the ring. The\ntrumpet had blown to change the act to the\nplanting of the banderillos while Manuel had\nbeen working with the bull. He had not consciously\nnoticed it. The monos were spreading\ncanvas over the two dead horses and sprinkling\nsawdust around them.\nManuel came up to the barrera for a drink of\nwater. Retana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man handed him the heavy\nporous jug.\nFuentes, the tall gypsy, was standing holding\na pair of banderillos, holding them together,\nslim, red sticks, fish-hook points out. He looked\nat Manuel.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on out there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said.\nThe gypsy trotted out. Manuel set down\nthe jug and watched. He wiped his face with\nhis handkerchief.\nThe critic of El Heraldo reached for the bottle\nof warm champagne that stood between his\nfeet, took a drink, and finished his paragraph.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094the aged Manolo rated no applause for\na vulgar series of lances with the cape and we\nentered the third of the palings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAlone in the centre of the ring the bull stood,\nstill fixed. Fuentes, tall, flat-backed, walking\ntoward him arrogantly, his arms spread out, the\ntwo slim, red sticks, one in each hand, held by\nthe fingers, points straight forward. Fuentes\nwalked forward. Back of him and to one side\nwas a peon with a cape. The bull looked at him\nand was no longer fixed.\nHis eyes watched Fuentes, now standing still.\nNow he leaned back, calling to him. Fuentes\ntwitched the two banderillos and the light on\nthe steel points caught the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye.\nHis tail went up and he charged.\nHe came straight, his eyes on the man.\nFuentes stood still, leaning back, the banderillos\npointing forward. As the bull lowered his head\nto hook, Fuentes leaned backward, his arms\ncame together and rose, his two hands touching,\nthe banderillos two descending red lines,\nand leaning forward drove the points into the\nbull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, leaning far in over the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhorns and pivoting on the two upright sticks,\nhis legs tight together, his body curving to one\nside to let the bull pass.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOl\u00c3\u00a9!\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the crowd.\nThe bull was hooking wildly, jumping like a\ntrout, all four feet off the ground. The red\nshaft of the banderillos tossed as he jumped.\nManuel standing at the barrera, noticed that\nhe hooked always to the right.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell him to drop the next pair on the right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe said to the kid who started to run out to\nFuentes with the new banderillos.\nA heavy hand fell on his shoulder. It was\nZurito.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you feel, kid?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\nManuel was watching the bull.\nZurito leaned forward on the barrera, leaning\nthe weight of his body on his arms. Manuel\nturned to him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\nManuel shook his head. He had nothing to\ndo now until the next third. The gypsy was\nvery good with the banderillos. The bull\nwould come to him in the next third in good\nshape. He was a good bull. It had all been\neasy up to now. The final stuff with the sword\nwas all he worried over. He did not really\nworry. He did not even think about it. But\nstanding there he had a heavy sense of apprehension.\nHe looked out at the bull, planning\nhis faena, his work with the red cloth that was\nto reduce the bull, to make him manageable.\nThe gypsy was walking out toward the bull\nagain, walking heel-and-toe, insultingly, like a\nball-room dancer, the red shafts of the banderillos\ntwitching with his walk. The bull watched\nhim, not fixed now, hunting him, but waiting to\nget close enough so he could be sure of getting\nhim, getting the horns into him.\nAs Fuentes walked forward the bull charged.\nFuentes ran across the quarter of a circle as the\nbull charged and, as he passed running backward,\nstopped, swung forward, rose on his toes,\narms straight out, and sunk the banderillos\nstraight down into the tight of the big shoulder\nmuscles as the bull missed him.\nThe crowd were wild about it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat kid won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay in this night stuff long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRetana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man said to Zurito.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWatch him now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThey watched.\nFuentes was standing with his back against\nthe barrera. Two of the cuadrilla were back\nof him, with their capes ready to flop over the\nfence to distract the bull.\nThe bull, with his tongue out, his barrel\nheaving, was watching the gypsy. He thought\nhe had him now. Back against the red planks.\nOnly a short charge away. The bull watched\nhim.\nThe gypsy bent back, drew back his arms,\nthe banderillos pointing at the bull. He called\nto the bull, stamped one foot. The bull was\nsuspicious. He wanted the man. No more\nbarbs in the shoulder.\nFuentes walked a little closer to the bull.\nBent back. Called again. Somebody in the\ncrowd shouted a warning.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too damn close,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWatch him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Retana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man said.\nLeaning back, inciting the bull with the\nbanderillos, Fuentes jumped, both feet off the\nground. As he jumped the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail rose and\nhe charged. Fuentes came down on his toes,\narms straight out, whole body arching forward,\nand drove the shafts straight down as he swung\nhis body clear of the right horn.\nThe bull crashed into the barrera where the\nflopping capes had attracted his eye as he lost\nthe man.\nThe gypsy came running along the barrera\ntoward Manuel, taking the applause of the\ncrowd. His vest was ripped where he had not\nquite cleared the point of the horn. He was\nhappy about it, showing it to the spectators. He\nmade the tour of the ring. Zurito saw him go\nby, smiling, pointing at his vest. He smiled.\nSomebody else was planting the last pair of\nbanderillos. Nobody was paying any attention.\nRetana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man tucked a baton inside the red\ncloth of a muleta, folded the cloth over it, and\nhanded it over the barrera to Manuel. He\nreached in the leather sword-case, took out a\nsword, and holding it by its leather scabbard,\nreached it over the fence to Manuel. Manuel\npulled the blade out by the red hilt and the\nscabbard fell limp.\nHe looked at Zurito. The big man saw he\nwas sweating.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you get him, kid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\nManuel nodded.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in good shape,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust like you want him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Retana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man assured\nhim.\nManuel nodded.\nThe trumpeter, up under the roof, blew for\nthe final act, and Manuel walked across the\narena toward where, up in the dark boxes, the\npresident must be.\nIn the front row of seats the substitute bull-fight\ncritic of El Heraldo took a long drink of\nthe warm champagne. He had decided it was\nnot worth while to write a running story and\nwould write up the corrida back in the office.\nWhat the hell was it anyway? Only a nocturnal.\nIf he missed anything he would get it out of the\nmorning papers. He took another drink of the\nchampagne. He had a date at Maxim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at\ntwelve. Who were these bull-fighters anyway?\nKids and bums. A bunch of bums. He put his\npad of paper in his pocket and looked over toward\nManuel, standing very much alone in the\nring, gesturing with his hat in a salute toward\na box he could not see high up in the dark\nplaza. Out in the ring the bull stood quiet,\nlooking at nothing.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dedicate this bull to you, Mr. President,\nand to the public of Madrid, the most intelligent\nand generous of the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was what\nManuel was saying. It was a formula. He said\nit all. It was a little long for nocturnal use.\nHe bowed at the dark, straightened, tossed\nhis hat over his shoulder, and, carrying the muleta\nin his left hand and the sword in his right,\nwalked out toward the bull.\nManuel walked toward the bull. The bull\nlooked at him; his eyes were quick. Manuel\nnoticed the way the banderillos hung down on\nhis left shoulder and the steady sheen of blood\nfrom Zurito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pic-ing. He noticed the way the\nbull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet were. As he walked forward, holding\nthe muleta in his left hand and the sword\nin his right, he watched the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet. The\nbull could not charge without gathering his feet\ntogether. Now he stood square on them, dully.\nManuel walked toward him, watching his\nfeet. This was all right. He could do this. He\nmust work to get the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head down, so he\ncould go in past the horns and kill him. He\ndid not think about the sword, not about killing\nthe bull. He thought about one thing at a time.\nThe coming things oppressed him, though.\nWalking forward, watching the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet, he\nsaw successively his eyes, his wet muzzle, and\nthe wide, forward-pointing spread of his horns.\nThe bull had light circles about his eyes. His\neyes watched Manuel. He felt he was going to\nget this little one with the white face.\nStanding still now and spreading the red\ncloth of the muleta with the sword, pricking the\npoint into the cloth so that the sword, now held\nin his left hand, spread the red flannel like the\njib of a boat, Manuel noticed the points of the\nbull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horns. One of them was splintered from\nbanging against the barrera. The other was\nsharp as a porcupine quill. Manuel noticed\nwhile spreading the muleta that the white base\nof the horn was stained red. While he noticed\nthese things he did not lose sight of the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfeet. The bull watched Manuel steadily.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the defensive now, Manuel thought.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reserving himself. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to bring him\nout of that and get his head down. Always get\nhis head down. Zurito had his head down once,\nbut he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come back. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bleed when I start\nhim going and that will bring it down.\nHolding the muleta, with the sword in his\nleft hand widening it in front of him, he called\nto the bull.\nThe bull looked at him.\nHe leaned back insultingly and shook the\nwide-spread flannel.\nThe bull saw the muleta. It was a bright\nscarlet under the arc-light. The bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs\ntightened.\nHere he comes. Whoosh! Manuel turned\nas the bull came and raised the muleta so that\nit passed over the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horns and swept down\nhis broad back from head to tail. The bull had\ngone clean up in the air with the charge. Manuel\nhad not moved.\nAt the end of the pass the bull turned like\na cat coming around a corner and faced Manuel.\nHe was on the offensive again. His heaviness\nwas gone. Manuel noted the fresh blood\nshining down the black shoulder and dripping\ndown the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leg. He drew the sword out of\nthe muleta and held it in his right hand. The\nmuleta held low down in his left hand, leaning\ntoward the left, he called to the bull. The\nbull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs tightened, his eyes on the muleta.\nHere he comes, Manuel thought. Yuh!\nHe swung with the charge, sweeping the muleta\nahead of the bull, his feet firm, the sword\nfollowing the curve, a point of light under the\narcs.\nThe bull recharged as the pase natural finished\nand Manuel raised the muleta for a pase\nde pecho. Firmly planted, the bull came by his\nchest under the raised muleta. Manuel leaned\nhis head back to avoid the clattering banderillo\nshafts. The hot, black bull body touched his\nchest as it passed.\nToo damn close, Manuel thought. Zurito,\nleaning on the barrera, spoke rapidly to the\ngypsy, who trotted out toward Manuel with a\ncape. Zurito pulled his hat down low and\nlooked out across the arena at Manuel.\nManuel was facing the bull again, the muleta\nheld low and to the left. The bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head was\ndown as he watched the muleta.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it was Belmonte doing that stuff, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\ngo crazy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Retana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man said.\nZurito said nothing. He was watching Manuel\nout in the centre of the arena.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere did the boss dig this fellow up?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRetana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut of the hospital,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going damn quick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Retana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nman said.\nZurito turned on him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKnock on that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, pointing to the barrera.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was just kidding, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Retana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKnock on the wood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRetana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man leaned forward and knocked\nthree times on the barrera.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWatch the faena,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\nOut in the centre of the ring, under the\nlights, Manuel was kneeling, facing the bull,\nand as he raised the muleta in both hands the\nbull charged, tail up.\nManuel swung his body clear and, as the bull\nrecharged, brought around the muleta in a half-circle\nthat pulled the bull to his knees.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, that one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great bull-fighter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Retana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nman said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Zurito.\nManuel stood up and, the muleta in his left\nhand, the sword in his right, acknowledged the\napplause from the dark plaza.\nThe bull had humped himself up from his\nknees and stood waiting, his head hung low.\nZurito spoke to two of the other lads of the\ncuadrilla and they ran out to stand back of\nManuel with their capes. There were four men\nback of him now. Hernandez had followed\nhim since he first came out with the muleta.\nFuentes stood watching, his cape held against\nhis body, tall, in repose, watching lazy-eyed.\nNow the two came up. Hernandez motioned\nthem to stand one at each side. Manuel stood\nalone, facing the bull.\nManuel waved back the men with the capes.\nStepping back cautiously, they saw his face was\nwhite and sweating.\nDidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they know enough to keep back? Did\nthey want to catch the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye with the capes\nafter he was fixed and ready? He had enough\nto worry about without that kind of thing.\nThe bull was standing, his four feet square,\nlooking at the muleta. Manuel furled the muleta\nin his left hand. The bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes watched\nit. His body was heavy on his feet. He carried\nhis head low, but not too low.\nManuel lifted the muleta at him. The bull\ndid not move. Only his eyes watched.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all lead, Manuel thought. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all\nsquare. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s framed right. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take it.\nHe thought in bull-fight terms. Sometimes\nhe had a thought and the particular piece of\nslang would not come into his mind and he\ncould not realize the thought. His instincts\nand his knowledge worked automatically, and\nhis brain worked slowly and in words. He knew\nall about bulls. He did not have to think about\nthem. He just did the right thing. His eyes\nnoted things and his body performed the necessary\nmeasures without thought. If he thought\nabout it, he would be gone.\nNow, facing the bull, he was conscious of\nmany things at the same time. There were the\nhorns, the one splintered, the other smoothly\nsharp, the need to profile himself toward the\nleft horn, lance himself short and straight,\nlower the muleta so the bull would follow it,\nand, going in over the horns, put the sword all\nthe way into a little spot about as big as a five-peseta\npiece straight in back of the neck, between\nthe sharp pitch of the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders.\nHe must do all this and must then come out\nfrom between the horns. He was conscious he\nmust do all this, but his only thought was in\nwords: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCorto y derecho.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCorto y derecho,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought, furling the\nmuleta. Short and straight. Corto y derecho,\nhe drew the sword out of the muleta, profiled\non the splintered left horn, dropped the muleta\nacross his body, so his right hand with the sword\non the level with his eye made the sign of the\ncross, and, rising on his toes, sighted along the\ndipping blade of the sword at the spot high up\nbetween the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders.\nCorto y derecho he lanced himself on the\nbull.\nThere was a shock, and he felt himself go\nup in the air. He pushed on the sword as he\nwent up and over, and it flew out of his hand.\nHe hit the ground and the bull was on him.\nManuel, lying on the ground, kicked at the\nbull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s muzzle with his slippered feet. Kicking,\nkicking, the bull after him, missing him in his\nexcitement, bumping him with his head, driving\nthe horns into the sand. Kicking like a man\nkeeping a ball in the air, Manuel kept the bull\nfrom getting a clean thrust at him.\nManuel felt the wind on his back from the\ncapes flopping at the bull, and then the bull was\ngone, gone over him in a rush. Dark, as his\nbelly went over. Not even stepped on.\nManuel stood up and picked up the muleta.\nFuentes handed him the sword. It was bent\nwhere it had struck the shoulder-blade. Manuel\nstraightened it on his knee and ran toward\nthe bull, standing now beside one of the dead\nhorses. As he ran, his jacket flopped where it\nhad been ripped under his armpit.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet him out of there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel shouted to\nthe gypsy. The bull had smelled the blood\nof the dead horse and ripped into the canvas-cover\nwith his horns. He charged Fuentes\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncape, with the canvas hanging from his splintered\nhorn, and the crowd laughed. Out in the\nring, he tossed his head to rid himself of the\ncanvas. Hernandez, running up from behind\nhim, grabbed the end of the canvas and neatly\nlifted it off the horn.\nThe bull followed it in a half-charge and\nstopped still. He was on the defensive again.\nManuel was walking toward him with the sword\nand muleta. Manuel swung the muleta before\nhim. The bull would not charge.\nManuel profiled toward the bull, sighting\nalong the dipping blade of the sword. The\nbull was motionless, seemingly dead on his feet,\nincapable of another charge.\nManuel rose to his toes, sighting along the\nsteel, and charged.\nAgain there was the shock and he felt himself\nbeing borne back in a rush, to strike hard on the\nsand. There was no chance of kicking this time.\nThe bull was on top of him. Manuel lay as\nthough dead, his head on his arms, and the bull\nbumped him. Bumped his back, bumped his\nface in the sand. He felt the horn go into the\nsand between his folded arms. The bull hit\nhim in the small of the back. His face drove\ninto the sand. The horn drove through one of\nhis sleeves and the bull ripped it off. Manuel\nwas tossed clear and the bull followed the capes.\nManuel got up, found the sword and muleta,\ntried the point of the sword with his thumb, and\nthen ran toward the barrera for a new sword.\nRetana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man handed him the sword over\nthe edge of the barrera.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWipe off your face,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nManuel, running again toward the bull,\nwiped his bloody face with his handkerchief.\nHe had not seen Zurito. Where was Zurito?\nThe cuadrilla had stepped away from the\nbull and waited with their capes. The bull\nstood, heavy and dull again after the action.\nManuel walked toward him with the muleta.\nHe stopped and shook it. The bull did not respond.\nHe passed it right and left, left and\nright before the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s muzzle. The bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes\nwatched it and turned with the swing, but he\nwould not charge. He was waiting for Manuel.\nManuel was worried. There was nothing to\ndo but go in. Corto y derecho. He profiled\nclose to the bull, crossed the muleta in front\nof his body and charged. As he pushed in the\nsword, he jerked his body to the left to clear\nthe horn. The bull passed him and the sword\nshot up in the air, twinkling under the arc-lights,\nto fall red-hilted on the sand.\nManuel ran over and picked it up. It was\nbent and he straightened it over his knee.\nAs he came running toward the bull, fixed\nagain now, he passed Hernandez standing with\nhis cape.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all bone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the boy said encouragingly.\nManuel nodded, wiping his face. He put the\nbloody handkerchief in his pocket.\nThere was the bull. He was close to the barrera\nnow. Damn him. Maybe he was all bone.\nMaybe there was not any place for the sword to\ngo in. The hell there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d show\nthem.\nHe tried a pass with the muleta and the bull\ndid not move. Manuel chopped the muleta back\nand forth in front of the bull. Nothing doing.\nHe furled the muleta, drew the sword out,\nprofiled and drove in on the bull. He felt the\nsword buckle as he shoved it in, leaning his\nweight on it, and then it shot high in the air,\nend-over-ending into the crowd. Manuel had\njerked clear as the sword jumped.\nThe first cushions thrown down out of the\ndark missed him. Then one hit him in the face,\nhis bloody face looking toward the crowd. They\nwere coming down fast. Spotting the sand.\nSomebody threw an empty champagne-bottle\nfrom close range. It hit Manuel on the foot.\nHe stood there watching the dark, where the\nthings were coming from. Then something\nwhished through the air and struck by him.\nManuel leaned over and picked it up. It was\nhis sword. He straightened it over his knee and\ngestured with it to the crowd.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOh, the dirty bastards! Dirty bastards! Oh,\nthe lousy, dirty bastards! He kicked into a\ncushion as he ran.\nThere was the bull. The same as ever. All\nright, you dirty, lousy bastard!\nManuel passed the muleta in front of the\nbull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s black muzzle.\nNothing doing.\nYou won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t! All right. He stepped close\nand jammed the sharp peak of the muleta into\nthe bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damp muzzle.\nThe bull was on him as he jumped back and\nas he tripped on a cushion he felt the horn go\ninto him, into his side. He grabbed the horn\nwith his two hands and rode backward, holding\ntight onto the place. The bull tossed him and\nhe was clear. He lay still. It was all right.\nThe bull was gone.\nHe got up coughing and feeling broken and\ngone. The dirty bastards!\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me the sword,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive\nme the stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFuentes came up with the muleta and the\nsword.\nHernandez put his arm around him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on to the infirmary, man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a damn fool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet away from me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet to\nhell away from me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe twisted free. Hernandez shrugged his\nshoulders. Manuel ran toward the bull.\nThere was the bull standing, heavy, firmly\nplanted.\nAll right, you bastard! Manuel drew the\nsword out of the muleta, sighted with the same\nmovement, and flung himself onto the bull.\nHe felt the sword go in all the way. Right up\nto the guard. Four fingers and his thumb into\nthe bull. The blood was hot on his knuckles,\nand he was on top of the bull.\nThe bull lurched with him as he lay on, and\nseemed to sink; then he was standing clear. He\nlooked at the bull going down slowly over on\nhis side, then suddenly four feet in the air.\nThen he gestured at the crowd, his hand\nwarm from the bull blood.\nAll right, you bastards! He wanted to say\nsomething, but he started to cough. It was hot\nand choking. He looked down for the muleta.\nHe must go over and salute the president.\nPresident hell! He was sitting down looking at\nsomething. It was the bull. His four feet up.\nThick tongue out. Things crawling around on\nhis belly and under his legs. Crawling where\nthe hair was thin. Dead bull. To hell with\nthe bull! To hell with them all! He started to\nget to his feet and commenced to cough. He\nsat down again, coughing. Somebody came and\npushed him up.\nThey carried him across the ring to the infirmary,\nrunning with him across the sand,\nstanding blocked at the gate as the mules came\nin, then around under the dark passageway, men\ngrunting as they took him up the stairway, and\nthen laid him down.\nThe doctor and two men in white were waiting\nfor him. They laid him out on the table.\nThey were cutting away his shirt. Manuel felt\ntired. His whole chest felt scalding inside.\nHe started to cough and they held something\nto his mouth. Everybody was very busy.\nThere was an electric light in his eyes. He\nshut his eyes.\nHe heard some one coming very heavily up\nthe stairs. Then he did not hear it. Then he\nheard a noise far off. That was the crowd.\nWell, somebody would have to kill his other\nbull. They had cut away all his shirt. The\ndoctor smiled at him. There was Retana.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello, Retana!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said. He could\nnot hear his voice.\nRetana smiled at him and said something.\nManuel could not hear it.\nZurito stood beside the table, bending over\nwhere the doctor was working. He was in his\npicador clothes, without his hat.\nZurito said something to him. Manuel could\nnot hear it.\nZurito was speaking to Retana. One of the\nmen in white smiled and handed Retana a pair\nof scissors. Retana gave them to Zurito.\nZurito said something to Manuel. He could\nnot hear it.\nTo hell with this operating-table! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nbeen on plenty of operating-tables before. He\nwas not going to die. There would be a priest\nif he was going to die.\nZurito was saying something to him. Holding\nup the scissors.\nThat was it. They were going to cut off his\ncoleta. They were going to cut off his pigtail.\nManuel sat up on the operating-table. The\ndoctor stepped back, angry. Some one grabbed\nhim and held him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a thing like that, Manos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe said.\nHe heard suddenly, clearly, Zurito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do\nit. I was joking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was going good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave any luck. That was all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nManuel lay back. They had put something\nover his face. It was all familiar. He inhaled\ndeeply. He felt very tired. He was very,\nvery tired. They took the thing away from his\nface.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was going good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manuel said weakly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was going great.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRetana looked at Zurito and started for the\ndoor.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay here with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zurito said.\nRetana shrugged his shoulders.\nManuel opened his eyes and looked at Zurito.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I going good, Manos?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked,\nfor confirmation.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Zurito. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou were going great.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistant put the cone over Manuel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nface and he inhaled deeply. Zurito stood\nawkwardly, watching.",
