    "body": "In the fall the war was always there, but we\ndid not go to it any more. It was cold in the\nfall in Milan and the dark came very early.\nThen the electric lights came on, and it was\npleasant along the streets looking in the windows.\nThere was much game hanging outside\nthe shops, and the snow powdered in the fur\nof the foxes and the wind blew their tails. The\ndeer hung stiff and heavy and empty, and small\nbirds blew in the wind and the wind turned their\nfeathers. It was a cold fall and the wind came\ndown from the mountains.\nWe were all at the hospital every afternoon,\nand there were different ways of walking across\nthe town through the dusk to the hospital. Two\nof the ways were alongside canals, but they were\nlong. Always, though, you crossed a bridge\nacross a canal to enter the hospital. There was a\nchoice of three bridges. On one of them a\nwoman sold roasted chestnuts. It was warm,\nstanding in front of her charcoal fire, and the\nchestnuts were warm afterward in your pocket.\nThe hospital was very old and very beautiful,\nand you entered through a gate and walked\nacross a courtyard and out a gate on the other\nside. There were usually funerals starting from\nthe courtyard. Beyond the old hospital were\nthe new brick pavilions, and there we met every\nafternoon and were all very polite and interested\nin what was the matter, and sat in the machines\nthat were to make so much difference.\nThe doctor came up to the machine where\nI was sitting and said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did you like best\nto do before the war? Did you practise a\nsport?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, football.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will be able to play\nfootball again better than ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMy knee did not bend and the leg dropped\nstraight from the knee to the ankle without a\ncalf, and the machine was to bend the knee and\nmake it move as in riding a tricycle. But it did\nnot bend yet, and instead the machine lurched\nwhen it came to the bending part. The doctor\nsaid: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat will all pass. You are a fortunate\nyoung man. You will play football again like\na champion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIn the next machine was a major who had a\nlittle hand like a baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. He winked at me\nwhen the doctor examined his hand, which was\nbetween two leather straps that bounced up and\ndown and flapped the stiff fingers, and said:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd will I too play football, captain-doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe had been a very great fencer, and before the\nwar the greatest fencer in Italy.\nThe doctor went to his office in a back room\nand brought a photograph which showed a\nhand that had been withered almost as small\nas the major\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, before it had taken a machine\ncourse, and after was a little larger. The major\nheld the photograph with his good hand and\nlooked at it very carefully. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA wound?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nasked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn industrial accident,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery interesting, very interesting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major\nsaid, and handed it back to the doctor.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have confidence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the major.\nThere were three boys who came each day\nwho were about the same age I was. They were\nall three from Milan, and one of them was to\nbe a lawyer, and one was to be a painter, and\none had intended to be a soldier, and after we\nwere finished with the machines, sometimes we\nwalked back together to the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Cova, which\nwas next door to the Scala. We walked the\nshort way through the communist quarter because\nwe were four together. The people hated\nus because we were officers, and from a wine-shop\nsome one would call out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA basso gli ufficiali!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nas we passed. Another boy who walked\nwith us sometimes and made us five wore a\nblack silk handkerchief across his face because\nhe had no nose then and his face was to be rebuilt.\nHe had gone out to the front from the\nmilitary academy and been wounded within an\nhour after he had gone into the front line for\nthe first time. They rebuilt his face, but he\ncame from a very old family and they could\nnever get the nose exactly right. He went to\nSouth America and worked in a bank. But this\nwas a long time ago, and then we did not any\nof us know how it was going to be afterward.\nWe only knew then that there was always the\nwar, but that we were not going to it any more.\nWe all had the same medals, except the boy\nwith the black silk bandage across his face, and\nhe had not been at the front long enough to get\nany medals. The tall boy with a very pale face\nwho was to be a lawyer had been a lieutenant\nof Arditi and had three medals of the sort we\neach had only one of. He had lived a very long\ntime with death and was a little detached. We\nwere all a little detached, and there was nothing\nthat held us together except that we met\nevery afternoon at the hospital. Although, as\nwe walked to the Cova through the tough part\nof town, walking in the dark, with light and\nsinging coming out of the wine-shops, and sometimes\nhaving to walk into the street when the\nmen and women would crowd together on the\nsidewalk so that we would have had to jostle\nthem to get by, we felt held together by there\nbeing something that had happened that they,\nthe people who disliked us, did not understand.\nWe ourselves all understood the Cova, where\nit was rich and warm and not too brightly\nlighted, and noisy and smoky at certain hours,\nand there were always girls at the tables and\nthe illustrated papers on a rack on the wall.\nThe girls at the Cova were very patriotic, and I\nfound that the most patriotic people in Italy\nwere the caf\u00c3\u00a9 girls\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I believe they are still\npatriotic.\nThe boys at first were very polite about my\nmedals and asked me what I had done to get\nthem. I showed them the papers, which were\nwritten in very beautiful language and full of\nfratellanza and abnegazione, but which really\nsaid, with the adjectives removed, that I had\nbeen given the medals because I was an American.\nAfter that their manner changed a little\ntoward me, although I was their friend against\noutsiders. I was a friend, but I was never really\none of them after they had read the citations,\nbecause it had been different with them and they\nhad done very different things to get their\nmedals. I had been wounded, it was true; but\nwe all knew that being wounded, after all, was\nreally an accident. I was never ashamed of the\nribbons, though, and sometimes, after the cocktail\nhour, I would imagine myself having done\nall the things they had done to get their medals;\nbut walking home at night through the empty\nstreets with the cold wind and all the shops\nclosed, trying to keep near the street lights, I\nknew that I would never have done such things,\nand I was very much afraid to die, and often\nlay in bed at night by myself, afraid to die and\nwondering how I would be when I went back to\nthe front again.\nThe three with the medals were like hunting-hawks;\nand I was not a hawk, although I might\nseem a hawk to those who had never hunted;\nthey, the three, knew better and so we drifted\napart. But I stayed good friends with the boy\nwho had been wounded his first day at the front,\nbecause he would never know now how he\nwould have turned out; so he could never be\naccepted either, and I liked him because I\nthought perhaps he would not have turned out\nto be a hawk either.\nThe major, who had been the great fencer,\ndid not believe in bravery, and spent much time\nwhile we sat in the machines correcting my\ngrammar. He had complimented me on how\nI spoke Italian, and we talked together very\neasily. One day I had said that Italian seemed\nsuch an easy language to me that I could not\ntake a great interest in it; everything was so\neasy to say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\nthen, do you not take up the use of grammar?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSo we took up the use of grammar, and soon\nItalian was such a difficult language that I was\nafraid to talk to him until I had the grammar\nstraight in my mind.\nThe major came very regularly to the hospital.\nI do not think he ever missed a day, although\nI am sure he did not believe in the\nmachines. There was a time when none of us\nbelieved in the machines, and one day the major\nsaid it was all nonsense. The machines were\nnew then and it was we who were to prove them.\nIt was an idiotic idea, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca theory, like\nanother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I had not learned my grammar, and\nhe said I was a stupid impossible disgrace, and\nhe was a fool to have bothered with me. He\nwas a small man and he sat straight up in his\nchair with his right hand thrust into the machine\nand looked straight ahead at the wall\nwhile the straps thumped up and down with his\nfingers in them.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat will you do when the war is over if\nit is over?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak grammatically!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go to the States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you married?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, but I hope to be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more of a fool you are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He\nseemed very angry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA man must not marry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Signor Maggiore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call me \u00e2\u0080\u0098Signor Maggiore.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy must not a man marry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe cannot marry. He cannot marry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid angrily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he is to lose everything, he\nshould not place himself in a position to lose\nthat. He should not place himself in a position\nto lose. He should find things he cannot lose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe spoke very angrily and bitterly, and\nlooked straight ahead while he talked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why should he necessarily lose it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lose it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major said. He was\nlooking at the wall. Then he looked down at\nthe machine and jerked his little hand out from\nbetween the straps and slapped it hard against\nhis thigh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lose it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he almost shouted.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t argue with me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he called to the\nattendant who ran the machines. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome and\nturn this damned thing off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe went back into the other room for the\nlight treatment and the massage. Then I heard\nhim ask the doctor if he might use his telephone\nand he shut the door. When he came\nback into the room, I was sitting in another machine.\nHe was wearing his cape and had his\ncap on, and he came directly toward my machine\nand put his arm on my shoulder.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, and patted me on\nthe shoulder with his good hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not\nbe rude. My wife has just died. You must\nforgive me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, feeling sick for him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nso sorry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe stood there biting his lower lip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is\nvery difficult,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot resign myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe looked straight past me and out through\nthe window. Then he began to cry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am utterly\nunable to resign myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said and\nchoked. And then crying, his head up looking\nat nothing, carrying himself straight and soldierly,\nwith tears on both his cheeks and biting\nhis lips, he walked past the machines and out\nthe door.\nThe doctor told me that the major\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife,\nwho was very young and whom he had not married\nuntil he was definitely invalided out of the\nwar, had died of pneumonia. She had been\nsick only a few days. No one expected her to\ndie. The major did not come to the hospital\nfor three days. Then he came at the usual hour,\nwearing a black band on the sleeve of his uniform.\nWhen he came back, there were large\nframed photographs around the wall, of all sorts\nof wounds before and after they had been cured\nby the machines. In front of the machine the\nmajor used were three photographs of hands\nlike his that were completely restored. I do not\nknow where the doctor got them. I always understood\nwe were the first to use the machines.\nThe photographs did not make much difference\nto the major because he only looked out of the\nwindow.",
