    "name": "Hemingway - a Pursuit Race",
    "body": "William Campbell had been in a pursuit\nrace with a burlesque show ever since Pittsburgh.\nIn a pursuit race, in bicycle racing,\nriders start at equal intervals to ride after one\nanother. They ride very fast because the race\nis usually limited to a short distance and if they\nslow their riding another rider who maintains\nhis pace will make up the space that separated\nthem equally at the start. As soon as a rider\nis caught and passed he is out of the race and\nmust get down from his bicycle and leave the\ntrack. If none of the riders are caught the\nwinner of the race is the one who has gained the\nmost distance. In most pursuit races, if there\nare only two riders, one of the riders is caught\ninside of six miles. The burlesque show\ncaught William Campbell at Kansas City.\nWilliam Campbell had hoped to hold a slight\nlead over the burlesque show until they reached\nthe Pacific coast. As long as he preceded the\nburlesque show as advance man he was being\npaid. When the burlesque show caught up with\nhim he was in bed. He was in bed when the\nmanager of the burlesque troupe came into his\nroom and after the manager had gone out he\ndecided that he might as well stay in bed. It\nwas very cold in Kansas City and he was in no\nhurry to go out. He did not like Kansas City.\nHe reached under the bed for a bottle and\ndrank. It made his stomach feel better. Mr.\nTurner, the manager of the burlesque show,\nhad refused a drink.\nWilliam Campbell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interview with Mr.\nTurner had been a little strange. Mr. Turner\nhad knocked on the door. Campbell had said:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in!\u00e2\u0080\u009d When Mr. Turner came into the\nroom he saw clothing on a chair, an open suitcase,\nthe bottle on a chair beside the bed, and\nsome one lying in the bed completely covered\nby the bed-clothes.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMister Campbell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Turner said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fire me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d William Campbell said\nfrom underneath the covers. It was warm and\nwhite and close under the covers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nfire me because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got down off my bicycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re drunk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Turner said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d William Campbell said, speaking\ndirectly against the sheet and feeling the texture\nwith his lips.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fool,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Turner said. He\nturned off the electric light. The electric light\nhad been burning all night. It was now ten\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the morning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a drunken\nfool. When did you get into this town?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI got into this town last night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d William\nCampbell said, speaking against the sheet. He\nfound he liked to talk through a sheet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid\nyou ever talk through a sheet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to be funny.

Do you want to hear what I\nknow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said William Campbell. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause\nreally I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything at all. I was just\ntalking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pulled the sheet up over his\nface again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love it under a sheet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nMr. Turner stood beside the bed. He was a\nmiddle-aged man with a large stomach and a\nbald head and he had many things to do. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nought to stop off here, Billy, and take a cure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fix it up if you want to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to take a cure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d William Campbell\nsaid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to take a cure at all.\nI am perfectly happy.

But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got my wolf back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe touched the sheet with his tongue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had\nhim for a week.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hell you have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes.

The poor little fellow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nmoved his tongue round and round on the sheet.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lovely wolf. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like he always\nwas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d William Campbell shut his eyes and\ntook a deep breath.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou got to take a cure, Billy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Turner\nsaid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind the Keeley.

The\ncircles almost touched one another. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthe new development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d William Campbell said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI drink a little now once in a while, just to\ndrive the wolf out of the room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey got a cure for that, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sliding Billy\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTurner said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d William Campbell said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got a cure for anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just quit like that, Billy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turner\nsaid.

He knew\nthat this nausea would increase steadily, without\nthere ever being the relief of sickness, until\nsomething were done against it. It was at this\npoint that he suggested that Mr. Turner have\na drink. Mr. Turner declined. William Campbell\ntook a drink from the bottle. It was a temporary\nmeasure. Mr. Turner watched him.\nMr. Turner had been in this room much longer\nthan he should have been, he had many things\nto do; although living in daily association with\npeople who used drugs, he had a horror of\ndrugs, and he was very fond of William Campbell;\nhe did not wish to leave him. He was\nvery sorry for him and he felt a cure might\nhelp. He knew there were good cures in Kansas\nCity. But he had to go. He stood up.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, Billy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d William Campbell said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwant to tell you something.

Every time I try it, it catches.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe shut his eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t slide, Billy.
