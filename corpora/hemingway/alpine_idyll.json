    "body": "It was hot coming down into the valley even\nin the early morning. The sun melted the snow\nfrom the skis we were carrying and dried the\nwood. It was spring in the valley but the sun\nwas very hot. We came along the road into\nGaltur carrying our skis and rucksacks. As we\npassed the churchyard a burial was just over. I\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGr\u00c3\u00bcss Gott,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the priest as he walked\npast us coming out of the churchyard. The\npriest bowed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny a priest never speaks to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nJohn said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to say \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gr\u00c3\u00bcss\nGott.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey never answer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John said.\nWe stopped in the road and watched the sexton\nshovelling in the new earth. A peasant with\na black beard and high leather boots stood beside\nthe grave. The sexton stopped shovelling\nand straightened his back. The peasant in the\nhigh boots took the spade from the sexton and\nwent on filling in the grave\u00e2\u0080\u0094spreading the earth\nevenly as a man spreading manure in a garden.\nIn the bright May morning the grave-filling\nlooked unreal. I could not imagine any one\nbeing dead.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine being buried on a day like this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI said to John.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWe went on up the road past the houses of\nthe town to the inn. We had been skiing in\nthe Silvretta for a month, and it was good to\nbe down in the valley. In the Silvretta the skiing\nhad been all right, but it was spring skiing,\nthe snow was good only in the early morning\nand again in the evening. The rest of the time\nit was spoiled by the sun. We were both tired\nof the sun. You could not get away from the\nsun. The only shadows were made by rocks\nor by the hut that was built under the protection\nof a rock beside a glacier, and in the shade\nthe sweat froze in your underclothing. You\ncould not sit outside the hut without dark\nglasses. It was pleasant to be burned black but\nthe sun had been very tiring. You could not\nrest in it. I was glad to be down away from\nsnow. It was too late in the spring to be up in\nthe Silvretta. I was a little tired of skiing.\nWe had stayed too long. I could taste the snow\nwater we had been drinking melted off the tin\nroof of the hut. The taste was a part of the\nway I felt about skiing. I was glad there were\nother things beside skiing, and I was glad to\nbe down, away from the unnatural high mountain\nspring, into this May morning in the valley.\nThe innkeeper sat on the porch of the inn,\nhis chair tipped back against the wall. Beside\nhim sat the cook.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSki-heil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the innkeeper.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d we said and leaned the skis against\nthe wall and took off our packs.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow was it up above?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the innkeeper.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSch\u00c3\u00b6n. A little too much sun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too much sun this time of\nyear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe cook sat on in his chair. The innkeeper\nwent in with us and unlocked his office and\nbrought out our mail. There was a bundle of\nletters and some papers.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get some beer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll drink it inside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe proprietor brought two bottles and we\ndrank them while we read the letters.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe better have some more beer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John said.\nA girl brought it this time. She smiled as she\nopened the bottles.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMany letters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. Many.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProsit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said and went out, taking the\nempty bottles.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d forgotten what beer tasted like.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUp in the hut I\nused to think about it a lot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got it now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou oughtn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to ever do anything too long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. We were up there too long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToo damn long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no good\ndoing a thing too long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe sun came through the open window and\nshone through the beer bottles on the table.\nThe bottles were half full. There was a little\nfroth on the beer in the bottles, not much because\nit was very cold. It collared up when\nyou poured it into the tall glasses. I looked\nout of the open window at the white road. The\ntrees beside the road were dusty. Beyond was\na green field and a stream. There were trees\nalong the stream and a mill with a water wheel.\nThrough the open side of the mill I saw a long\nlog and a saw in it rising and falling. No one\nseemed to be tending it. There were four crows\nwalking in the green field. One crow sat in a\ntree watching. Outside on the porch the cook\ngot off his chair and passed into the hall that led\nback into the kitchen. Inside, the sunlight shone\nthrough the empty glasses on the table. John\nwas leaning forward with his head on his arms.\nThrough the window I saw two men come up\nthe front steps. They came into the drinking\nroom. One was the bearded peasant in the high\nboots. The other was the sexton. They sat\ndown at the table under the window. The girl\ncame in and stood by their table. The peasant\ndid not seem to see her. He sat with his hands\non the table. He wore his old army clothes.\nThere were patches on the elbows.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat will it be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the sexton. The\npeasant did not pay any attention.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat will you drink?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSchnapps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the peasant said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd a quarter litre of red wine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the sexton\ntold the girl.\nThe girl brought the drinks and the peasant\ndrank the schnapps. He looked out of the window.\nThe sexton watched him. John had his\nhead forward on the table. He was asleep.\nThe innkeeper came in and went over to the\ntable. He spoke in dialect and the sexton answered\nhim. The peasant looked out of the\nwindow. The innkeeper went out of the room.\nThe peasant stood up. He took a folded ten-thousand\nkronen note out of a leather pocket-book\nand unfolded it. The girl came up.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlles?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me buy the wine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the sexton said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the peasant repeated to the girl.\nShe put her hand in the pocket of her apron,\nbrought it out full of coins and counted out the\nchange. The peasant went out the door. As\nsoon as he was gone the innkeeper came into the\nroom again and spoke to the sexton. He sat\ndown at the table. They talked in dialect. The\nsexton was amused. The innkeeper was disgusted.\nThe sexton stood up from the table.\nHe was a little man with a mustache. He\nleaned out of the window and looked up the\nroad.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere he goes in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the L\u00c3\u00b6wen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThey talked again and then the innkeeper\ncame over to our table. The innkeeper was a tall\nman and old. He looked at John asleep.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty tired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, we were up early.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you want to eat soon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is there to eat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnything you want. The girl will bring the\neating-card.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe girl brought the menu. John woke up.\nThe menu was written in ink on a card and the\ncard slipped into a wooden paddle.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the speise-karte,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to John.\nHe looked at it. He was still sleepy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you have a drink with us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked\nthe innkeeper. He sat down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose peasants\nare beasts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the innkeeper.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe saw that one at a funeral coming into\ntown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was his wife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a beast. All these peasants are beasts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it. You wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe\nwhat just happened about that one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The innkeeper\nspoke to the sexton. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFranz, come over here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe sexton came, bringing his little bottle of\nwine and his glass.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gentlemen are just come down from\nthe Wiesbadenerh\u00c3\u00bctte,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the innkeeper said.

She died\nlast November.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDecember,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the sexton.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat makes nothing.

So to-day he\nbrought her in to be buried and the priest, when\nhe looked at her face, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to bury her.\nYou go on and tell it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to the sexton.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak German, not dialect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was very funny with the priest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nsexton. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the report to the commune she died\nof heart trouble. We knew she had heart\ntrouble here. She used to faint in church sometimes.\nShe did not come for a long time. She\nwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strong to climb.

Olz didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say anything.\nThe priest looked at him. Olz looked back at\nthe priest. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You want to know?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u0098I must know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the priest said.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the innkeeper said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen to this.
