His coat was wet too.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it raining?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack asks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pouring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe taxi I had,\ngot tied up in the traffic and I got out and\nwalked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on, play some cribbage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ought to go and eat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Jack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to eat yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSo they played cribbage for about half an\nhour and Jack won a dollar and a half off him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I suppose we got to go eat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack\nsays. He went to the window and looked out.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it still raining?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eat in the hotel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John says.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll play you once\nmore to see who pays for the meal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAfter a little while Jack gets up and says,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou buy the meal, John,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and we went downstairs\nand ate in the big dining-room.\nAfter we ate we went upstairs and Jack\nplayed cribbage with John again and won two\ndollars and a half off him. Jack was feeling\npretty good. John had a bag with him with all\nhis stuff in it. Jack took off his shirt and collar\nand put on a jersey and a sweater, so he\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch cold when he came out, and put\nhis ring clothes and his bathrobe in a bag.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou all ready?\u00e2\u0080\u009d John asks him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call\nup and have them get a taxi.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPretty soon the telephone rang and they said\nthe taxi was waiting.\nWe rode down in the elevator and went out\nthrough the lobby, and got in a taxi and rode\naround to the Garden. It was raining hard but\nthere was a lot of people outside on the streets.\nThe Garden was sold out. As we came in on our\nway to the dressing-room I saw how full it was.\nIt looked like half a mile down to the ring. It\nwas all dark. Just the lights over the ring.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good thing, with this rain, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ntry and pull this fight in the ball park,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John\nsaid.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey got a good crowd,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a fight that would draw a lot more\nthan the Garden could hold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell about the weather,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack\nsays.\nJohn came to the door of the dressing-room\nand poked his head in. Jack was sitting there\nwith his bathrobe on, he had his arms folded\nand was looking at the floor. John had a couple\nof handlers with him. They looked over his\nshoulder. Jack looked up.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs he in?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just gone down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John said.\nWe started down. Walcott was just getting\ninto the ring. The crowd gave him a big hand.\nHe climbed through between the ropes and put\nhis two fists together and smiled, and shook\nthem at the crowd, first at one side of the ring,\nthen at the other, and then sat down. Jack got\na good hand coming down through the crowd.\nJack is Irish and the Irish always get a pretty\ngood hand. An Irishman don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t draw in New\nYork like a Jew or an Italian but they always\nget a good hand. Jack climbed up and bent\ndown to go through the ropes and Walcott came\nover from his corner and pushed the rope down\nfor Jack to go through. The crowd thought\nthat was wonderful. Walcott put his hand on\nJack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder and they stood there just for\na second.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be one of these popular\nchampions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake your\ngoddam hand off my shoulder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walcott says.\nThis is all great for the crowd. How gentlemanly\nthe boys are before the fight! How\nthey wish each other luck!\nSolly Freedman came over to our corner\nwhile Jack is bandaging his hands and John is\nover in Walcott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corner. Jack puts his thumb\nthrough the slit in the bandage and then\nwrapped his hand nice and smooth. I taped it\naround the wrist and twice across the knuckles.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Freedman says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere do you\nget all that tape?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFeel of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soft, ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a hick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFreedman stands there all the time while\nJack bandages the other hand, and one of the\nboys that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to handle him brings the\ngloves and I pull them on and work them\naround.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay, Freedman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack asks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat nationality\nis this Walcott?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Solly says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some sort\nof a Dane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Bohemian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lad who brought the\ngloves said.\nThe referee called them out to the centre\nof the ring and Jack walks out. Walcott comes\nout smiling. They met and the referee put his\narm on each of their shoulders.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello, popularity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says to Walcott.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you call yourself \u00e2\u0080\u0098Walcott\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nJack says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know he was a nigger?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the referee, and he gives\nthem the same old line. Once Walcott interrupts\nhim. He grabs Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm and says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan\nI hit when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got me like this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep your hands off me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\nain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t no moving-pictures of this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThey went back to their corners. I lifted the\nbathrobe off Jack and he leaned on the ropes and\nflexed his knees a couple of times and scuffed\nhis shoes in the rosin. The gong rang and\nJack turned quick and went out. Walcott came\ntoward him and they touched gloves and as\nsoon as Walcott dropped his hands Jack jumped\nhis left into his face twice. There wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anybody\never boxed better than Jack. Walcott was\nafter him, going forward all the time with his\nchin on his chest. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hooker and he carries\nhis hands pretty low. All he knows is to\nget in there and sock. But every time he gets\nin there close, Jack has the left hand in his face.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automatic. Jack just\nraises the left hand up and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in Walcott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\nThree or four times Jack brings the right over\nbut Walcott gets it on the shoulder or high up\non the head. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like all these hookers.\nThe only thing he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s afraid of is another one of\nthe same kind. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s covered everywhere you\ncan hurt him. He don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about a left-hand\nin his face.\nAfter about four rounds Jack has him bleeding\nbad and his face all cut up, but every time\nWalcott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got in close he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s socked so hard he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngot two big red patches on both sides just below\nJack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ribs. Every time he gets in close, Jack\nties him up, then gets one hand loose and uppercuts\nhim, but when Walcott gets his hands\nloose he socks Jack in the body so they can hear\nit outside in the street. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a socker.\nIt goes along like that for three rounds more.\nThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk any. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working all the\ntime. We worked over Jack plenty too, in between\nthe rounds. He don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look good at all\nbut he never does much work in the ring. He\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move around much and that left-hand is\njust automatic. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like it was connected\nwith Walcott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face and Jack just had to wish\nit in every time. Jack is always calm in close\nand he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste any juice. He knows\neverything about working in close too and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngetting away with a lot of stuff. While they\nwere in our corner I watched him tie Walcott\nup, get his right hand loose, turn it and come\nup with an uppercut that got Walcott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose\nwith the heel of the glove. Walcott was bleeding\nbad and leaned his nose on Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder\nso as to give Jack some of it too, and Jack sort\nof lifted his shoulder sharp and caught him\nagainst the nose, and then brought down the\nright hand and did the same thing again.\nWalcott was sore as hell. By the time they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\ngone five rounds he hated Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guts. Jack\nwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sore; that is, he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any sorer than he\nalways was. He certainly did used to make the\nfellows he fought hate boxing. That was why\nhe hated Kid Lewis so. He never got the Kid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngoat. Kid Lewis always had about three new\ndirty things Jack couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do. Jack was as safe\nas a church all the time he was in there, as long\nas he was strong. He certainly was treating\nWalcott rough. The funny thing was it looked\nas though Jack was an open classic boxer. That\nwas because he had all that stuff too.\nAfter the seventh round Jack says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\nleft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting heavy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFrom then he started to take a beating. It\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show at first. But instead of him running\nthe fight it was Walcott was running it, instead\nof being safe all the time now he was in trouble.\nHe couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep him out with the left hand\nnow. It looked as though it was the same as\never, only now instead of Walcott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s punches\njust missing him they were just hitting him.\nHe took an awful beating in the body.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the round?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe eleventh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy legs are going\nbad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWalcott had been just hitting him for a long\ntime. It was like a baseball catcher pulls the\nball and takes some of the shock off. From\nnow on Walcott commenced to land solid. He\ncertainly was a socking-machine. Jack was just\ntrying to block everything now. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show\nwhat an awful beating he was taking. In between\nthe rounds I worked on his legs. The\nmuscles would flutter under my hands all the\ntime I was rubbing them. He was sick as hell.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked John, turning\naround, his face all swollen.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his fight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I can last,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want\nthis bohunk to stop me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIt was going just the way he thought it\nwould. He knew he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t beat Walcott. He\nwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strong any more. He was all right\nthough. His money was all right and now he\nwanted to finish it off right to please himself.\nHe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be knocked out.\nThe gong rang and we pushed him out. He\nwent out slow. Walcott came right out after\nhim. Jack put the left in his face and Walcott\ntook it, came in under it and started working on\nJack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. Jack tried to tie him up and it was\njust like trying to hold on to a buzz-saw. Jack\nbroke away from it and missed with the right.\nWalcott clipped him with a left-hook and Jack\nwent down. He went down on his hands and\nknees and looked at us. The referee started\ncounting. Jack was watching us and shaking his\nhead. At eight John motioned to him. You\ncouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear on account of the crowd. Jack\ngot up. The referee had been holding Walcott\nback with one arm while he counted.\nWhen Jack was on his feet Walcott started\ntoward him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWatch yourself, Jimmy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Solly\nFreedman yell to him.\nWalcott came up to Jack looking at him.\nJack stuck the left hand at him. Walcott just\nshook his head. He backed Jack up against the\nropes, measured him and then hooked the left\nvery light to the side of Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head and socked\nthe right into the body as hard as he could sock,\njust as low as he could get it. He must have\nhit him five inches below the belt. I thought\nthe eyes would come out of Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. They\nstuck way out. His mouth come open.\nThe referee grabbed Walcott. Jack stepped\nforward. If he went down there went fifty\nthousand bucks. He walked as though all his\ninsides were going to fall out.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t low,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a accident.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe crowd were yelling so you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear\nanything.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says. They were right\nin front of us. The referee looks at John and\nthen he shakes his head.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on, you polak son-of-a-bitch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack\nsays to Walcott.\nJohn was hanging onto the ropes. He had\nthe towel ready to chuck in. Jack was standing\njust a little way out from the ropes. He took\na step forward. I saw the sweat come out on his\nface like somebody had squeezed it and a big\ndrop went down his nose.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on and fight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack says to Walcott.\nThe referee looked at John and waved Walcott\non.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo in there, you slob,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nWalcott went in. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to\ndo either. He never thought Jack could have\nstood it. Jack put the left in his face. There\nwas such a hell of a lot of yelling going on.\nThey were right in front of us. Walcott hit\nhim twice. Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was the worst thing I\never saw,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the look on it! He was holding\nhimself and all his body together and it all\nshowed on his face. All the time he was thinking\nand holding his body in where it was busted.\nThen he started to sock. His face looked\nawful all the time. He started to sock with his\nhands low down by his side, swinging at Walcott.\nWalcott covered up and Jack was swinging\nwild at Walcott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. Then he swung the\nleft and it hit Walcott in the groin and the right\nhit Walcott right bang where he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hit Jack.\nWay low below the belt. Walcott went down\nand grabbed himself there and rolled and\ntwisted around.\nThe referee grabbed Jack and pushed him toward\nhis corner. John jumps into the ring.\nThere was all this yelling going on. The\nreferee was talking with the judges and then the\nannouncer got into the ring with the megaphone\nand says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWalcott on a foul.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe referee is talking to John and he says,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat could I do? Jack wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the\nfoul. Then when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groggy he fouls him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d lost it anyway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John says.\nJack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sitting on the chair. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got his gloves\noff and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s holding himself in down there with\nboth hands. When he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got something supporting\nit his face doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look so bad.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo over and say you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John says\ninto his ear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nJack stands up and the sweat comes out all\nover his face. I put the bathrobe around him\nand he holds himself in with one hand under\nthe bathrobe and goes across the ring.
