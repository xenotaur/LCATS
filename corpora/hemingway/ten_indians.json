He remembered there\nwere nine because Joe Garner, driving along in\nthe dusk, pulled up the horses, jumped down\ninto the road and dragged an Indian out of the\nwheel rut. The Indian had been asleep, face\ndown in the sand. Joe dragged him into the\nbushes and got back up on the wagon-box.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat makes nine of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joe said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust\nbetween here and the edge of town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThem Indians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Garner.\nNick was on the back seat with the two Garner\nboys.
