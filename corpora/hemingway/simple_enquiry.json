    "body": "Outside, the snow was higher than the window.\nThe sunlight came in through the window\nand shone on a map on the pine-board wall of\nthe hut. The sun was high and the light came\nin over the top of the snow. A trench had been\ncut along the open side of the hut, and each\nclear day the sun, shining on the wall, reflected\nheat against the snow and widened the trench.\nIt was late March. The major sat at a table\nagainst the wall. His adjutant sat at another\ntable.\nAround the major\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were two white\ncircles where his snow-glasses had protected his\nface from the sun on the snow. The rest of his\nface had been burned and then tanned and then\nburned through the tan. His nose was swollen\nand there were edges of loose skin where blisters\nhad been. While he worked at the papers\nhe put the fingers of his left hand into a saucer\nof oil and then spread the oil over his face,\ntouching it very gently with the tips of his fingers.\nHe was very careful to drain his fingers\non the edge of the saucer so there was only a\nfilm of oil on them, and after he had stroked\nhis forehead and his cheeks, he stroked his nose\nvery delicately between his fingers. When he\nhad finished he stood up, took the saucer of oil\nand went into the small room of the hut where\nhe slept. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to take a little sleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid to the adjutant. In that army an adjutant\nis not a commissioned officer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will finish\nup.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, signor maggiore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the adjutant answered.\nHe leaned back in his chair and\nyawned. He took a paper-covered book out of\nthe pocket of his coat and opened it; then laid\nit down on the table and lit his pipe. He leaned\nforward on the table to read and puffed at his\npipe. Then he closed the book and put it back\nin his pocket. He had too much paper-work to\nget through. He could not enjoy reading until\nit was done. Outside, the sun went behind a\nmountain and there was no more light on the\nwall of the hut. A soldier came in and put\nsome pine branches, chopped into irregular\nlengths, into the stove. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe soft, Pinin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the\nadjutant said to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe major is sleeping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPinin was the major\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orderly. He was a\ndark-faced boy, and he fixed the stove, putting\nthe pine wood in carefully, shut the door, and\nwent into the back of the hut again. The adjutant\nwent on with his papers.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTonani,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major called.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSignor maggiore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSend Pinin in to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPinin!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the adjutant called. Pinin came\ninto the room. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe major wants you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the\nadjutant said.\nPinin walked across the main room of the\nhut toward the major\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door. He knocked on\nthe half-opened door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSignor maggiore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the adjutant heard the major say,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand shut the door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nInside the room the major lay on his bunk.\nPinin stood beside the bunk. The major lay\nwith his head on the rucksack that he had\nstuffed with spare clothing to make a pillow.\nHis long, burned, oiled face looked at Pinin.\nHis hands lay on the blankets.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are nineteen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, signor maggiore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have ever been in love?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you mean, signor maggiore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn love\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a girl?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been with girls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not ask that. I asked if you had been\nin love\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, signor maggiore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are in love with this girl now? You\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write her. I read all your letters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am in love with her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pinin said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I\ndo not write her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are sure of this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTonani,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major said in the same tone\nof voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan you hear me talking?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThere was no answer from the next room.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe can not hear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nyou are quite sure that you love a girl?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major looked at him quickly,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you are not corrupt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you mean, corrupt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbe superior.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPinin looked at the floor. The major looked\nat his brown face, down and up him, and at his\nhands. Then he went on, not smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nyou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major paused.\nPinin looked at the floor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat your great desire\nisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pinin looked at the floor.\nThe major leaned his head back on the rucksack\nand smiled. He was really relieved: life in\nthe army was too complicated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a good\nboy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a good boy, Pinin. But\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be superior and be careful some one else\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come along and take you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPinin stood still beside the bunk.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major said. His hands\nwere folded on the blankets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch\nyou. You can go back to your platoon if you\nlike. But you had better stay on as my servant.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve less chance of being killed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you want anything of me, signor maggiore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the major said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on and get on\nwith whatever you were doing. Leave the door\nopen when you go out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPinin went out, leaving the door open. The\nadjutant looked up at him as he walked awkwardly\nacross the room and out the door. Pinin\nwas flushed and moved differently than he had\nmoved when he brought in the wood for the\nfire. The adjutant looked after him and smiled.\nPinin came in with more wood for the stove.\nThe major, lying on his bunk, looking at his\ncloth-covered helmet and his snow-glasses that\nhung from a nail on the wall, heard him walk\nacross the floor. The little devil, he thought,\nI wonder if he lied to me.",
