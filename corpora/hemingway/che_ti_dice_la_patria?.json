    "name": "Hemingway - Che Ti Dice La Patria?",
    "body": "The road of the pass was hard and smooth\nand not yet dusty in the early morning. Below\nwere the hills with oak and chestnut trees,\nand far away below was the sea. On the other\nside were snowy mountains.\nWe came down from the pass through\nwooded country. There were bags of charcoal\npiled beside the road, and through the trees\nwe saw charcoal-burners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 huts. It was Sunday\nand the road, rising and falling, but always\ndropping away from the altitude of the pass,\nwent through the scrub woods and through villages.\nOutside the villages there were fields with\nvines. The fields were brown and the vines\ncoarse and thick. The houses were white, and\nin the streets the men, in their Sunday clothes,\nwere playing bowls. Against the walls of some\nof the houses there were pear trees, their\nbranches candelabraed against the white walls.\nThe pear trees had been sprayed, and the walls\nof the houses were stained a metallic blue-green\nby the spray vapor. There were small\nclearings around the villages where the vines\ngrew, and then the woods.\nIn a village, twenty kilometres above Spezia,\nthere was a crowd in the square, and a young\nman carrying a suitcase came up to the car and\nasked us to take him in to Spezia.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are only two places, and they are occupied,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI said. We had an old Ford coup\u00c3\u00a9.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will ride on the outside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will be uncomfortable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat makes nothing. I must go to Spezia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShould we take him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked Guy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe seems to be going anyway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy said.\nThe young man handed in a parcel through the\nwindow.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook after this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Two men tied\nhis suitcase on the back of the car, above our\nsuitcases. He shook hands with every one, explained\nthat to a Fascist and a man as used to\ntravelling as himself there was no discomfort,\nand climbed up on the running-board on the\nleft-hand side of the car, holding on inside, his\nright arm through the open window.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can start,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The crowd waved.\nHe waved with his free hand.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did he say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy asked me.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat we could start.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he nice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy said.\nThe road followed a river. Across the river\nwere mountains. The sun was taking the frost\nout of the grass. It was bright and cold and\nthe air came cold through the open wind-shield.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you think he likes it out there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nGuy was looking up the road. His view out of\nhis side of the car was blocked by our guest.\nThe young man projected from the side of the\ncar like the figurehead of a ship. He had\nturned his coat collar up and pulled his hat\ndown and his nose looked cold in the wind.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get enough of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the side our bum tire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d leave us if we blew out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get his travelling-clothes dirty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cexcept\nthe way he leans out on the turns.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe woods were gone; the road had left the\nriver to climb; the radiator was boiling; the\nyoung man looked annoyedly and suspiciously\nat the steam and rusty water; the engine was\ngrinding, with both Guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet on the first-speed\npedal, up and up, back and forth and\nup, and, finally, out level. The grinding\nstopped, and in the new quiet there was a great\nchurning bubbling in the radiator. We were\nat the top of the last range above Spezia and\nthe sea. The road descended with short, barely\nrounded turns. Our guest hung out on the\nturns and nearly pulled the top-heavy car over.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell him not to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to Guy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his sense of self-preservation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe great Italian sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe greatest Italian sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWe came down around curves, through deep\ndust, the dust powdering the olive trees.\nSpezia spread below along the sea. The road\nflattened outside the town. Our guest put his\nhead in the window.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to stop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStop it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to Guy.\nWe slowed up, at the side of the road. The\nyoung man got down, went to the back of the\ncar and untied the suitcase.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI stop here, so you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get into trouble\ncarrying passengers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy package.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI handed him the package. He reached in\nhis pocket.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow much do I owe you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen thanks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man said, not\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cthank you very much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthank you a thousand times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d all of which you\nformerly said in Italy to a man when he handed\nyou a time-table or explained about a direction.\nThe young man uttered the lowest form of the\nword \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks\u00e2\u0080\u009d and looked after us suspiciously\nas Guy started the car. I waved my hand at\nhim. He was too dignified to reply. We went\non into Spezia.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a young man that will go a long way\nin Italy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to Guy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Guy, \u00e2\u0080\u009che went twenty kilometres\nwith us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nA MEAL IN SPEZIA\nWe came into Spezia looking for a place to\neat. The street was wide and the houses high\nand yellow. We followed the tram-track into\nthe centre of town. On the walls of the houses\nwere stencilled eye-bugging portraits of Mussolini,\nwith hand-painted \u00e2\u0080\u009cvivas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the double\nV in black paint with drippings of paint down\nthe wall. Side-streets went down to the harbor.\nIt was bright and the people were all out\nfor Sunday. The stone paving had been sprinkled\nand there were damp stretches in the dust.\nWe went close to the curb to avoid a tram.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eat somewhere simple,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy said.\nWe stopped opposite two restaurant signs.\nWe were standing across the street and I was\nbuying the papers. The two restaurants were\nside by side. A woman standing in the doorway\nof one smiled at us and we crossed the street\nand went in.\nIt was dark inside and at the back of the room\nthree girls were sitting at a table with an old\nwoman. Across from us, at another table, sat a\nsailor. He sat there neither eating nor drinking.\nFurther back, a young man in a blue suit\nwas writing at a table. His hair was pomaded\nand shining and he was very smartly dressed\nand clean-cut looking.\nThe light came through the doorway, and\nthrough the window where vegetables, fruit,\nsteaks, and chops were arranged in a show-case.\nA girl came and took our order and another\ngirl stood in the doorway. We noticed that she\nwore nothing under her house dress. The girl\nwho took our order put her arm around Guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nneck while we were looking at the menu. There\nwere three girls in all, and they all took turns\ngoing and standing in the doorway. The old\nwoman at the table in the back of the room\nspoke to them and they sat down again with\nher.\nThere was no doorway leading from the\nroom except into the kitchen. A curtain hung\nover it. The girl who had taken our order\ncame in from the kitchen with spaghetti. She\nput it on the table and brought a bottle of red\nwine and sat down at the table.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to Guy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou wanted to eat\nsome place simple.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t simple. This is complicated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the girl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre\nyou Germans?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSouth Germans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe South Germans\nare a gentle, lovable people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the mechanics of this place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy\nasked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo I have to let her put her arm\naround my neck?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMussolini has abolished\nthe brothels. This is a restaurant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe girl wore a one-piece dress. She\nleaned forward against the table and put her\nhands on her breasts and smiled. She smiled\nbetter on one side than on the other and turned\nthe good side toward us. The charm of the\ngood side had been enhanced by some event\nwhich had smoothed the other side of her nose\nin, as warm wax can be smoothed. Her nose,\nhowever, did not look like warm wax. It was\nvery cold and firmed, only smoothed in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nlike me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked Guy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe adores you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nspeak Italian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIch spreche Deutsch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, and stroked\nGuy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak to the lady in your native tongue,\nGuy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere do you come from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the lady.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPotsdam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you will stay here now for a little\nwhile?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this so dear Spezia?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell her we have to go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Guy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell\nher we are very ill, and have no money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friend is a misogynist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009can\nold German misogynist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell him I love him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI told him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you shut your mouth and get us out of\nhere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy said.

I told him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you get us out of here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are quarrelling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lady said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\ndo not love one another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are Germans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said proudly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cold\nSouth Germans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell him he is a beautiful boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lady\nsaid.

The property sailor\nsat with his head in his hands. No one had\nspoken to him all the time we were at lunch.\nThe girl brought us our change that the old\nwoman counted out for her and went back to\nher place at the table. We left a tip on the\ntable and went out. When we were seated in\nthe car ready to start, the girl came out and\nstood in the door. We started and I waved to\nher. She did not wave, but stood there looking\nafter us.\nAFTER THE RAIN\nIt was raining hard when we passed through\nthe suburbs of Genoa and, even going very\nslowly behind the tram-cars and the motor\ntrucks, liquid mud splashed on to the sidewalks,\nso that people stepped into doorways as they\nsaw us coming. In San Pier d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Arena, the industrial\nsuburb outside of Genoa, there is a wide\nstreet with two car-tracks and we drove down\nthe centre to avoid sending the mud on to the\nmen going home from work. On our left was\nthe Mediterranean. There was a big sea running\nand waves broke and the wind blew the\nspray against the car. A river-bed that, when\nwe had passed, going into Italy, had been wide,\nstony and dry, was running brown, and up to\nthe banks. The brown water discolored the\nsea and as the waves thinned and cleared in\nbreaking, the light came through the yellow\nwater and the crests, detached by the wind,\nblew across the road.\nA big car passed us, going fast, and a sheet of\nmuddy water rose up and over our wind-shield\nand radiator. The automatic wind-shield\ncleaner moved back and forth, spreading the\nfilm over the glass. We stopped and ate lunch\nat Sestri. There was no heat in the restaurant\nand we kept our hats and coats on. We could\nsee the car outside, through the window. It\nwas covered with mud and was stopped beside\nsome boats that had been pulled up beyond the\nwaves. In the restaurant you could see your\nbreath.\nThe pasta asciuta was good; the wine tasted\nof alum, and we poured water in it. Afterward\nthe waiter brought beefsteak and fried potatoes.\nA man and a woman sat at the far end of the\nrestaurant. He was middle-aged and she was\nyoung and wore black. All during the meal she\nwould blow out her breath in the cold damp\nair. The man would look at it and shake his\nhead. They ate without talking and the man\nheld her hand under the table. She was good-looking\nand they seemed very sad. They had\na travelling-bag with them.\nWe had the papers and I read the account of\nthe Shanghai fighting aloud to Guy. After the\nmeal, he left with the waiter in search for a\nplace which did not exist in the restaurant, and I\ncleaned off the wind-shield, the lights and the\nlicense plates with a rag. Guy came back and\nwe backed the car out and started. The waiter\nhad taken him across the road and into an old\nhouse. The people in the house were suspicious\nand the waiter had remained with Guy to see\nnothing was stolen.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how, me not being a\nplumber, they expected me to steal anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nGuy said.\nAs we came up on a headland beyond the\ntown, the wind struck the car and nearly tipped\nit over.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good it blows us away from the sea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nGuy said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey drowned Shelley somewhere\nalong here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was down by Viareggio,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you remember what we came to this country\nfor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be out of it to-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we can get past Ventimiglia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to drive this coast at\nnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was early afternoon and the sun was\nout. Below, the sea was blue with whitecaps\nrunning toward Savona. Back, beyond the cape,\nthe brown and blue waters joined. Out ahead\nof us, a tramp steamer was going up the coast.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you still see Genoa?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat next big cape ought to put it out of\nsight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see it a long time yet. I can still see\nPortofino Cape behind it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFinally we could not see Genoa. I looked\nback as we came out and there was only the sea,\nand below in the bay, a line of beach with fishing-boats\nand above, on the side of the hill, a\ntown and then capes far down the coast.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to Guy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been gone a long time now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be sure till we got way out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThere was a sign with a picture of an S-turn\nand Svolta Pericolosa. The road curved around\nthe headland and the wind blew through the\ncrack in the wind-shield. Below the cape was a\nflat stretch beside the sea. The wind had dried\nthe mud and the wheels were beginning to lift\ndust. On the flat road we passed a Fascist riding\na bicycle, a heavy revolver in a holster on\nhis back. He held the middle of the road on\nhis bicycle and we turned out for him. He\nlooked up at us as we passed. Ahead there was\na railway crossing, and as we came toward it\nthe gates went down.\nAs we waited, the Fascist came up on his bicycle.\nThe train went by and Guy started the\nengine.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the bicycle man shouted from behind\nthe car. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour number\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dirty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI got out with a rag. The number had been\ncleaned at lunch.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can read it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou think so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRead it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot read it. It is dirty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI wiped it off with the rag.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwenty-five lire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou could have read it.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only dirty from the state of the roads.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like Italian roads?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are dirty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty lire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He spat in the road. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour\ncar is dirty and you are dirty too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood. And give me a receipt with your\nname.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe took out a receipt-book, made in duplicate,\nand perforated, so one side could be given\nto the customer, and the other side filled in and\nkept as a stub. There was no carbon to record\nwhat the customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ticket said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me fifty lire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe wrote in indelible pencil, tore out the\nslip and handed it to me. I read it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is for twenty-five lire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA mistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, and changed the\ntwenty-five to fifty.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now the other side. Make it fifty in\nthe part you keep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe smiled a beautiful Italian smile and wrote\nsomething on the receipt stub, holding it so I\ncould not see.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore your number gets\ndirty again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWe drove for two hours after it was dark and\nslept in Mentone that night. It seemed very\ncheerful and clean and sane and lovely. We\nhad driven from Ventimiglia to Pisa and Florence,\nacross the Romagna to Rimini, back\nthrough Forli, Imola, Bologna, Parma, Piacenza\nand Genoa, to Ventimiglia again. The\nwhole trip had only taken ten days. Naturally,\nin such a short trip, we had no opportunity to\nsee how things were with the country or the\npeople.",
