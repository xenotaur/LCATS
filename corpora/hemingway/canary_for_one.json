    "name": "Hemingway - a Canary For One",
    "body": "The train passed very quickly a long, red\nstone house with a garden and four thick palm-trees\nwith tables under them in the shade. On\nthe other side was the sea. Then there was a\ncutting through red stone and clay, and the sea\nwas only occasionally and far below against\nrocks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI bought him in Palermo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the American\nlady said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe only had an hour ashore and it\nwas Sunday morning. The man wanted to be\npaid in dollars and I gave him a dollar and a\nhalf. He really sings very beautifully.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIt was very hot in the train and it was very\nhot in the lit salon compartment. There was no\nbreeze came through the open window. The\nAmerican lady pulled the window-blind down\nand there was no more sea, even occasionally.\nOn the other side there was glass, then the corridor,\nthen an open window, and outside the\nwindow were dusty trees and an oiled road and\nflat fields of grapes, with gray-stone hills behind\nthem.\nThere was smoke from many tall chimneys\u00e2\u0080\u0094coming\ninto Marseilles, and the train slowed\ndown and followed one track through many\nothers into the station. The train stayed twenty-five\nminutes in the station at Marseilles and the\nAmerican lady bought a copy of The Daily\nMail and a half-bottle of Evian water. She\nwalked a little way along the station platform,\nbut she stayed near the steps of the car because\nat Cannes, where it stopped for twelve minutes,\nthe train had left with no signal of departure\nand she had only gotten on just in time. The\nAmerican lady was a little deaf and she was\nafraid that perhaps signals of departure were\ngiven and that she did not hear them.\nThe train left the station in Marseilles and\nthere was not only the switch-yards and the factory\nsmoke but, looking back, the town of Marseilles\nand the harbor with stone hills behind it\nand the last of the sun on the water. As it was\ngetting dark the train passed a farmhouse burning\nin a field. Motor-cars were stopped along\nthe road and bedding and things from inside the\nfarmhouse were spread in the field. Many people\nwere watching the house burn. After it was\ndark the train was in Avignon. People got on\nand off. At the news-stand Frenchmen, returning\nto Paris, bought that day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s French papers.\nOn the station platform were negro soldiers.\nThey wore brown uniforms and were tall and\ntheir faces shone, close under the electric light.\nTheir faces were very black and they were too\ntall to stare. The train left Avignon station\nwith the negroes standing there. A short white\nsergeant was with them.\nInside the lit salon compartment the porter\nhad pulled down the three beds from inside the\nwall and prepared them for sleeping. In the\nnight the American lady lay without sleeping\nbecause the train was a rapide and went very\nfast and she was afraid of the speed in the night.\nThe American lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bed was the one next to\nthe window. The canary from Palermo, a\ncloth spread over his cage, was out of the draft\nin the corridor that went into the compartment\nwash-room. There was a blue light outside the\ncompartment, and all night the train went very\nfast and the American lady lay awake and\nwaited for a wreck.\nIn the morning the train was near Paris, and\nafter the American lady had come out from\nthe wash-room, looking very wholesome and\nmiddle-aged and American in spite of not having\nslept, and had taken the cloth off the birdcage\nand hung the cage in the sun, she went\nback to the restaurant-car for breakfast. When\nshe came back to the lit salon compartment\nagain, the beds had been pushed back into the\nwall and made into seats, the canary was shaking\nhis feathers in the sunlight that came\nthrough the open window, and the train was\nmuch nearer Paris.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe loves the sun,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the American lady said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sing now in a little while.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe canary shook his feathers and pecked\ninto them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always loved birds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the\nAmerican lady said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m taking him home to\nmy little girl. There\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s singing now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe canary chirped and the feathers on his\nthroat stood out, then he dropped his bill and\npecked into his feathers again. The train\ncrossed a river and passed through a very carefully\ntended forest. The train passed through\nmany outside of Paris towns. There were tram-cars\nin the towns and big advertisements for the\nBelle Jardini\u00c3\u00a8re and Dubonnet and Pernod on\nthe walls toward the train. All that the train\npassed through looked as though it were before\nbreakfast. For several minutes I had not listened\nto the American lady, who was talking to\nmy wife.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs your husband American too?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the\nlady.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my wife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both Americans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you were English.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps that was because I wore braces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nsaid. I had started to say suspenders and\nchanged it to braces in the mouth, to keep my\nEnglish character. The American lady did not\nhear. She was really quite deaf; she read lips,\nand I had not looked toward her. I had looked\nout of the window. She went on talking to my\nwife.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Americans. American\nmen make the best husbands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the American\nlady was saying. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was why we left the\nContinent, you know. My daughter fell in love\nwith a man in Vevey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She stopped. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\nwere simply madly in love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She stopped again.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI took her away, of course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid she get over it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked my wife.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the American lady.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat anything and she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsleep at all. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried so very hard, but she\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to take an interest in anything.\nShe doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about things. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have\nher marrying a foreigner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She paused. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome\none, a very good friend, told me once, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No\nforeigner can make an American girl a good\nhusband.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my wife, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe American lady admired my wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s travelling-coat,\nand it turned out that the American\nlady had bought her own clothes for twenty\nyears now from the same maison de couturier\nin the Rue Saint Honor\u00c3\u00a9. They had her measurements,\nand a vendeuse who knew her and\nher tastes picked the dresses out for her and\nthey were sent to America. They came to the\npost-office near where she lived up-town in New\nYork, and the duty was never exorbitant because\nthey opened the dresses there in the post-office\nto appraise them and they were always very\nsimple-looking and with no gold lace nor ornaments\nthat would make the dresses look expensive.\nBefore the present vendeuse, named\nTh\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se, there had been another vendeuse,\nnamed Am\u00c3\u00a9lie. Altogether there had only been\nthese two in the twenty years. It had always\nbeen the same couturier. Prices, however, had\ngone up. The exchange, though, equalized\nthat. They had her daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s measurements\nnow too. She was grown up and there was not\nmuch chance of their changing now.\nThe train was now coming into Paris. The\nfortifications were levelled but grass had not\ngrown. There were many cars standing on tracks\u00e2\u0080\u0094brown\nwooden restaurant-cars and brown\nwooden sleeping-cars that would go to Italy\nat five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock that night, if that train still left\nat five; the cars were marked Paris-Rome, and\ncars, with seats on the roofs, that went back\nand forth to the suburbs with, at certain hours,\npeople in all the seats and on the roofs, if that\nwere the way it were still done, and passing\nwere the white walls and many windows of\nhouses. Nothing had eaten any breakfast.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmericans make the best husbands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the\nAmerican lady said to my wife. I was getting\ndown the bags. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican men are the only\nmen in the world to marry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long ago did you leave Vevey?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked\nmy wife.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo years ago this fall. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her, you know,\nthat I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m taking the canary to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas the man your daughter was in love\nwith a Swiss?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the American lady. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was\nfrom a very good family in Vevey. He was going\nto be an engineer. They met there in Vevey.\nThey used to go on long walks together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know Vevey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my wife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were\nthere on our honeymoon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere you really? That must have been\nlovely. I had no idea, of course, that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d fall\nin love with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a very lovely place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my wife.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the American lady. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it\nlovely? Where did you stop there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe stayed at the Trois Couronnes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nmy wife.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a fine old hotel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the American\nlady.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my wife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had a very fine\nroom and in the fall the country was lovely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere you there in the fall?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my wife.\nWe were passing three cars that had been in\na wreck. They were splintered open and the\nroofs sagged in.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a wreck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe American lady looked and saw the last\ncar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was afraid of just that all night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have terrific presentiments about things\nsometimes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never travel on a rapide again\nat night. There must be other comfortable\ntrains that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go so fast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThen the train was in the dark of the Gare\nde Lyons, and then stopped and porters came up\nto the windows. I handed bags through the\nwindows, and we were out on the dim longness\nof the platform, and the American lady put\nherself in charge of one of three men from\nCook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust a moment, madame, and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look for your name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe porter brought a truck and piled on the\nbaggage, and my wife said good-by and I said\ngood-by to the American lady, whose name had\nbeen found by the man from Cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on a typewritten\npage in a sheaf of typewritten pages\nwhich he replaced in his pocket.\nWe followed the porter with the truck down\nthe long cement platform beside the train. At\nthe end was a gate and a man took the tickets.\nWe were returning to Paris to set up separate\nresidences.",
