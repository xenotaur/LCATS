The\nthree Roman soldiers are a little cock-eyed.\n\n1st Roman SoldierâYou tried the red?\n2d SoldierâNo, I ainât tried it.\n1st SoldierâYou better try it.\n2d SoldierâAll right, George, weâll have a\nround of the red.\nHebrew Wine-sellerâHere you are, gentlemen.\nYouâll like that. [He sets down an\nearthenware pitcher that he has filled from one\nof the casks.] Thatâs a nice little wine.\n1st SoldierâHave a drink of it yourself.\n[He turns to the third Roman soldier who is\nleaning on a barrel.] Whatâs the matter with\nyou?\n3d Roman SoldierâI got a gut-ache.\n2d SoldierâYouâve been drinking water.\n1st SoldierâTry some of the red.\n3d SoldierâI canât drink the damn stuff. It\nmakes my gut sour.\n1st SoldierâYou been out here too long.\n3d SoldierâHell, donât I know it?\n1st SoldierâSay, George, canât you give this\ngentleman something to fix up his stomach?\nHebrew Wine-sellerâI got it right here.\n\n[The third Roman soldier tastes the cup\nthat the wine-seller has mixed for him.]\n\n3d SoldierâHey, what you put in that,\ncamel chips?\nWine-sellerâYou drink that right down,\nLootenant. Thatâll fix you up right.\n3d SoldierâWell, I couldnât feel any worse.\n1st SoldierâTake a chance on it. George\nfixed me up fine the other day.\nWine-sellerâYou were in bad shape, Lootenant.\nI know what fixes up a bad stomach.\n\n[The third Roman soldier drinks the cup\ndown.]\n\n3d Roman SoldierâJesus Christ. [He makes\na face.]\n2d SoldierâThat false alarm!\n1st SoldierâOh, I donât know. He was\npretty good in there to-day.\n2d SoldierâWhy didnât he come down off\nthe cross?\n1st SoldierâHe didnât want to come down\noff the cross. Thatâs not his play.\n2d SoldierâShow me a guy that doesnât want\nto come down off the cross.\n1st SoldierâAw, hell, you donât know anything\nabout it. Ask George there. Did he\nwant to come down off the cross, George?\nWine-sellerâIâll tell you, gentlemen, I\nwasnât out there. Itâs a thing I havenât taken\nany interest in.\n2d SoldierâListen, I seen a lot of themâhere\nand plenty of other places. Any time\nyou show me one that doesnât want to get down\noff the cross when the time comesâwhen the\ntime comes, I meanâIâll climb right up with\nhim.\n1st SoldierâI thought he was pretty good in\nthere to-day.\n3d SoldierâHe was all right.\n2d Roman SoldierâYou guys donât know\nwhat Iâm talking about. Iâm not saying\nwhether he was good or not. What I mean is,\nwhen the time comes. When they first start\nnailing him, there isnât none of them wouldnât\nstop it if they could.\n1st SoldierâDidnât you follow it, George?\nWine-sellerâNo, I didnât take any interest\nin it, Lootenant.\n1st SoldierâI was surprised how he acted.\n3d SoldierâThe part I donât like is the nailing\nthem on. You know, that must get to you\npretty bad.\n2d SoldierâIt isnât that thatâs so bad, as\nwhen they first lift âem up. [He makes a lifting\ngesture with his two palms together.] When\nthe weight starts to pull on âem. Thatâs when\nit gets âem.\n3d Roman SoldierâIt takes some of them\npretty bad.\n1st SoldierâAinât I seen âem? I seen plenty\nof them. I tell you, he was pretty good in there\nto-day.\n\n[The second Roman soldier smiles at the\nHebrew wine-seller.]\n\n2d SoldierâYouâre a regular Christer, big\nboy.\n1st SoldierâSure, go on and kid him. But\nlisten while I tell you something. He was\npretty good in there to-day.\n2d SoldierâWhat about some more wine?\n\n[The wine-seller looks up expectantly.\nThe third Roman soldier is sitting with his\nhead down. He does not look well.]\n\n3d SoldierâI donât want any more.\n2d SoldierâJust for two, George.\n\n[The wine-seller puts out a pitcher of\nwine, a size smaller than the last one. He\nleans forward on the wooden counter.]\n\n1st Roman SoldierâYou see his girl?\n2d SoldierâWasnât I standing right by her?\n1st SoldierâSheâs a nice-looker.\n2d SoldierâI knew her before he did. [He\nwinks at the wine-seller.]\n1st SoldierâI used to see her around the\ntown.\n2d SoldierâShe used to have a lot of stuff.\nHe never brought her no good luck.\n1st SoldierâOh, he ainât lucky. But he\nlooked pretty good to me in there to-day.\n2d SoldierâWhat become of his gang?\n1st SoldierâOh, they faded out. Just the\nwomen stuck by him.\n2d Roman SoldierâThey were a pretty yellow\ncrowd. When they seen him go up there\nthey didnât want any of it.\n1st SoldierâThe women stuck all right.\n2d SoldierâSure, they stuck all right.\n1st Roman SoldierâYou see me slip the old\nspear into him?\n2d Roman SoldierâYouâll get into trouble\ndoing that some day.\n1st SoldierâIt was the least I could do for\nhim. Iâll tell you he looked pretty good to me\nin there to-day.\nHebrew Wine-sellerâGentlemen, you know\nI got to close.\n1st Roman SoldierâWeâll have one more\nround.\n2d Roman SoldierâWhatâs the use? This\nstuff donât get you anywhere. Come on, letâs\ngo.\n1st SoldierâJust another round.\n3d Roman Soldierâ[Getting up from the\nbarrel.] No, come on. Letâs go. I feel like\nhell to-night.\n1st SoldierâJust one more.\n2d SoldierâNo, come on. Weâre going to\ngo. Good-night, George. Put it on the bill.\nWine-sellerâGood-night, gentlemen. [He\nlooks a little worried.] You couldnât let me\nhave a little something on account, Lootenant?\n2d Roman SoldierâWhat the hell, George!\nWednesdayâs pay-day.\nWine-sellerâItâs all right, Lootenant. Good-night,\ngentlemen.\n\n[The three Roman soldiers go out the\ndoor into the street.]\n[Outside in the street.]\n\n2d Roman SoldierâGeorge is a kike just like\nall the rest of them.\n1st Roman SoldierâOh, George is a nice\nfella.\n2d SoldierâEverybodyâs a nice fella to you\nto-night.\n3d Roman SoldierâCome on, letâs go up to\nthe barracks. I feel like hell to-night.\n2d SoldierâYou been out here too long.\n3d Roman SoldierâNo, it ainât just that.\nI feel like hell.\n2d SoldierâYou been out here too long.\nThatâs all.\nCurtain.",
