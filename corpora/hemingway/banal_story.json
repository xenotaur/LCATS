Outside, the snow was turning to rain.\nInside, the electric stove seemed to give no heat\nand rising from his writing-table, he sat down\nupon the stove. How good it felt! Here, at\nlast, was life.\nHe reached for another orange. Far away\nin Paris, Mascart had knocked Danny Frush\ncuckoo in the second round. Far off in Mesopotamia,\ntwenty-one feet of snow had fallen.\nAcross the world in distant Australia, the English\ncricketers were sharpening up their wickets.\nThere was Romance.\nPatrons of the arts and letters have discovered\nThe Forum, he read. It is the guide,\nphilosopher, and friend of the thinking minority.\nPrize short-stories\u00e2\u0080\u0094will their authors write\nour best-sellers of to-morrow?\nYou will enjoy these warm, homespun,\nAmerican tales, bits of real life on the open\nranch, in crowded tenement or comfortable\nhome, and all with a healthy undercurrent of\nhumor.\nI must read them, he thought.\nHe read on. Our children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children\u00e2\u0080\u0094what\nof them? Who of them? New means must\nbe discovered to find room for us under the\nsun. Shall this be done by war or can it be\ndone by peaceful methods?\nOr will we all have to move to Canada?\nOur deepest convictions\u00e2\u0080\u0094will Science upset\nthem? Our civilization\u00e2\u0080\u0094is it inferior to older\norders of things?\nAnd meanwhile, in the far-off dripping jungles\nof Yucatan, sounded the chopping of the\naxes of the gum-choppers.\nDo we want big men\u00e2\u0080\u0094or do we want them\ncultured? Take Joyce. Take President Coolidge.\nWhat star must our college students aim\nat? There is Jack Britton. There is Dr. Henry\nVan Dyke. Can we reconcile the two? Take\nthe case of Young Stribling.\nAnd what of our daughters who must make\ntheir own Soundings? Nancy Hawthorne is\nobliged to make her own Soundings in the sea\nof life. Bravely and sensibly she faces the\nproblems which come to every girl of eighteen.\nIt was a splendid booklet.\nAre you a girl of eighteen? Take the case\nof Joan of Arc. Take the case of Bernard\nShaw. Take the case of Betsy Ross.\nThink of these things in 1925\u00e2\u0080\u0094Was there a\nrisqu\u00c3\u00a9 page in Puritan history? Were there\ntwo sides to Pocahontas? Did he have a fourth\ndimension?\nAre modern paintings\u00e2\u0080\u0094and poetry\u00e2\u0080\u0094Art?\nYes and No. Take Picasso.\nHave tramps codes of conduct? Send your\nmind adventuring.\nThere is Romance everywhere. Forum\nwriters talk to the point, are possessed of humor\nand wit. But they do not try to be smart and\nare never long-winded.\nLive the full life of the mind, exhilarated by\nnew ideas, intoxicated by the Romance of the\nunusual. He laid down the booklet.\nAnd meanwhile, stretched flat on a bed in a\ndarkened room in his house in Triana, Manuel\nGarcia Maera lay with a tube in each lung,\ndrowning with the pneumonia. All the papers\nin Andalucia devoted special supplements to his\ndeath, which had been expected for some days.\nMen and boys bought full-length colored pictures\nof him to remember him by, and lost the\npicture they had of him in their memories by\nlooking at the lithographs. Bull-fighters were\nvery relieved he was dead, because he did always\nin the bull-ring the things they could only do\nsometimes. They all marched in the rain behind\nhis coffin and there were one hundred and\nforty-seven bull-fighters followed him out to\nthe cemetery, where they buried him in the\ntomb next to Joselito. After the funeral every\none sat in the caf\u00c3\u00a9s out of the rain, and many\ncolored pictures of Maera were sold to men\nwho rolled them up and put them away in their\npockets.",
