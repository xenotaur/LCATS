    "body": "They limped painfully down the bank, and once the foremost of\nthe two men staggered among the rough-strewn rocks.\u00c2\u00a0 They\nwere tired and weak, and their faces had the drawn expression of\npatience which comes of hardship long endured.\u00c2\u00a0 They were\nheavily burdened with blanket packs which were strapped to their\nshoulders.\u00c2\u00a0 Head-straps, passing across the forehead, helped\nsupport these packs.\u00c2\u00a0 Each man carried a rifle.\u00c2\u00a0 They\nwalked in a stooped posture, the shoulders well forward, the head\nstill farther forward, the eyes bent upon the ground.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish we had just about two of them cartridges\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s layin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in that cache of ourn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nsecond man.\nHis voice was utterly and drearily expressionless.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nspoke without enthusiasm; and the first man, limping into the\nmilky stream that foamed over the rocks, vouchsafed no reply.\nThe other man followed at his heels.\u00c2\u00a0 They did not remove\ntheir foot-gear, though the water was icy cold\u00e2\u0080\u0094so cold that\ntheir ankles ached and their feet went numb.\u00c2\u00a0 In places the\nwater dashed against their knees, and both men staggered for\nfooting.\nThe man who followed slipped on a smooth boulder, nearly fell,\nbut recovered himself with a violent effort, at the same time\nuttering a sharp exclamation of pain.\u00c2\u00a0 He seemed faint and\ndizzy and put out his free hand while he reeled, as though\nseeking support against the air.\u00c2\u00a0 When he had steadied\nhimself he stepped forward, but reeled again and nearly\nfell.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he stood still and looked at the other man, who\nhad never turned his head.\nThe man stood still for fully a minute, as though debating\nwith himself.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he called out:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, Bill, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve sprained my ankle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBill staggered on through the milky water.\u00c2\u00a0 He did not\nlook around.\u00c2\u00a0 The man watched him go, and though his face\nwas expressionless as ever, his eyes were like the eyes of a\nwounded deer.\nThe other man limped up the farther bank and continued\nstraight on without looking back.\u00c2\u00a0 The man in the stream\nwatched him.\u00c2\u00a0 His lips trembled a little, so that the rough\nthatch of brown hair which covered them was visibly\nagitated.\u00c2\u00a0 His tongue even strayed out to moisten them.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBill!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried out.\nIt was the pleading cry of a strong man in distress, but\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head did not turn.\u00c2\u00a0 The man watched him go,\nlimping grotesquely and lurching forward with stammering gait up\nthe slow slope toward the soft sky-line of the low-lying\nhill.\u00c2\u00a0 He watched him go till he passed over the crest and\ndisappeared.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he turned his gaze and slowly took in the\ncircle of the world that remained to him now that Bill was\ngone.\nNear the horizon the sun was smouldering dimly, almost\nobscured by formless mists and vapors, which gave an impression\nof mass and density without outline or tangibility.\u00c2\u00a0 The man\npulled out his watch, the while resting his weight on one\nleg.\u00c2\u00a0 It was four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and as the season was near\nthe last of July or first of August,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he did not know the\nprecise date within a week or two,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he knew that the sun\nroughly marked the northwest.\u00c2\u00a0 He looked to the south and\nknew that somewhere beyond those bleak hills lay the Great Bear\nLake; also, he knew that in that direction the Arctic Circle cut\nits forbidding way across the Canadian Barrens.\u00c2\u00a0 This stream\nin which he stood was a feeder to the Coppermine River, which in\nturn flowed north and emptied into Coronation Gulf and the Arctic\nOcean.\u00c2\u00a0 He had never been there, but he had seen it, once,\non a Hudson Bay Company chart.\nAgain his gaze completed the circle of the world about\nhim.\u00c2\u00a0 It was not a heartening spectacle.\u00c2\u00a0 Everywhere\nwas soft sky-line.\u00c2\u00a0 The hills were all low-lying.\u00c2\u00a0\nThere were no trees, no shrubs, no grasses\u00e2\u0080\u0094naught but a\ntremendous and terrible desolation that sent fear swiftly dawning\ninto his eyes.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBill!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered, once and twice;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBill!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe cowered in the midst of the milky water, as though the\nvastness were pressing in upon him with overwhelming force,\nbrutally crushing him with its complacent awfulness.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nbegan to shake as with an ague-fit, till the gun fell from his\nhand with a splash.\u00c2\u00a0 This served to rouse him.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nfought with his fear and pulled himself together, groping in the\nwater and recovering the weapon.\u00c2\u00a0 He hitched his pack\nfarther over on his left shoulder, so as to take a portion of its\nweight from off the injured ankle.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he proceeded,\nslowly and carefully, wincing with pain, to the bank.\nHe did not stop.\u00c2\u00a0 With a desperation that was madness,\nunmindful of the pain, he hurried up the slope to the crest of\nthe hill over which his comrade had disappeared\u00e2\u0080\u0094more\ngrotesque and comical by far than that limping, jerking\ncomrade.\u00c2\u00a0 But at the crest he saw a shallow valley, empty of\nlife.\u00c2\u00a0 He fought with his fear again, overcame it, hitched\nthe pack still farther over on his left shoulder, and lurched on\ndown the slope.\nThe bottom of the valley was soggy with water, which the thick\nmoss held, spongelike, close to the surface.\u00c2\u00a0 This water\nsquirted out from under his feet at every step, and each time he\nlifted a foot the action culminated in a sucking sound as the wet\nmoss reluctantly released its grip.\u00c2\u00a0 He picked his way from\nmuskeg to muskeg, and followed the other man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footsteps\nalong and across the rocky ledges which thrust like islets\nthrough the sea of moss.\nThough alone, he was not lost.\u00c2\u00a0 Farther on he knew he\nwould come to where dead spruce and fir, very small and weazened,\nbordered the shore of a little lake, the titchin-nichilie,\nin the tongue of the country, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cland of little\nsticks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 And into that lake flowed a small stream,\nthe water of which was not milky.\u00c2\u00a0 There was rush-grass on\nthat stream\u00e2\u0080\u0094this he remembered well\u00e2\u0080\u0094but no timber,\nand he would follow it till its first trickle ceased at a\ndivide.\u00c2\u00a0 He would cross this divide to the first trickle of\nanother stream, flowing to the west, which he would follow until\nit emptied into the river Dease, and here he would find a cache\nunder an upturned canoe and piled over with many rocks.\u00c2\u00a0 And\nin this cache would be ammunition for his empty gun, fish-hooks\nand lines, a small net\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the utilities for the killing\nand snaring of food.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, he would find flour,\u00e2\u0080\u0094not\nmuch,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a piece of bacon, and some beans.\nBill would be waiting for him there, and they would paddle\naway south down the Dease to the Great Bear Lake.\u00c2\u00a0 And south\nacross the lake they would go, ever south, till they gained the\nMackenzie.\u00c2\u00a0 And south, still south, they would go, while the\nwinter raced vainly after them, and the ice formed in the eddies,\nand the days grew chill and crisp, south to some warm Hudson Bay\nCompany post, where timber grew tall and generous and there was\ngrub without end.\nThese were the thoughts of the man as he strove onward.\u00c2\u00a0\nBut hard as he strove with his body, he strove equally hard with\nhis mind, trying to think that Bill had not deserted him, that\nBill would surely wait for him at the cache.\u00c2\u00a0 He was\ncompelled to think this thought, or else there would not be any\nuse to strive, and he would have lain down and died.\u00c2\u00a0 And as\nthe dim ball of the sun sank slowly into the northwest he covered\nevery inch\u00e2\u0080\u0094and many times\u00e2\u0080\u0094of his and Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nflight south before the downcoming winter.\u00c2\u00a0 And he conned\nthe grub of the cache and the grub of the Hudson Bay Company post\nover and over again.\u00c2\u00a0 He had not eaten for two days; for a\nfar longer time he had not had all he wanted to eat.\u00c2\u00a0 Often\nhe stooped and picked pale muskeg berries, put them into his\nmouth, and chewed and swallowed them.\u00c2\u00a0 A muskeg berry is a\nbit of seed enclosed in a bit of water.\u00c2\u00a0 In the mouth the\nwater melts away and the seed chews sharp and bitter.\u00c2\u00a0 The\nman knew there was no nourishment in the berries, but he chewed\nthem patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and defying\nexperience.\nAt nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock he stubbed his toe on a rocky ledge, and\nfrom sheer weariness and weakness staggered and fell.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nlay for some time, without movement, on his side.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he\nslipped out of the pack-straps and clumsily dragged himself into\na sitting posture.\u00c2\u00a0 It was not yet dark, and in the\nlingering twilight he groped about among the rocks for shreds of\ndry moss.\u00c2\u00a0 When he had gathered a heap he built a\nfire,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a smouldering, smudgy fire,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and put a tin pot\nof water on to boil.\nHe unwrapped his pack and the first thing he did was to count\nhis matches.\u00c2\u00a0 There were sixty-seven.\u00c2\u00a0 He counted them\nthree times to make sure.\u00c2\u00a0 He divided them into several\nportions, wrapping them in oil paper, disposing of one bunch in\nhis empty tobacco pouch, of another bunch in the inside band of\nhis battered hat, of a third bunch under his shirt on the\nchest.\u00c2\u00a0 This accomplished, a panic came upon him, and he\nunwrapped them all and counted them again.\u00c2\u00a0 There were still\nsixty-seven.\nHe dried his wet foot-gear by the fire.\u00c2\u00a0 The moccasins\nwere in soggy shreds.\u00c2\u00a0 The blanket socks were worn through\nin places, and his feet were raw and bleeding.\u00c2\u00a0 His ankle\nwas throbbing, and he gave it an examination.\u00c2\u00a0 It had\nswollen to the size of his knee.\u00c2\u00a0 He tore a long strip from\none of his two blankets and bound the ankle tightly.\u00c2\u00a0 He\ntore other strips and bound them about his feet to serve for both\nmoccasins and socks.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he drank the pot of water,\nsteaming hot, wound his watch, and crawled between his\nblankets.\nHe slept like a dead man.\u00c2\u00a0 The brief darkness around\nmidnight came and went.\u00c2\u00a0 The sun arose in the\nnortheast\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least the day dawned in that quarter, for the\nsun was hidden by gray clouds.\nAt six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock he awoke, quietly lying on his\nback.\u00c2\u00a0 He gazed straight up into the gray sky and knew that\nhe was hungry.\u00c2\u00a0 As he rolled over on his elbow he was\nstartled by a loud snort, and saw a bull caribou regarding him\nwith alert curiosity.\u00c2\u00a0 The animal was not mere than fifty\nfeet away, and instantly into the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind leaped the\nvision and the savor of a caribou steak sizzling and frying over\na fire.\u00c2\u00a0 Mechanically he reached for the empty gun, drew a\nbead, and pulled the trigger.\u00c2\u00a0 The bull snorted and leaped\naway, his hoofs rattling and clattering as he fled across the\nledges.\nThe man cursed and flung the empty gun from him.\u00c2\u00a0 He\ngroaned aloud as he started to drag himself to his feet.\u00c2\u00a0 It\nwas a slow and arduous task.\nHis joints were like rusty hinges.\u00c2\u00a0 They worked harshly\nin their sockets, with much friction, and each bending or\nunbending was accomplished only through a sheer exertion of\nwill.\u00c2\u00a0 When he finally gained his feet, another minute or so\nwas consumed in straightening up, so that he could stand erect as\na man should stand.\nHe crawled up a small knoll and surveyed the prospect.\u00c2\u00a0\nThere were no trees, no bushes, nothing but a gray sea of moss\nscarcely diversified by gray rocks, gray lakelets, and gray\nstreamlets.\u00c2\u00a0 The sky was gray.\u00c2\u00a0 There was no sun nor\nhint of sun.\u00c2\u00a0 He had no idea of north, and he had forgotten\nthe way he had come to this spot the night before.\u00c2\u00a0 But he\nwas not lost.\u00c2\u00a0 He knew that.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon he would come to the\nland of the little sticks.\u00c2\u00a0 He felt that it lay off to the\nleft somewhere, not far\u00e2\u0080\u0094possibly just over the next low\nhill.\nHe went back to put his pack into shape for travelling.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe assured himself of the existence of his three separate parcels\nof matches, though he did not stop to count them.\u00c2\u00a0 But he\ndid linger, debating, over a squat moose-hide sack.\u00c2\u00a0 It was\nnot large.\u00c2\u00a0 He could hide it under his two hands.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nknew that it weighed fifteen pounds,\u00e2\u0080\u0094as much as all the\nrest of the pack,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it worried him.\u00c2\u00a0 He finally set\nit to one side and proceeded to roll the pack.\u00c2\u00a0 He paused to\ngaze at the squat moose-hide sack.\u00c2\u00a0 He picked it up hastily\nwith a defiant glance about him, as though the desolation were\ntrying to rob him of it; and when he rose to his feet to stagger\non into the day, it was included in the pack on his back.\nHe bore away to the left, stopping now and again to eat muskeg\nberries.\u00c2\u00a0 His ankle had stiffened, his limp was more\npronounced, but the pain of it was as nothing compared with the\npain of his stomach.\u00c2\u00a0 The hunger pangs were sharp.\u00c2\u00a0\nThey gnawed and gnawed until he could not keep his mind steady on\nthe course he must pursue to gain the land of little\nsticks.\u00c2\u00a0 The muskeg berries did not allay this gnawing,\nwhile they made his tongue and the roof of his mouth sore with\ntheir irritating bite.\nHe came upon a valley where rock ptarmigan rose on whirring\nwings from the ledges and muskegs.\u00c2\u00a0 Ker\u00e2\u0080\u0094ker\u00e2\u0080\u0094ker\nwas the cry they made.\u00c2\u00a0 He threw stones at them, but could\nnot hit them.\u00c2\u00a0 He placed his pack on the ground and stalked\nthem as a cat stalks a sparrow.\u00c2\u00a0 The sharp rocks cut through\nhis pants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 legs till his knees left a trail of blood; but\nthe hurt was lost in the hurt of his hunger.\u00c2\u00a0 He squirmed\nover the wet moss, saturating his clothes and chilling his body;\nbut he was not aware of it, so great was his fever for\nfood.\u00c2\u00a0 And always the ptarmigan rose, whirring, before him,\ntill their ker\u00e2\u0080\u0094ker\u00e2\u0080\u0094ker became a mock to him, and he\ncursed them and cried aloud at them with their own cry.\nOnce he crawled upon one that must have been asleep.\u00c2\u00a0 He\ndid not see it till it shot up in his face from its rocky\nnook.\u00c2\u00a0 He made a clutch as startled as was the rise of the\nptarmigan, and there remained in his hand three\ntail-feathers.\u00c2\u00a0 As he watched its flight he hated it, as\nthough it had done him some terrible wrong.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he\nreturned and shouldered his pack.\nAs the day wore along he came into valleys or swales where\ngame was more plentiful.\u00c2\u00a0 A band of caribou passed by,\ntwenty and odd animals, tantalizingly within rifle range.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe felt a wild desire to run after them, a certitude that he\ncould run them down.\u00c2\u00a0 A black fox came toward him, carrying\na ptarmigan in his mouth.\u00c2\u00a0 The man shouted.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a\nfearful cry, but the fox, leaping away in fright, did not drop\nthe ptarmigan.\nLate in the afternoon he followed a stream, milky with lime,\nwhich ran through sparse patches of rush-grass.\u00c2\u00a0 Grasping\nthese rushes firmly near the root, he pulled up what resembled a\nyoung onion-sprout no larger than a shingle-nail.\u00c2\u00a0 It was\ntender, and his teeth sank into it with a crunch that promised\ndeliciously of food.\u00c2\u00a0 But its fibers were tough.\u00c2\u00a0 It\nwas composed of stringy filaments saturated with water, like the\nberries, and devoid of nourishment.\u00c2\u00a0 He threw off his pack\nand went into the rush-grass on hands and knees, crunching and\nmunching, like some bovine creature.\nHe was very weary and often wished to rest\u00e2\u0080\u0094to lie down\nand sleep; but he was continually driven on\u00e2\u0080\u0094not so much by\nhis desire to gain the land of little sticks as by his\nhunger.\u00c2\u00a0 He searched little ponds for frogs and dug up the\nearth with his nails for worms, though he knew in spite that\nneither frogs nor worms existed so far north.\nHe looked into every pool of water vainly, until, as the long\ntwilight came on, he discovered a solitary fish, the size of a\nminnow, in such a pool.\u00c2\u00a0 He plunged his arm in up to the\nshoulder, but it eluded him.\u00c2\u00a0 He reached for it with both\nhands and stirred up the milky mud at the bottom.\u00c2\u00a0 In his\nexcitement he fell in, wetting himself to the waist.\u00c2\u00a0 Then\nthe water was too muddy to admit of his seeing the fish, and he\nwas compelled to wait until the sediment had settled.\nThe pursuit was renewed, till the water was again\nmuddied.\u00c2\u00a0 But he could not wait.\u00c2\u00a0 He unstrapped the tin\nbucket and began to bale the pool.\u00c2\u00a0 He baled wildly at\nfirst, splashing himself and flinging the water so short a\ndistance that it ran back into the pool.\u00c2\u00a0 He worked more\ncarefully, striving to be cool, though his heart was pounding\nagainst his chest and his hands were trembling.\u00c2\u00a0 At the end\nof half an hour the pool was nearly dry.\u00c2\u00a0 Not a cupful of\nwater remained.\u00c2\u00a0 And there was no fish.\u00c2\u00a0 He found a\nhidden crevice among the stones through which it had escaped to\nthe adjoining and larger pool\u00e2\u0080\u0094a pool which he could not\nempty in a night and a day.\u00c2\u00a0 Had he known of the crevice, he\ncould have closed it with a rock at the beginning and the fish\nwould have been his.\nThus he thought, and crumpled up and sank down upon the wet\nearth.\u00c2\u00a0 At first he cried softly to himself, then he cried\nloudly to the pitiless desolation that ringed him around; and for\na long time after he was shaken by great dry sobs.\nHe built a fire and warmed himself by drinking quarts of hot\nwater, and made camp on a rocky ledge in the same fashion he had\nthe night before.\u00c2\u00a0 The last thing he did was to see that his\nmatches were dry and to wind his watch.\u00c2\u00a0 The blankets were\nwet and clammy.\u00c2\u00a0 His ankle pulsed with pain.\u00c2\u00a0 But he\nknew only that he was hungry, and through his restless sleep he\ndreamed of feasts and banquets and of food served and spread in\nall imaginable ways.\nHe awoke chilled and sick.\u00c2\u00a0 There was no sun.\u00c2\u00a0 The\ngray of earth and sky had become deeper, more profound.\u00c2\u00a0 A\nraw wind was blowing, and the first flurries of snow were\nwhitening the hilltops.\u00c2\u00a0 The air about him thickened and\ngrew white while he made a fire and boiled more water.\u00c2\u00a0 It\nwas wet snow, half rain, and the flakes were large and\nsoggy.\u00c2\u00a0 At first they melted as soon as they came in contact\nwith the earth, but ever more fell, covering the ground, putting\nout the fire, spoiling his supply of moss-fuel.\nThis was a signal for him to strap on his pack and stumble\nonward, he knew not where.\u00c2\u00a0 He was not concerned with the\nland of little sticks, nor with Bill and the cache under the\nupturned canoe by the river Dease.\u00c2\u00a0 He was mastered by the\nverb \u00e2\u0080\u009cto eat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 He was hunger-mad.\u00c2\u00a0 He took\nno heed of the course he pursued, so long as that course led him\nthrough the swale bottoms.\u00c2\u00a0 He felt his way through the wet\nsnow to the watery muskeg berries, and went by feel as he pulled\nup the rush-grass by the roots.\u00c2\u00a0 But it was tasteless stuff\nand did not satisfy.\u00c2\u00a0 He found a weed that tasted sour and\nhe ate all he could find of it, which was not much, for it was a\ncreeping growth, easily hidden under the several inches of\nsnow.\nHe had no fire that night, nor hot water, and crawled under\nhis blanket to sleep the broken hunger-sleep.\u00c2\u00a0 The snow\nturned into a cold rain.\u00c2\u00a0 He awakened many times to feel it\nfalling on his upturned face.\u00c2\u00a0 Day came\u00e2\u0080\u0094a gray day and\nno sun.\u00c2\u00a0 It had ceased raining.\u00c2\u00a0 The keenness of his\nhunger had departed.\u00c2\u00a0 Sensibility, as far as concerned the\nyearning for food, had been exhausted.\u00c2\u00a0 There was a dull,\nheavy ache in his stomach, but it did not bother him so\nmuch.\u00c2\u00a0 He was more rational, and once more he was chiefly\ninterested in the land of little sticks and the cache by the\nriver Dease.\nHe ripped the remnant of one of his blankets into strips and\nbound his bleeding feet.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, he recinched the injured\nankle and prepared himself for a day of travel.\u00c2\u00a0 When he\ncame to his pack, he paused long over the squat moose-hide sack,\nbut in the end it went with him.\nThe snow had melted under the rain, and only the hilltops\nshowed white.\u00c2\u00a0 The sun came out, and he succeeded in\nlocating the points of the compass, though he knew now that he\nwas lost.\u00c2\u00a0 Perhaps, in his previous days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wanderings,\nhe had edged away too far to the left.\u00c2\u00a0 He now bore off to\nthe right to counteract the possible deviation from his true\ncourse.\nThough the hunger pangs were no longer so exquisite, he\nrealized that he was weak.\u00c2\u00a0 He was compelled to pause for\nfrequent rests, when he attacked the muskeg berries and\nrush-grass patches.\u00c2\u00a0 His tongue felt dry and large, as\nthough covered with a fine hairy growth, and it tasted bitter in\nhis mouth.\u00c2\u00a0 His heart gave him a great deal of\ntrouble.\u00c2\u00a0 When he had travelled a few minutes it would begin\na remorseless thump, thump, thump, and then leap up and away in a\npainful flutter of beats that choked him and made him go faint\nand dizzy.\nIn the middle of the day he found two minnows in a large\npool.\u00c2\u00a0 It was impossible to bale it, but he was calmer now\nand managed to catch them in his tin bucket.\u00c2\u00a0 They were no\nlonger than his little finger, but he was not particularly\nhungry.\u00c2\u00a0 The dull ache in his stomach had been growing\nduller and fainter.\u00c2\u00a0 It seemed almost that his stomach was\ndozing.\u00c2\u00a0 He ate the fish raw, masticating with painstaking\ncare, for the eating was an act of pure reason.\u00c2\u00a0 While he\nhad no desire to eat, he knew that he must eat to live.\nIn the evening he caught three more minnows, eating two and\nsaving the third for breakfast.\u00c2\u00a0 The sun had dried stray\nshreds of moss, and he was able to warm himself with hot\nwater.\u00c2\u00a0 He had not covered more than ten miles that day; and\nthe next day, travelling whenever his heart permitted him, he\ncovered no more than five miles.\u00c2\u00a0 But his stomach did not\ngive him the slightest uneasiness.\u00c2\u00a0 It had gone to\nsleep.\u00c2\u00a0 He was in a strange country, too, and the caribou\nwere growing more plentiful, also the wolves.\u00c2\u00a0 Often their\nyelps drifted across the desolation, and once he saw three of\nthem slinking away before his path.\nAnother night; and in the morning, being more rational, he\nuntied the leather string that fastened the squat moose-hide\nsack.\u00c2\u00a0 From its open mouth poured a yellow stream of coarse\ngold-dust and nuggets.\u00c2\u00a0 He roughly divided the gold in\nhalves, caching one half on a prominent ledge, wrapped in a piece\nof blanket, and returning the other half to the sack.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nalso began to use strips of the one remaining blanket for his\nfeet.\u00c2\u00a0 He still clung to his gun, for there were cartridges\nin that cache by the river Dease.\nThis was a day of fog, and this day hunger awoke in him\nagain.\u00c2\u00a0 He was very weak and was afflicted with a giddiness\nwhich at times blinded him.\u00c2\u00a0 It was no uncommon thing now\nfor him to stumble and fall; and stumbling once, he fell squarely\ninto a ptarmigan nest.\u00c2\u00a0 There were four newly hatched\nchicks, a day old\u00e2\u0080\u0094little specks of pulsating life no more\nthan a mouthful; and he ate them ravenously, thrusting them alive\ninto his mouth and crunching them like egg-shells between his\nteeth.\u00c2\u00a0 The mother ptarmigan beat about him with great\noutcry.\u00c2\u00a0 He used his gun as a club with which to knock her\nover, but she dodged out of reach.\u00c2\u00a0 He threw stones at her\nand with one chance shot broke a wing.\u00c2\u00a0 Then she fluttered\naway, running, trailing the broken wing, with him in pursuit.\nThe little chicks had no more than whetted his appetite.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe hopped and bobbed clumsily along on his injured ankle,\nthrowing stones and screaming hoarsely at times; at other times\nhopping and bobbing silently along, picking himself up grimly and\npatiently when he fell, or rubbing his eyes with his hand when\nthe giddiness threatened to overpower him.\nThe chase led him across swampy ground in the bottom of the\nvalley, and he came upon footprints in the soggy moss.\u00c2\u00a0 They\nwere not his own\u00e2\u0080\u0094he could see that.\u00c2\u00a0 They must be\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00c2\u00a0 But he could not stop, for the mother\nptarmigan was running on.\u00c2\u00a0 He would catch her first, then he\nwould return and investigate.\nHe exhausted the mother ptarmigan; but he exhausted\nhimself.\u00c2\u00a0 She lay panting on her side.\u00c2\u00a0 He lay panting\non his side, a dozen feet away, unable to crawl to her.\u00c2\u00a0 And\nas he recovered she recovered, fluttering out of reach as his\nhungry hand went out to her.\u00c2\u00a0 The chase was resumed.\u00c2\u00a0\nNight settled down and she escaped.\u00c2\u00a0 He stumbled from\nweakness and pitched head foremost on his face, cutting his\ncheek, his pack upon his back.\u00c2\u00a0 He did not move for a long\nwhile; then he rolled over on his side, wound his watch, and lay\nthere until morning.\nAnother day of fog.\u00c2\u00a0 Half of his last blanket had gone\ninto foot-wrappings.\u00c2\u00a0 He failed to pick up Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ntrail.\u00c2\u00a0 It did not matter.\u00c2\u00a0 His hunger was driving him\ntoo compellingly\u00e2\u0080\u0094only\u00e2\u0080\u0094only he wondered if Bill, too,\nwere lost.\u00c2\u00a0 By midday the irk of his pack became too\noppressive.\u00c2\u00a0 Again he divided the gold, this time merely\nspilling half of it on the ground.\u00c2\u00a0 In the afternoon he\nthrew the rest of it away, there remaining to him only the\nhalf-blanket, the tin bucket, and the rifle.\nAn hallucination began to trouble him.\u00c2\u00a0 He felt confident\nthat one cartridge remained to him.\u00c2\u00a0 It was in the chamber\nof the rifle and he had overlooked it.\u00c2\u00a0 On the other hand,\nhe knew all the time that the chamber was empty.\u00c2\u00a0 But the\nhallucination persisted.\u00c2\u00a0 He fought it off for hours, then\nthrew his rifle open and was confronted with emptiness.\u00c2\u00a0 The\ndisappointment was as bitter as though he had really expected to\nfind the cartridge.\nHe plodded on for half an hour, when the hallucination arose\nagain.\u00c2\u00a0 Again he fought it, and still it persisted, till for\nvery relief he opened his rifle to unconvince himself.\u00c2\u00a0 At\ntimes his mind wandered farther afield, and he plodded on, a mere\nautomaton, strange conceits and whimsicalities gnawing at his\nbrain like worms.\u00c2\u00a0 But these excursions out of the real were\nof brief duration, for ever the pangs of the hunger-bite called\nhim back.\u00c2\u00a0 He was jerked back abruptly once from such an\nexcursion by a sight that caused him nearly to faint.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nreeled and swayed, doddering like a drunken man to keep from\nfalling.\u00c2\u00a0 Before him stood a horse.\u00c2\u00a0 A horse!\u00c2\u00a0 He\ncould not believe his eyes.\u00c2\u00a0 A thick mist was in them,\nintershot with sparkling points of light.\u00c2\u00a0 He rubbed his\neyes savagely to clear his vision, and beheld, not a horse, but a\ngreat brown bear.\u00c2\u00a0 The animal was studying him with\nbellicose curiosity.\nThe man had brought his gun halfway to his shoulder before he\nrealized.\u00c2\u00a0 He lowered it and drew his hunting-knife from its\nbeaded sheath at his hip.\u00c2\u00a0 Before him was meat and\nlife.\u00c2\u00a0 He ran his thumb along the edge of his knife.\u00c2\u00a0\nIt was sharp.\u00c2\u00a0 The point was sharp.\u00c2\u00a0 He would fling\nhimself upon the bear and kill it.\u00c2\u00a0 But his heart began its\nwarning thump, thump, thump.\u00c2\u00a0 Then followed the wild upward\nleap and tattoo of flutters, the pressing as of an iron band\nabout his forehead, the creeping of the dizziness into his\nbrain.\nHis desperate courage was evicted by a great surge of\nfear.\u00c2\u00a0 In his weakness, what if the animal attacked\nhim?\u00c2\u00a0 He drew himself up to his most imposing stature,\ngripping the knife and staring hard at the bear.\u00c2\u00a0 The bear\nadvanced clumsily a couple of steps, reared up, and gave vent to\na tentative growl.\u00c2\u00a0 If the man ran, he would run after him;\nbut the man did not run.\u00c2\u00a0 He was animated now with the\ncourage of fear.\u00c2\u00a0 He, too, growled, savagely, terribly,\nvoicing the fear that is to life germane and that lies twisted\nabout life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deepest roots.\nThe bear edged away to one side, growling menacingly, himself\nappalled by this mysterious creature that appeared upright and\nunafraid.\u00c2\u00a0 But the man did not move.\u00c2\u00a0 He stood like a\nstatue till the danger was past, when he yielded to a fit of\ntrembling and sank down into the wet moss.\nHe pulled himself together and went on, afraid now in a new\nway.\u00c2\u00a0 It was not the fear that he should die passively from\nlack of food, but that he should be destroyed violently before\nstarvation had exhausted the last particle of the endeavor in him\nthat made toward surviving.\u00c2\u00a0 There were the wolves.\u00c2\u00a0\nBack and forth across the desolation drifted their howls, weaving\nthe very air into a fabric of menace that was so tangible that he\nfound himself, arms in the air, pressing it back from him as it\nmight be the walls of a wind-blown tent.\nNow and again the wolves, in packs of two and three, crossed\nhis path.\u00c2\u00a0 But they sheered clear of him.\u00c2\u00a0 They were\nnot in sufficient numbers, and besides they were hunting the\ncaribou, which did not battle, while this strange creature that\nwalked erect might scratch and bite.\nIn the late afternoon he came upon scattered bones where the\nwolves had made a kill.\u00c2\u00a0 The debris had been a caribou calf\nan hour before, squawking and running and very much alive.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe contemplated the bones, clean-picked and polished, pink with\nthe cell-life in them which had not yet died.\u00c2\u00a0 Could it\npossibly be that he might be that ere the day was done!\u00c2\u00a0\nSuch was life, eh?\u00c2\u00a0 A vain and fleeting thing.\u00c2\u00a0 It was\nonly life that pained.\u00c2\u00a0 There was no hurt in death.\u00c2\u00a0 To\ndie was to sleep.\u00c2\u00a0 It meant cessation, rest.\u00c2\u00a0 Then why\nwas he not content to die?\nBut he did not moralize long.\u00c2\u00a0 He was squatting in the\nmoss, a bone in his mouth, sucking at the shreds of life that\nstill dyed it faintly pink.\u00c2\u00a0 The sweet meaty taste, thin and\nelusive almost as a memory, maddened him.\u00c2\u00a0 He closed his\njaws on the bones and crunched.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes it was the bone\nthat broke, sometimes his teeth.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he crushed the bones\nbetween rocks, pounded them to a pulp, and swallowed them.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe pounded his fingers, too, in his haste, and yet found a moment\nin which to feel surprise at the fact that his fingers did not\nhurt much when caught under the descending rock.\nCame frightful days of snow and rain.\u00c2\u00a0 He did not know\nwhen he made camp, when he broke camp.\u00c2\u00a0 He travelled in the\nnight as much as in the day.\u00c2\u00a0 He rested wherever he fell,\ncrawled on whenever the dying life in him flickered up and burned\nless dimly.\u00c2\u00a0 He, as a man, no longer strove.\u00c2\u00a0 It was\nthe life in him, unwilling to die, that drove him on.\u00c2\u00a0 He\ndid not suffer.\u00c2\u00a0 His nerves had become blunted, numb, while\nhis mind was filled with weird visions and delicious dreams.\nBut ever he sucked and chewed on the crushed bones of the\ncaribou calf, the least remnants of which he had gathered up and\ncarried with him.\u00c2\u00a0 He crossed no more hills or divides, but\nautomatically followed a large stream which flowed through a wide\nand shallow valley.\u00c2\u00a0 He did not see this stream nor this\nvalley.\u00c2\u00a0 He saw nothing save visions.\u00c2\u00a0 Soul and body\nwalked or crawled side by side, yet apart, so slender was the\nthread that bound them.\nHe awoke in his right mind, lying on his back on a rocky\nledge.\u00c2\u00a0 The sun was shining bright and warm.\u00c2\u00a0 Afar off\nhe heard the squawking of caribou calves.\u00c2\u00a0 He was aware of\nvague memories of rain and wind and snow, but whether he had been\nbeaten by the storm for two days or two weeks he did not\nknow.\nFor some time he lay without movement, the genial sunshine\npouring upon him and saturating his miserable body with its\nwarmth.\u00c2\u00a0 A fine day, he thought.\u00c2\u00a0 Perhaps he could\nmanage to locate himself.\u00c2\u00a0 By a painful effort he rolled\nover on his side.\u00c2\u00a0 Below him flowed a wide and sluggish\nriver.\u00c2\u00a0 Its unfamiliarity puzzled him.\u00c2\u00a0 Slowly he\nfollowed it with his eyes, winding in wide sweeps among the\nbleak, bare hills, bleaker and barer and lower-lying than any\nhills he had yet encountered.\u00c2\u00a0 Slowly, deliberately, without\nexcitement or more than the most casual interest, he followed the\ncourse of the strange stream toward the sky-line and saw it\nemptying into a bright and shining sea.\u00c2\u00a0 He was still\nunexcited.\u00c2\u00a0 Most unusual, he thought, a vision or a\nmirage\u00e2\u0080\u0094more likely a vision, a trick of his disordered\nmind.\u00c2\u00a0 He was confirmed in this by sight of a ship lying at\nanchor in the midst of the shining sea.\u00c2\u00a0 He closed his eyes\nfor a while, then opened them.\u00c2\u00a0 Strange how the vision\npersisted!\u00c2\u00a0 Yet not strange.\u00c2\u00a0 He knew there were no\nseas or ships in the heart of the barren lands, just as he had\nknown there was no cartridge in the empty rifle.\nHe heard a snuffle behind him\u00e2\u0080\u0094a half-choking gasp or\ncough.\u00c2\u00a0 Very slowly, because of his exceeding weakness and\nstiffness, he rolled over on his other side.\u00c2\u00a0 He could see\nnothing near at hand, but he waited patiently.\u00c2\u00a0 Again came\nthe snuffle and cough, and outlined between two jagged rocks not\na score of feet away he made out the gray head of a wolf.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe sharp ears were not pricked so sharply as he had seen them on\nother wolves; the eyes were bleared and bloodshot, the head\nseemed to droop limply and forlornly.\u00c2\u00a0 The animal blinked\ncontinually in the sunshine.\u00c2\u00a0 It seemed sick.\u00c2\u00a0 As he\nlooked it snuffled and coughed again.\nThis, at least, was real, he thought, and turned on the other\nside so that he might see the reality of the world which had been\nveiled from him before by the vision.\u00c2\u00a0 But the sea still\nshone in the distance and the ship was plainly discernible.\u00c2\u00a0\nWas it reality, after all?\u00c2\u00a0 He closed his eyes for a long\nwhile and thought, and then it came to him.\u00c2\u00a0 He had been\nmaking north by east, away from the Dease Divide and into the\nCoppermine Valley.\u00c2\u00a0 This wide and sluggish river was the\nCoppermine.\u00c2\u00a0 That shining sea was the Arctic Ocean.\u00c2\u00a0\nThat ship was a whaler, strayed east, far east, from the mouth of\nthe Mackenzie, and it was lying at anchor in Coronation\nGulf.\u00c2\u00a0 He remembered the Hudson Bay Company chart he had\nseen long ago, and it was all clear and reasonable to him.\nHe sat up and turned his attention to immediate affairs.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe had worn through the blanket-wrappings, and his feet were\nshapeless lumps of raw meat.\u00c2\u00a0 His last blanket was\ngone.\u00c2\u00a0 Rifle and knife were both missing.\u00c2\u00a0 He had lost\nhis hat somewhere, with the bunch of matches in the band, but the\nmatches against his chest were safe and dry inside the tobacco\npouch and oil paper.\u00c2\u00a0 He looked at his watch.\u00c2\u00a0 It\nmarked eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock and was still running.\u00c2\u00a0\nEvidently he had kept it wound.\nHe was calm and collected.\u00c2\u00a0 Though extremely weak, he had\nno sensation of pain.\u00c2\u00a0 He was not hungry.\u00c2\u00a0 The thought\nof food was not even pleasant to him, and whatever he did was\ndone by his reason alone.\u00c2\u00a0 He ripped off his pants\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nlegs to the knees and bound them about his feet.\u00c2\u00a0 Somehow he\nhad succeeded in retaining the tin bucket.\u00c2\u00a0 He would have\nsome hot water before he began what he foresaw was to be a\nterrible journey to the ship.\nHis movements were slow.\u00c2\u00a0 He shook as with a palsy.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhen he started to collect dry moss, he found he could not rise\nto his feet.\u00c2\u00a0 He tried again and again, then contented\nhimself with crawling about on hands and knees.\u00c2\u00a0 Once he\ncrawled near to the sick wolf.\u00c2\u00a0 The animal dragged itself\nreluctantly out of his way, licking its chops with a tongue which\nseemed hardly to have the strength to curl.\u00c2\u00a0 The man noticed\nthat the tongue was not the customary healthy red.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a\nyellowish brown and seemed coated with a rough and half-dry\nmucus.\nAfter he had drunk a quart of hot water the man found he was\nable to stand, and even to walk as well as a dying man might be\nsupposed to walk.\u00c2\u00a0 Every minute or so he was compelled to\nrest.\u00c2\u00a0 His steps were feeble and uncertain, just as the\nwolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that trailed him were feeble and uncertain; and that\nnight, when the shining sea was blotted out by blackness, he knew\nhe was nearer to it by no more than four miles.\nThroughout the night he heard the cough of the sick wolf, and\nnow and then the squawking of the caribou calves.\u00c2\u00a0 There was\nlife all around him, but it was strong life, very much alive and\nwell, and he knew the sick wolf clung to the sick man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ntrail in the hope that the man would die first.\u00c2\u00a0 In the\nmorning, on opening his eyes, he beheld it regarding him with a\nwistful and hungry stare.\u00c2\u00a0 It stood crouched, with tail\nbetween its legs, like a miserable and woe-begone dog.\u00c2\u00a0 It\nshivered in the chill morning wind, and grinned dispiritedly when\nthe man spoke to it in a voice that achieved no more than a\nhoarse whisper.\nThe sun rose brightly, and all morning the man tottered and\nfell toward the ship on the shining sea.\u00c2\u00a0 The weather was\nperfect.\u00c2\u00a0 It was the brief Indian Summer of the high\nlatitudes.\u00c2\u00a0 It might last a week.\u00c2\u00a0 To-morrow or next\nday it might he gone.\nIn the afternoon the man came upon a trail.\u00c2\u00a0 It was of\nanother man, who did not walk, but who dragged himself on all\nfours.\u00c2\u00a0 The man thought it might be Bill, but he thought in\na dull, uninterested way.\u00c2\u00a0 He had no curiosity.\u00c2\u00a0 In\nfact, sensation and emotion had left him.\u00c2\u00a0 He was no longer\nsusceptible to pain.\u00c2\u00a0 Stomach and nerves had gone to\nsleep.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet the life that was in him drove him on.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nwas very weary, but it refused to die.\u00c2\u00a0 It was because it\nrefused to die that he still ate muskeg berries and minnows,\ndrank his hot water, and kept a wary eye on the sick wolf.\nHe followed the trail of the other man who dragged himself\nalong, and soon came to the end of it\u00e2\u0080\u0094a few fresh-picked\nbones where the soggy moss was marked by the foot-pads of many\nwolves.\u00c2\u00a0 He saw a squat moose-hide sack, mate to his own,\nwhich had been torn by sharp teeth.\u00c2\u00a0 He picked it up, though\nits weight was almost too much for his feeble fingers.\u00c2\u00a0 Bill\nhad carried it to the last.\u00c2\u00a0 Ha! ha!\u00c2\u00a0 He would have the\nlaugh on Bill.\u00c2\u00a0 He would survive and carry it to the ship in\nthe shining sea.\u00c2\u00a0 His mirth was hoarse and ghastly, like a\nraven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s croak, and the sick wolf joined him, howling\nlugubriously.\u00c2\u00a0 The man ceased suddenly.\u00c2\u00a0 How could he\nhave the laugh on Bill if that were Bill; if those bones, so\npinky-white and clean, were Bill?\nHe turned away.\u00c2\u00a0 Well, Bill had deserted him; but he\nwould not take the gold, nor would he suck Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbones.\u00c2\u00a0 Bill would have, though, had it been the other way\naround, he mused as he staggered on.\nHe came to a pool of water.\u00c2\u00a0 Stooping over in quest of\nminnows, he jerked his head back as though he had been\nstung.\u00c2\u00a0 He had caught sight of his reflected face.\u00c2\u00a0 So\nhorrible was it that sensibility awoke long enough to be\nshocked.\u00c2\u00a0 There were three minnows in the pool, which was\ntoo large to drain; and after several ineffectual attempts to\ncatch them in the tin bucket he forbore.\u00c2\u00a0 He was afraid,\nbecause of his great weakness, that he might fall in and\ndrown.\u00c2\u00a0 It was for this reason that he did not trust himself\nto the river astride one of the many drift-logs which lined its\nsand-spits.\nThat day he decreased the distance between him and the ship by\nthree miles; the next day by two\u00e2\u0080\u0094for he was crawling now as\nBill had crawled; and the end of the fifth day found the ship\nstill seven miles away and him unable to make even a mile a\nday.\u00c2\u00a0 Still the Indian Summer held on, and he continued to\ncrawl and faint, turn and turn about; and ever the sick wolf\ncoughed and wheezed at his heels.\u00c2\u00a0 His knees had become raw\nmeat like his feet, and though he padded them with the shirt from\nhis back it was a red track he left behind him on the moss and\nstones.\u00c2\u00a0 Once, glancing back, he saw the wolf licking\nhungrily his bleeding trail, and he saw sharply what his own end\nmight be\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless he could get the wolf.\u00c2\u00a0\nThen began as grim a tragedy of existence as was ever\nplayed\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sick man that crawled, a sick wolf that limped,\ntwo creatures dragging their dying carcasses across the\ndesolation and hunting each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives.\nHad it been a well wolf, it would not have mattered so much to\nthe man; but the thought of going to feed the maw of that\nloathsome and all but dead thing was repugnant to him.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nwas finicky.\u00c2\u00a0 His mind had begun to wander again, and to be\nperplexed by hallucinations, while his lucid intervals grew rarer\nand shorter.\nHe was awakened once from a faint by a wheeze close in his\near.\u00c2\u00a0 The wolf leaped lamely back, losing its footing and\nfalling in its weakness.\u00c2\u00a0 It was ludicrous, but he was not\namused.\u00c2\u00a0 Nor was he even afraid.\u00c2\u00a0 He was too far gone\nfor that.\u00c2\u00a0 But his mind was for the moment clear, and he lay\nand considered.\u00c2\u00a0 The ship was no more than four miles\naway.\u00c2\u00a0 He could see it quite distinctly when he rubbed the\nmists out of his eyes, and he could see the white sail of a small\nboat cutting the water of the shining sea.\u00c2\u00a0 But he could\nnever crawl those four miles.\u00c2\u00a0 He knew that, and was very\ncalm in the knowledge.\u00c2\u00a0 He knew that he could not crawl half\na mile.\u00c2\u00a0 And yet he wanted to live.\u00c2\u00a0 It was\nunreasonable that he should die after all he had undergone.\u00c2\u00a0\nFate asked too much of him.\u00c2\u00a0 And, dying, he declined to\ndie.\u00c2\u00a0 It was stark madness, perhaps, but in the very grip of\nDeath he defied Death and refused to die.\nHe closed his eyes and composed himself with infinite\nprecaution.\u00c2\u00a0 He steeled himself to keep above the\nsuffocating languor that lapped like a rising tide through all\nthe wells of his being.\u00c2\u00a0 It was very like a sea, this deadly\nlanguor, that rose and rose and drowned his consciousness bit by\nbit.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes he was all but submerged, swimming through\noblivion with a faltering stroke; and again, by some strange\nalchemy of soul, he would find another shred of will and strike\nout more strongly.\nWithout movement he lay on his back, and he could hear, slowly\ndrawing near and nearer, the wheezing intake and output of the\nsick wolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breath.\u00c2\u00a0 It drew closer, ever closer,\nthrough an infinitude of time, and he did not move.\u00c2\u00a0 It was\nat his ear.\u00c2\u00a0 The harsh dry tongue grated like sandpaper\nagainst his cheek.\u00c2\u00a0 His hands shot out\u00e2\u0080\u0094or at least he\nwilled them to shoot out.\u00c2\u00a0 The fingers were curved like\ntalons, but they closed on empty air.\u00c2\u00a0 Swiftness and\ncertitude require strength, and the man had not this\nstrength.\nThe patience of the wolf was terrible.\u00c2\u00a0 The man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npatience was no less terrible.\u00c2\u00a0 For half a day he lay\nmotionless, fighting off unconsciousness and waiting for the\nthing that was to feed upon him and upon which he wished to\nfeed.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes the languid sea rose over him and he\ndreamed long dreams; but ever through it all, waking and\ndreaming, he waited for the wheezing breath and the harsh caress\nof the tongue.\nHe did not hear the breath, and he slipped slowly from some\ndream to the feel of the tongue along his hand.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nwaited.\u00c2\u00a0 The fangs pressed softly; the pressure increased;\nthe wolf was exerting its last strength in an effort to sink\nteeth in the food for which it had waited so long.\u00c2\u00a0 But the\nman had waited long, and the lacerated hand closed on the\njaw.\u00c2\u00a0 Slowly, while the wolf struggled feebly and the hand\nclutched feebly, the other hand crept across to a grip.\u00c2\u00a0\nFive minutes later the whole weight of the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was\non top of the wolf.\u00c2\u00a0 The hands had not sufficient strength\nto choke the wolf, but the face of the man was pressed close to\nthe throat of the wolf and the mouth of the man was full of\nhair.\u00c2\u00a0 At the end of half an hour the man was aware of a\nwarm trickle in his throat.\u00c2\u00a0 It was not pleasant.\u00c2\u00a0 It\nwas like molten lead being forced into his stomach, and it was\nforced by his will alone.\u00c2\u00a0 Later the man rolled over on his\nback and slept.\n* * * * *\nThere were some members of a scientific expedition on the\nwhale-ship Bedford.\u00c2\u00a0 From the deck they remarked a\nstrange object on the shore.\u00c2\u00a0 It was moving down the beach\ntoward the water.\u00c2\u00a0 They were unable to classify it, and,\nbeing scientific men, they climbed into the whale-boat alongside\nand went ashore to see.\u00c2\u00a0 And they saw something that was\nalive but which could hardly be called a man.\u00c2\u00a0 It was blind,\nunconscious.\u00c2\u00a0 It squirmed along the ground like some\nmonstrous worm.\u00c2\u00a0 Most of its efforts were ineffectual, but\nit was persistent, and it writhed and twisted and went ahead\nperhaps a score of feet an hour.\n* * * * *\nThree weeks afterward the man lay in a bunk on the whale-ship\nBedford, and with tears streaming down his wasted cheeks\ntold who he was and what he had undergone.\u00c2\u00a0 He also babbled\nincoherently of his mother, of sunny Southern California, and a\nhome among the orange groves and flowers.\nThe days were not many after that when he sat at table with\nthe scientific men and ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s officers.\u00c2\u00a0 He gloated\nover the spectacle of so much food, watching it anxiously as it\nwent into the mouths of others.\u00c2\u00a0 With the disappearance of\neach mouthful an expression of deep regret came into his\neyes.\u00c2\u00a0 He was quite sane, yet he hated those men at\nmealtime.\u00c2\u00a0 He was haunted by a fear that the food would not\nlast.\u00c2\u00a0 He inquired of the cook, the cabin-boy, the captain,\nconcerning the food stores.\u00c2\u00a0 They reassured him countless\ntimes; but he could not believe them, and pried cunningly about\nthe lazarette to see with his own eyes.\nIt was noticed that the man was getting fat.\u00c2\u00a0 He grew\nstouter with each day.\u00c2\u00a0 The scientific men shook their heads\nand theorized.\u00c2\u00a0 They limited the man at his meals, but still\nhis girth increased and he swelled prodigiously under his\nshirt.\nThe sailors grinned.\u00c2\u00a0 They knew.\u00c2\u00a0 And when the\nscientific men set a watch on the man, they knew too.\u00c2\u00a0 They\nsaw him slouch for\u00e2\u0080\u0099ard after breakfast, and, like a\nmendicant, with outstretched palm, accost a sailor.\u00c2\u00a0 The\nsailor grinned and passed him a fragment of sea biscuit.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nclutched it avariciously, looked at it as a miser looks at gold,\nand thrust it into his shirt bosom.\u00c2\u00a0 Similar were the\ndonations from other grinning sailors.\nThe scientific men were discreet.\u00c2\u00a0 They let him\nalone.\u00c2\u00a0 But they privily examined his bunk.\u00c2\u00a0 It was\nlined with hardtack; the mattress was stuffed with hardtack;\nevery nook and cranny was filled with hardtack.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet he was\nsane.\u00c2\u00a0 He was taking precautions against another possible\nfamine\u00e2\u0080\u0094that was all.\u00c2\u00a0 He would recover from it, the\nscientific men said; and he did, ere the Bedford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nanchor rumbled down in San Francisco Bay.",
