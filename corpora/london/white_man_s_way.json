  "name": "London - The White Man's Way",
  "body": "âTo cook by your fire and to sleep under your roof for\nthe night,â I had announced on entering old Ebbitsâs\ncabin; and he had looked at me blear-eyed and vacuous, while\nZilla had favored me with a sour face and a contemptuous\ngrunt.Â  Zilla was his wife, and no more bitter-tongued,\nimplacable old squaw dwelt on the Yukon.Â  Nor would I have\nstopped there had my dogs been less tired or had the rest of the\nvillage been inhabited.Â  But this cabin alone had I found\noccupied, and in this cabin, perforce, I took my shelter.\nOld Ebbits now and again pulled his tangled wits together, and\nhints and sparkles of intelligence came and went in his\neyes.Â  Several times during the preparation of my supper he\neven essayed hospitable inquiries about my health, the condition\nand number of my dogs, and the distance I had travelled that\nday.Â  And each time Zilla had looked sourer than ever and\ngrunted more contemptuously.\nYet I confess that there was no particular call for\ncheerfulness on their part.Â  There they crouched by the\nfire, the pair of them, at the end of their days, old and\nwithered and helpless, racked by rheumatism, bitten by hunger,\nand tantalized by the frying-odors of my abundance of meat.Â \nThey rocked back and forth in a slow and hopeless way, and\nregularly, once every five minutes, Ebbits emitted a low\ngroan.Â  It was not so much a groan of pain, as of\npain-weariness.Â  He was oppressed by the weight and the\ntorment of this thing called life, and still more was he\noppressed by the fear of death.Â  His was that eternal\ntragedy of the aged, with whom the joy of life has departed and\nthe instinct for death has not come.\nWhen my moose-meat spluttered rowdily in the frying-pan, I\nnoticed old Ebbitsâs nostrils twitch and distend as he\ncaught the food-scent.Â  He ceased rocking for a space and\nforgot to groan, while a look of intelligence seemed to come into\nhis face.\nZilla, on the other hand, rocked more rapidly, and for the\nfirst time, in sharp little yelps, voiced her pain.Â  It came\nto me that their behavior was like that of hungry dogs, and in\nthe fitness of things I should not have been astonished had Zilla\nsuddenly developed a tail and thumped it on the floor in right\ndoggish fashion.Â  Ebbits drooled a little and stopped his\nrocking very frequently to lean forward and thrust his tremulous\nnose nearer to the source of gustatory excitement.\nWhen I passed them each a plate of the fried meat, they ate\ngreedily, making loud mouth-noisesâchampings of worn teeth\nand sucking intakes of the breath, accompanied by a continuous\nspluttering and mumbling.Â  After that, when I gave them each\na mug of scalding tea, the noises ceased.Â  Easement and\ncontent came into their faces.Â  Zilla relaxed her sour mouth\nlong enough to sigh her satisfaction.Â  Neither rocked any\nmore, and they seemed to have fallen into placid\nmeditation.Â  Then a dampness came into Ebbitsâs eyes,\nand I knew that the sorrow of self-pity was his.Â  The search\nrequired to find their pipes told plainly that they had been\nwithout tobacco a long time, and the old manâs eagerness\nfor the narcotic rendered him helpless, so that I was compelled\nto light his pipe for him.\nâWhy are you all alone in the village?â I\nasked.Â  âIs everybody dead?Â  Has there been a\ngreat sickness?Â  Are you alone left of the\nliving?â\nOld Ebbits shook his head, saying:Â  âNay, there has\nbeen no great sickness.Â  The village has gone away to hunt\nmeat.Â  We be too old, our legs are not strong, nor can our\nbacks carry the burdens of camp and trail.Â  Wherefore we\nremain here and wonder when the young men will return with\nmeat.â\nâWhat if the young men do return with meat?â Zilla\ndemanded harshly.\nâThey may return with much meat,â he quavered\nhopefully.\nâEven so, with much meat,â she continued, more\nharshly than before.Â  âBut of what worth to you and\nme?Â  A few bones to gnaw in our toothless old age.Â  But\nthe back-fat, the kidneys, and the tonguesâthese shall go\ninto other mouths than thine and mine, old man.â\nEbbits nodded his head and wept silently.\nâThere be no one to hunt meat for us,â she cried,\nturning fiercely upon me.\nThere was accusation in her manner, and I shrugged my\nshoulders in token that I was not guilty of the unknown crime\nimputed to me.\nâKnow, O White Man, that it is because of thy kind,\nbecause of all white men, that my man and I have no meat in our\nold age and sit without tobacco in the cold.â\nâNay,â Ebbits said gravely, with a stricter sense\nof justice.Â  âWrong has been done us, it be true; but\nthe white men did not mean the wrong.â\nâWhere be Moklan?â she demanded.Â \nâWhere be thy strong son, Moklan, and the fish he was ever\nwilling to bring that you might eat?â\nThe old man shook his head.\nâAnd where be Bidarshik, thy strong son?Â  Ever was\nhe a mighty hunter, and ever did he bring thee the good back-fat\nand the sweet dried tongues of the moose and the caribou.Â  I\nsee no back-fat and no sweet dried tongues.Â  Your stomach is\nfull with emptiness through the days, and it is for a man of a\nvery miserable and lying people to give you to eat.â\nâNay,â old Ebbits interposed in kindliness,\nâthe white manâs is not a lying people.Â  The\nwhite man speaks true.Â  Always does the white man speak\ntrue.âÂ  He paused, casting about him for words\nwherewith to temper the severity of what he was about to\nsay.Â  âBut the white man speaks true in different\nways.Â  To-day he speaks true one way, to-morrow he speaks\ntrue another way, and there is no understanding him nor his\nway.â\nâTo-day speak true one way, to-morrow speak true another\nway, which is to lie,â was Zillaâs dictum.\nâThere is no understanding the white man,â Ebbits\nwent on doggedly.\nThe meat, and the tea, and the tobacco seemed to have brought\nhim back to life, and he gripped tighter hold of the idea behind\nhis age-bleared eyes.Â  He straightened up somewhat.Â \nHis voice lost its querulous and whimpering note, and became\nstrong and positive.Â  He turned upon me with dignity, and\naddressed me as equal addresses equal.\nâThe white manâs eyes are not shut,â he\nbegan.Â  âThe white man sees all things, and thinks\ngreatly, and is very wise.Â  But the white man of one day is\nnot the white man of next day, and there is no understanding\nhim.Â  He does not do things always in the same way.Â \nAnd what way his next way is to be, one cannot know.Â  Always\ndoes the Indian do the one thing in the one way.Â  Always\ndoes the moose come down from the high mountains when the winter\nis here.Â  Always does the salmon come in the spring when the\nice has gone out of the river.Â  Always does everything do\nall things in the same way, and the Indian knows and\nunderstands.Â  But the white man does not do all things in\nthe same way, and the Indian does not know nor understand.\nâTobacco be very good.Â  It be food to the hungry\nman.Â  It makes the strong man stronger, and the angry man to\nforget that he is angry.Â  Also is tobacco of value.Â  It\nis of very great value.Â  The Indian gives one large salmon\nfor one leaf of tobacco, and he chews the tobacco for a long\ntime.Â  It is the juice of the tobacco that is good.Â \nWhen it runs down his throat it makes him feel good inside.Â \nBut the white man!Â  When his mouth is full with the juice,\nwhat does he do?Â  That juice, that juice of great value, he\nspits it out in the snow and it is lost.Â  Does the white man\nlike tobacco?Â  I do not know.Â  But if he likes tobacco,\nwhy does he spit out its value and lose it in the snow?Â  It\nis a great foolishness and without understanding.â\nHe ceased, puffed at the pipe, found that it was out, and\npassed it over to Zilla, who took the sneer at the white man off\nher lips in order to pucker them about the pipe-stem.Â \nEbbits seemed sinking back into his senility with the tale\nuntold, and I demanded:\nâWhat of thy sons, Moklan and Bidarshik?Â  And why\nis it that you and your old woman are without meat at the end of\nyour years?â\nHe roused himself as from sleep, and straightened up with an\neffort.\nâIt is not good to steal,â he said.Â \nâWhen the dog takes your meat you beat the dog with a\nclub.Â  Such is the law.Â  It is the law the man gave to\nthe dog, and the dog must live to the law, else will it suffer\nthe pain of the club.Â  When man takes your meat, or your\ncanoe, or your wife, you kill that man.Â  That is the law,\nand it is a good law.Â  It is not good to steal, wherefore it\nis the law that the man who steals must die.Â  Whoso breaks\nthe law must suffer hurt.Â  It is a great hurt to\ndie.â\nâBut if you kill the man, why do you not kill the\ndog?â I asked.\nOld Ebbits looked at me in childlike wonder, while Zilla\nsneered openly at the absurdity of my question.\nâIt is the way of the white man,â Ebbits mumbled\nwith an air of resignation.\nâIt is the foolishness of the white man,â snapped\nZilla.\nâThen let old Ebbits teach the white man wisdom,â\nI said softly.\nâThe dog is not killed, because it must pull the sled of\nthe man.Â  No man pulls another manâs sled, wherefore\nthe man is killed.â\nâOh,â I murmured.\nâThat is the law,â old Ebbits went on.Â \nâNow listen, O White Man, and I will tell you of a great\nfoolishness.Â  There is an Indian.Â  His name is\nMobits.Â  From white man he steals two pounds of flour.Â \nWhat does the white man do?Â  Does he beat Mobits?Â \nNo.Â  Does he kill Mobits?Â  No. What does he do to\nMobits?Â  I will tell you, O White Man.Â  He has a\nhouse.Â  He puts Mobits in that house.Â  The roof is\ngood.Â  The walls are thick.Â  He makes a fire that\nMobits may be warm.Â  He gives Mobits plenty grub to\neat.Â  It is good grub.Â  Never in his all days does\nMobits eat so good grub.Â  There is bacon, and bread, and\nbeans without end.Â  Mobits have very good time.\nâThere is a big lock on door so that Mobits does not run\naway.Â  This also is a great foolishness.Â  Mobits will\nnot run away.Â  All the time is there plenty grub in that\nplace, and warm blankets, and a big fire.Â  Very foolish to\nrun away.Â  Mobits is not foolish.Â  Three months Mobits\nstop in that place.Â  He steal two pounds of flour.Â  For\nthat, white man take plenty good care of him.Â  Mobits eat\nmany pounds of flour, many pounds of sugar, of bacon, of beans\nwithout end.Â  Also, Mobits drink much tea.Â  After three\nmonths white man open door and tell Mobits he must go.Â \nMobits does not want to go.Â  He is like dog that is fed long\ntime in one place.Â  He want to stay in that place, and the\nwhite man must drive Mobits away.Â  So Mobits come back to\nthis village, and he is very fat.Â  That is the white\nmanâs way, and there is no understanding it.Â  It is a\nfoolishness, a great foolishness.â\nâBut thy sons?â I insisted.Â  âThy very\nstrong sons and thine old-age hunger?â\nâThere was Moklan,â Ebbits began.\nâA strong man,â interrupted the mother.Â \nâHe could dip paddle all of a day and night and never stop\nfor the need of rest.Â  He was wise in the way of the salmon\nand in the way of the water.Â  He was very wise.â\nâThere was Moklan,â Ebbits repeated, ignoring the\ninterruption.Â  âIn the spring, he went down the Yukon\nwith the young men to trade at Cambell Fort.Â  There is a\npost there, filled with the goods of the white man, and a trader\nwhose name is Jones.Â  Likewise is there a white manâs\nmedicine man, what you call missionary.Â  Also is there bad\nwater at Cambell Fort, where the Yukon goes slim like a maiden,\nand the water is fast, and the currents rush this way and that\nand come together, and there are whirls and sucks, and always are\nthe currents changing and the face of the water changing, so at\nany two times it is never the same.Â  Moklan is my son,\nwherefore he is brave manââ\nâWas not my father brave man?â Zilla demanded.\nâThy father was brave man,â Ebbits acknowledged,\nwith the air of one who will keep peace in the house at any\ncost.Â  âMoklan is thy son and mine, wherefore he is\nbrave.Â  Mayhap, because of thy very brave father, Moklan is\ntoo brave.Â  It is like when too much water is put in the pot\nit spills over.Â  So too much bravery is put into Moklan, and\nthe bravery spills over.\nâThe young men are much afraid of the bad water at\nCambell Fort.Â  But Moklan is not afraid.Â  He laughs\nstrong, Ho! ho! and he goes forth into the bad water.Â  But\nwhere the currents come together the canoe is turned over.Â \nA whirl takes Moklan by the legs, and he goes around and around,\nand down and down, and is seen no more.â\nâAi! ai!â wailed Zilla.Â  âCrafty and\nwise was he, and my first-born!â\nâI am the father of Moklan,â Ebbits said, having\npatiently given the woman space for her noise.Â  âI get\ninto canoe and journey down to Cambell Fort to collect the\ndebt!â\nâDebt!â interrupted.Â  âWhat\ndebt?â\nâThe debt of Jones, who is chief trader,â came the\nanswer.Â  âSuch is the law of travel in a strange\ncountry.â\nI shook my head in token of my ignorance, and Ebbits looked\ncompassion at me, while Zilla snorted her customary contempt.\nâLook you, O White Man,â he said.Â  âIn\nthy camp is a dog that bites.Â  When the dog bites a man, you\ngive that man a present because you are sorry and because it is\nthy dog.Â  You make payment.Â  Is it not so?Â  Also,\nif you have in thy country bad hunting, or bad water, you must\nmake payment.Â  It is just.Â  It is the law.Â  Did\nnot my fatherâs brother go over into the Tanana Country and\nget killed by a bear?Â  And did not the Tanana tribe pay my\nfather many blankets and fine furs?Â  It was just.Â  It\nwas bad hunting, and the Tanana people made payment for the bad\nhunting.\nâSo I, Ebbits, journeyed down to Cambell Fort to collect\nthe debt.Â  Jones, who is chief trader, looked at me, and he\nlaughed.Â  He made great laughter, and would not give\npayment.Â  I went to the medicine-man, what you call\nmissionary, and had large talk about the bad water and the\npayment that should be mine.Â  And the missionary made talk\nabout other things.Â  He talk about where Moklan has gone,\nnow he is dead.Â  There be large fires in that place, and if\nmissionary make true talk, I know that Moklan will be cold no\nmore.Â  Also the missionary talk about where I shall go when\nI am dead.Â  And he say bad things.Â  He say that I am\nblind.Â  Which is a lie.Â  He say that I am in great\ndarkness.Â  Which is a lie.Â  And I say that the day come\nand the night come for everybody just the same, and that in my\nvillage it is no more dark than at Cambell Fort.Â  Also, I\nsay that darkness and light and where we go when we die be\ndifferent things from the matter of payment of just debt for bad\nwater.Â  Then the missionary make large anger, and call me\nbad names of darkness, and tell me to go away.Â  And so I\ncome back from Cambell Fort, and no payment has been made, and\nMoklan is dead, and in my old age I am without fish and\nmeat.â\nâBecause of the white man,â said Zilla.\nâBecause of the white man,â Ebbits\nconcurred.Â  âAnd other things because of the white\nman.Â  There was Bidarshik.Â  One way did the white man\ndeal with him; and yet another way for the same thing did the\nwhite man deal with Yamikan.Â  And first must I tell you of\nYamikan, who was a young man of this village and who chanced to\nkill a white man.Â  It is not good to kill a man of another\npeople.Â  Always is there great trouble.Â  It was not the\nfault of Yamikan that he killed the white man.Â  Yamikan\nspoke always soft words and ran away from wrath as a dog from a\nstick.Â  But this white man drank much whiskey, and in the\nnight-time came to Yamikanâs house and made much\nfight.Â  Yamikan cannot run away, and the white man tries to\nkill him.Â  Yamikan does not like to die, so he kills the\nwhite man.\nâThen is all the village in great trouble.Â  We are\nmuch afraid that we must make large payment to the white\nmanâs people, and we hide our blankets, and our furs, and\nall our wealth, so that it will seem that we are poor people and\ncan make only small payment.Â  After long time white men\ncome.Â  They are soldier white men, and they take Yamikan\naway with them.Â  His mother make great noise and throw ashes\nin her hair, for she knows Yamikan is dead.Â  And all the\nvillage knows that Yamikan is dead, and is glad that no payment\nis asked.\nâThat is in the spring when the ice has gone out of the\nriver.Â  One year go by, two years go by.Â  It is\nspring-time again, and the ice has gone out of the river.Â \nAnd then Yamikan, who is dead, comes back to us, and he is not\ndead, but very fat, and we know that he has slept warm and had\nplenty grub to eat.Â  He has much fine clothes and is all the\nsame white man, and he has gathered large wisdom so that he is\nvery quick head man in the village.\nâAnd he has strange things to tell of the way of the\nwhite man, for he has seen much of the white man and done a great\ntravel into the white manâs country.Â  First place,\nsoldier white men take him down the river long way.Â  All the\nway do they take him down the river to the end, where it runs\ninto a lake which is larger than all the land and large as the\nsky.Â  I do not know the Yukon is so big river, but Yamikan\nhas seen with his own eyes.Â  I do not think there is a lake\nlarger than all the land and large as the sky, but Yamikan has\nseen.Â  Also, he has told me that the waters of this lake be\nsalt, which is a strange thing and beyond understanding.\nâBut the White Man knows all these marvels for himself,\nso I shall not weary him with the telling of them.Â  Only\nwill I tell him what happened to Yamikan.Â  The white man\ngive Yamikan much fine grub.Â  All the time does Yamikan eat,\nand all the time is there plenty more grub.Â  The white man\nlives under the sun, so said Yamikan, where there be much warmth,\nand animals have only hair and no fur, and the green things grow\nlarge and strong and become flour, and beans, and potatoes.Â \nAnd under the sun there is never famine.Â  Always is there\nplenty grub.Â  I do not know.Â  Yamikan has said.\nâAnd here is a strange thing that befell Yamikan.Â \nNever did the white man hurt him.Â  Only did they give him\nwarm bed at night and plenty fine grub.Â  They take him\nacross the salt lake which is big as the sky.Â  He is on\nwhite manâs fire-boat, what you call steamboat, only he is\non boat maybe twenty times bigger than steamboat on Yukon.Â \nAlso, it is made of iron, this boat, and yet does it not\nsink.Â  This I do not understand, but Yamikan has said,\nâI have journeyed far on the iron boat; behold! I am still\nalive.âÂ  It is a white manâs soldier-boat with\nmany soldier men upon it.\nâAfter many sleeps of travel, a long, long time, Yamikan\ncomes to a land where there is no snow.Â  I cannot believe\nthis.Â  It is not in the nature of things that when winter\ncomes there shall be no snow.Â  But Yamikan has seen.Â \nAlso have I asked the white men, and they have said yes, there is\nno snow in that country.Â  But I cannot believe, and now I\nask you if snow never come in that country.Â  Also, I would\nhear the name of that country.Â  I have heard the name\nbefore, but I would hear it again, if it be the sameâthus\nwill I know if I have heard lies or true talk.â\nOld Ebbits regarded me with a wistful face.Â  He would\nhave the truth at any cost, though it was his desire to retain\nhis faith in the marvel he had never seen.\nâYes,â I answered, âit is true talk that you\nhave heard.Â  There is no snow in that country, and its name\nis California.â\nâCal-ee-forn-ee-yeh,â he mumbled twice and thrice,\nlistening intently to the sound of the syllables as they fell\nfrom his lips.Â  He nodded his head in confirmation.Â \nâYes, it is the same country of which Yamikan made\ntalk.â\nI recognized the adventure of Yamikan as one likely to occur\nin the early days when Alaska first passed into the possession of\nthe United States.Â  Such a murder case, occurring before the\ninstalment of territorial law and officials, might well have been\ntaken down to the United States for trial before a Federal\ncourt.\nâWhen Yamikan is in this country where there is no\nsnow,â old Ebbits continued, âhe is taken to large\nhouse where many men make much talk.Â  Long time men\ntalk.Â  Also many questions do they ask Yamikan.Â  By and\nby they tell Yamikan he have no more trouble.Â  Yamikan does\nnot understand, for never has he had any trouble.Â  All the\ntime have they given him warm place to sleep and plenty grub.\nâBut after that they give him much better grub, and they\ngive him money, and they take him many places in white\nmanâs country, and he see many strange things which are\nbeyond the understanding of Ebbits, who is an old man and has not\njourneyed far.Â  After two years, Yamikan comes back to this\nvillage, and he is head man, and very wise until he dies.\nâBut before he dies, many times does he sit by my fire\nand make talk of the strange things he has seen.Â  And\nBidarshik, who is my son, sits by the fire and listens; and his\neyes are very wide and large because of the things he\nhears.Â  One night, after Yamikan has gone home, Bidarshik\nstands up, so, very tall, and he strikes his chest with his fist,\nand says, âWhen I am a man, I shall journey in far places,\neven to the land where there is no snow, and see things for\nmyself.ââ\nâAlways did Bidarshik journey in far places,â\nZilla interrupted proudly.\nâIt be true,â Ebbits assented gravely.Â \nâAnd always did he return to sit by the fire and hunger for\nyet other and unknown far places.â\nâAnd always did he remember the salt lake as big as the\nsky and the country under the sun where there is no snow,â\nquoth Zilla.\nâAnd always did he say, âWhen I have the full\nstrength of a man, I will go and see for myself if the talk of\nYamikan be true talk,ââ said Ebbits.\nâBut there was no way to go to the white manâs\ncountry,â said Zilla.\nâDid he not go down to the salt lake that is big as the\nsky?â Ebbits demanded.\nâAnd there was no way for him across the salt\nlake,â said Zilla.\nâSave in the white manâs fire-boat which is of\niron and is bigger than twenty steamboats on the Yukon,â\nsaid Ebbits.Â  He scowled at Zilla, whose withered lips were\nagain writhing into speech, and compelled her to silence.Â \nâBut the white man would not let him cross the salt lake in\nthe fire-boat, and he returned to sit by the fire and hunger for\nthe country under the sun where there is no\nsnow.ââ\nâYet on the salt lake had he seen the fire-boat of iron\nthat did not sink,â cried out Zilla the irrepressible.\nâAy,â said Ebbits, âand he saw that Yamikan\nhad made true talk of the things he had seen.Â  But there was\nno way for Bidarshik to journey to the white manâs land\nunder the sun, and he grew sick and weary like an old man and\nmoved not away from the fire.Â  No longer did he go forth to\nkill meatââ\nâAnd no longer did he eat the meat placed before\nhim,â Zilla broke in.Â  âHe would shake his head\nand say, âOnly do I care to eat the grub of the white man\nand grow fat after the manner of Yamikan.ââ\nâAnd he did not eat the meat,â Ebbits went\non.Â  âAnd the sickness of Bidarshik grew into a great\nsickness until I thought he would die.Â  It was not a\nsickness of the body, but of the head.Â  It was a sickness of\ndesire.Â  I, Ebbits, who am his father, make a great\nthink.Â  I have no more sons and I do not want Bidarshik to\ndie.Â  It is a head-sickness, and there is but one way to\nmake it well.Â  Bidarshik must journey across the lake as\nlarge as the sky to the land where there is no snow, else will he\ndie.Â  I make a very great think, and then I see the way for\nBidarshik to go.\nâSo, one night when he sits by the fire, very sick, his\nhead hanging down, I say, âMy son, I have learned the way\nfor you to go to the white manâs land.âÂ  He\nlooks at me, and his face is glad.Â  âGo,â I say,\nâeven as Yamikan went.âÂ  But Bidarshik is sick\nand does not understand.Â  âGo forth,â I say,\nâand find a white man, and, even as Yamikan, do you kill\nthat white man.Â  Then will the soldier white men come and\nget you, and even as they took Yamikan will they take you across\nthe salt lake to the white manâs land.Â  And then, even\nas Yamikan, will you return very fat, your eyes full of the\nthings you have seen, your head filled with wisdom.â\nâAnd Bidarshik stands up very quick, and his hand is\nreaching out for his gun.Â  âWhere do you go?â I\nask.Â  âTo kill the white man,â he says.Â \nAnd I see that my words have been good in the ears of Bidarshik\nand that he will grow well again.Â  Also do I know that my\nwords have been wise.\nâThere is a white man come to this village.Â  He\ndoes not seek after gold in the ground, nor after furs in the\nforest.Â  All the time does he seek after bugs and\nflies.Â  He does not eat the bugs and flies, then why does he\nseek after them?Â  I do not know.Â  Only do I know that\nhe is a funny white man.Â  Also does he seek after the eggs\nof birds.Â  He does not eat the eggs.Â  All that is\ninside he takes out, and only does he keep the shell.Â \nEggshell is not good to eat.Â  Nor does he eat the eggshells,\nbut puts them away in soft boxes where they will not break.Â \nHe catch many small birds.Â  But he does not eat the\nbirds.Â  He takes only the skins and puts them away in\nboxes.Â  Also does he like bones.Â  Bones are not good to\neat.Â  And this strange white man likes best the bones of\nlong time ago which he digs out of the ground.\nâBut he is not a fierce white man, and I know he will\ndie very easy; so I say to Bidarshik, âMy son, there is the\nwhite man for you to kill.âÂ  And Bidarshik says that\nmy words be wise.Â  So he goes to a place he knows where are\nmany bones in the ground.Â  He digs up very many of these\nbones and brings them to the strange white manâs\ncamp.Â  The white man is made very glad.Â  His face\nshines like the sun, and he smiles with much gladness as he looks\nat the bones.Â  He bends his head over, so, to look well at\nthe bones, and then Bidarshik strikes him hard on the head, with\naxe, once, so, and the strange white man kicks and is dead.\nââNow,â I say to Bidarshik, âwill the\nwhite soldier men come and take you away to the land under the\nsun, where you will eat much and grow fat.âÂ  Bidarshik\nis happy.Â  Already has his sickness gone from him, and he\nsits by the fire and waits for the coming of the white soldier\nmen.\nâHow was I to know the way of the white man is never\ntwice the same?â the old man demanded, whirling upon me\nfiercely.Â  âHow was I to know that what the white man\ndoes yesterday he will not do to-day, and that what he does\nto-day he will not do to-morrow?âÂ  Ebbits shook his\nhead sadly.Â  âThere is no understanding the white\nman.Â  Yesterday he takes Yamikan to the land under the sun\nand makes him fat with much grub.Â  To-day he takes Bidarshik\nandâwhat does he do with Bidarshik?Â  Let me tell you\nwhat he does with Bidarshik.\nâI, Ebbits, his father, will tell you.Â  He takes\nBidarshik to Cambell Fort, and he ties a rope around his neck,\nso, and, when his feet are no more on the ground, he\ndies.â\nâAi! ai!â wailed Zilla.Â  âAnd never\ndoes he cross the lake large as the sky, nor see the land under\nthe sun where there is no snow.â\nâWherefore,â old Ebbits said with grave dignity,\nâthere be no one to hunt meat for me in my old age, and I\nsit hungry by my fire and tell my story to the White Man who has\ngiven me grub, and strong tea, and tobacco for my\npipe.â\nâBecause of the lying and very miserable white\npeople,â Zilla proclaimed shrilly.\nâNay,â answered the old man with gentle\npositiveness.Â  âBecause of the way of the white man,\nwhich is without understanding and never twice the\nsame.â",
