    "name": "London - Brown Wolf",
    "body": "She had delayed, because of the dew-wet grass, in order to put\non her overshoes, and when she emerged from the house found her\nwaiting husband absorbed in the wonder of a bursting\nalmond-bud.\u00c2\u00a0 She sent a questing glance across the tall\ngrass and in and out among the orchard trees.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wolf?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was here a moment ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Walt Irvine drew\nhimself away with a jerk from the metaphysics and poetry of the\norganic miracle of blossom, and surveyed the landscape.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was running a rabbit the last I saw of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWolf!\u00c2\u00a0 Wolf!\u00c2\u00a0 Here Wolf!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she called,\nas they left the clearing and took the trail that led down\nthrough the waxen-belled manzanita jungle to the county road.\nIrvine thrust between his lips the little finger of each hand\nand lent to her efforts a shrill whistling.\nShe covered her ears hastily and made a wry grimace.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy! for a poet, delicately attuned and all the rest of\nit, you can make unlovely noises.\u00c2\u00a0 My ear-drums are\npierced.\u00c2\u00a0 You outwhistle\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOrpheus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was about to say a street-arab,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she concluded\nseverely.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoesy does not prevent one from being\npractical\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent\nme.\u00c2\u00a0 Mine is no futility of genius that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsell gems to the magazines.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe assumed a mock extravagance, and went on:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am no attic singer, no ballroom warbler.\u00c2\u00a0 And\nwhy?\u00c2\u00a0 Because I am practical.\u00c2\u00a0 Mine is no squalor of\nsong that cannot transmute itself, with proper exchange value,\ninto a flower-crowned cottage, a sweet mountain-meadow, a grove\nof redwoods, an orchard of thirty-seven trees, one long row of\nblackberries and two short rows of strawberries, to say nothing\nof a quarter of a mile of gurgling brook.\u00c2\u00a0 I am a\nbeauty-merchant, a trader in song, and I pursue utility, dear\nMadge.\u00c2\u00a0 I sing a song, and thanks to the magazine editors I\ntransmute my song into a waft of the west wind sighing through\nour redwoods, into a murmur of waters over mossy stones that\nsings back to me another song than the one I sang and yet the\nsame song wonderfully\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094transmuted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO that all your song-transmutations were as\nsuccessful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cName one that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose two beautiful sonnets that you transmuted into\nthe cow that was accounted the worst milker in the\ntownship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was beautiful\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give milk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge\ninterrupted.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut she was beautiful, now, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nshe?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he insisted.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where beauty and utility fall\nout,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was her reply.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\nWolf!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFrom the thicket-covered hillside came a crashing of\nunderbrush, and then, forty feet above them, on the edge of the\nsheer wall of rock, appeared a wolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head and\nshoulders.\u00c2\u00a0 His braced fore paws dislodged a pebble, and\nwith sharp-pricked ears and peering eyes he watched the fall of\nthe pebble till it struck at their feet.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he\ntransferred his gaze and with open mouth laughed down at\nthem.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou Wolf, you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou blessed\nWolf!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man and woman called out to him.\nThe ears flattened back and down at the sound, and the head\nseemed to snuggle under the caress of an invisible hand.\nThey watched him scramble backward into the thicket, then\nproceeded on their way.\u00c2\u00a0 Several minutes later, rounding a\nturn in the trail where the descent was less precipitous, he\njoined them in the midst of a miniature avalanche of pebbles and\nloose soil.\u00c2\u00a0 He was not demonstrative.\u00c2\u00a0 A pat and a rub\naround the ears from the man, and a more prolonged caressing from\nthe woman, and he was away down the trail in front of them,\ngliding effortlessly over the ground in true wolf fashion.\nIn build and coat and brush he was a huge timber-wolf; but the\nlie was given to his wolfhood by his color and marking.\u00c2\u00a0\nThere the dog unmistakably advertised itself.\u00c2\u00a0 No wolf was\never colored like him.\u00c2\u00a0 He was brown, deep brown, red-brown,\nan orgy of browns.\u00c2\u00a0 Back and shoulders were a warm brown\nthat paled on the sides and underneath to a yellow that was dingy\nbecause of the brown that lingered in it.\u00c2\u00a0 The white of the\nthroat and paws and the spots over the eyes was dirty because of\nthe persistent and ineradicable brown, while the eyes themselves\nwere twin topazes, golden and brown.\nThe man and woman loved the dog very much; perhaps this was\nbecause it had been such a task to win his love.\u00c2\u00a0 It had\nbeen no easy matter when he first drifted in mysteriously out of\nnowhere to their little mountain cottage.\u00c2\u00a0 Footsore and\nfamished, he had killed a rabbit under their very noses and under\ntheir very windows, and then crawled away and slept by the spring\nat the foot of the blackberry bushes.\u00c2\u00a0 When Walt Irvine went\ndown to inspect the intruder, he was snarled at for his pains,\nand Madge likewise was snarled at when she went down to present,\nas a peace-offering, a large pan of bread and milk.\nA most unsociable dog he proved to be, resenting all their\nadvances, refusing to let them lay hands on him, menacing them\nwith bared fangs and bristling hair.\u00c2\u00a0 Nevertheless he\nremained, sleeping and resting by the spring, and eating the food\nthey gave him after they set it down at a safe distance and\nretreated.\u00c2\u00a0 His wretched physical condition explained why he\nlingered; and when he had recuperated, after several days\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsojourn, he disappeared.\nAnd this would have been the end of him, so far as Irvine and\nhis wife were concerned, had not Irvine at that particular time\nbeen called away into the northern part of the state.\u00c2\u00a0\nRiding along on the train, near to the line between California\nand Oregon, he chanced to look out of the window and saw his\nunsociable guest sliding along the wagon road, brown and wolfish,\ntired yet tireless, dust-covered and soiled with two hundred\nmiles of travel.\nNow Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet.\u00c2\u00a0 He got off the\ntrain at the next station, bought a piece of meat at a butcher\nshop, and captured the vagrant on the outskirts of the\ntown.\u00c2\u00a0 The return trip was made in the baggage car, and so\nWolf came a second time to the mountain cottage.\u00c2\u00a0 Here he\nwas tied up for a week and made love to by the man and\nwoman.\u00c2\u00a0 But it was very circumspect love-making.\u00c2\u00a0\nRemote and alien as a traveller from another planet, he snarled\ndown their soft-spoken love-words.\u00c2\u00a0 He never barked.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn all the time they had him he was never known to bark.\nTo win him became a problem.\u00c2\u00a0 Irvine liked\nproblems.\u00c2\u00a0 He had a metal plate made, on which was\nstamped:\u00c2\u00a0 Return to Walt Irvine,\nGlen Ellen, Sonoma\nCounty, California.\u00c2\u00a0 This\nwas riveted to a collar and strapped about the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nneck.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he was turned loose, and promptly he\ndisappeared.\u00c2\u00a0 A day later came a telegram from Mendocino\nCounty.\u00c2\u00a0 In twenty hours he had made over a hundred miles to\nthe north, and was still going when captured.\nHe came back by Wells Fargo Express, was tied up three days,\nand was loosed on the fourth and lost.\u00c2\u00a0 This time he gained\nsouthern Oregon before he was caught and returned.\u00c2\u00a0 Always,\nas soon as he received his liberty, he fled away, and always he\nfled north.\u00c2\u00a0 He was possessed of an obsession that drove him\nnorth.\u00c2\u00a0 The homing instinct, Irvine called it, after he had\nexpended the selling price of a sonnet in getting the animal back\nfrom northern Oregon.\nAnother time the brown wanderer succeeded in traversing half\nthe length of California, all of Oregon, and most of Washington,\nbefore he was picked up and returned \u00e2\u0080\u009cCollect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\nA remarkable thing was the speed with which he travelled.\u00c2\u00a0\nFed up and rested, as soon as he was loosed he devoted all his\nenergy to getting over the ground.\u00c2\u00a0 On the first day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrun he was known to cover as high as a hundred and fifty miles,\nand after that he would average a hundred miles a day until\ncaught.\u00c2\u00a0 He always arrived back lean and hungry and savage,\nand always departed fresh and vigorous, cleaving his way\nnorthward in response to some prompting of his being that no one\ncould understand.\nBut at last, after a futile year of flight, he accepted the\ninevitable and elected to remain at the cottage where first he\nhad killed the rabbit and slept by the spring.\u00c2\u00a0 Even after\nthat, a long time elapsed before the man and woman succeeded in\npatting him.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a great victory, for they alone were\nallowed to put hands on him.\u00c2\u00a0 He was fastidiously exclusive,\nand no guest at the cottage ever succeeded in making up to\nhim.\u00c2\u00a0 A low growl greeted such approach; if any one had the\nhardihood to come nearer, the lips lifted, the naked fangs\nappeared, and the growl became a snarl\u00e2\u0080\u0094a snarl so terrible\nand malignant that it awed the stoutest of them, as it likewise\nawed the farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dogs that knew ordinary dog-snarling, but\nhad never seen wolf-snarling before.\nHe was without antecedents.\u00c2\u00a0 His history began with Walt\nand Madge.\u00c2\u00a0 He had come up from the south, but never a clew\ndid they get of the owner from whom he had evidently fled.\u00c2\u00a0\nMrs. Johnson, their nearest neighbor and the one who supplied\nthem with milk, proclaimed him a Klondike dog.\u00c2\u00a0 Her brother\nwas burrowing for frozen pay-streaks in that far country, and so\nshe constituted herself an authority on the subject.\nBut they did not dispute her.\u00c2\u00a0 There were the tips of\nWolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears, obviously so severely frozen at some time that\nthey would never quite heal again.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, he looked like\nthe photographs of the Alaskan dogs they saw published in\nmagazines and newspapers.\u00c2\u00a0 They often speculated over his\npast, and tried to conjure up (from what they had read and heard)\nwhat his northland life had been.\u00c2\u00a0 That the northland still\ndrew him, they knew; for at night they sometimes heard him crying\nsoftly; and when the north wind blew and the bite of frost was in\nthe air, a great restlessness would come upon him and he would\nlift a mournful lament which they knew to be the long\nwolf-howl.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet he never barked.\u00c2\u00a0 No provocation was\ngreat enough to draw from him that canine cry.\nLong discussion they had, during the time of winning him, as\nto whose dog he was.\u00c2\u00a0 Each claimed him, and each proclaimed\nloudly any expression of affection made by him.\u00c2\u00a0 But the man\nhad the better of it at first, chiefly because he was a\nman.\u00c2\u00a0 It was patent that Wolf had had no experience with\nwomen.\u00c2\u00a0 He did not understand women.\u00c2\u00a0 Madge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nskirts were something he never quite accepted.\u00c2\u00a0 The swish of\nthem was enough to set him a-bristle with suspicion, and on a\nwindy day she could not approach him at all.\nOn the other hand, it was Madge who fed him; also it was she\nwho ruled the kitchen, and it was by her favor, and her favor\nalone, that he was permitted to come within that sacred\nprecinct.\u00c2\u00a0 It was because of these things that she bade fair\nto overcome the handicap of her garments.\u00c2\u00a0 Then it was that\nWalt put forth special effort, making it a practice to have Wolf\nlie at his feet while he wrote, and, between petting and talking,\nlosing much time from his work.\u00c2\u00a0 Walt won in the end, and\nhis victory was most probably due to the fact that he was a man,\nthough Madge averred that they would have had another quarter of\na mile of gurgling brook, and at least two west winds sighing\nthrough their redwoods, had Walt properly devoted his energies to\nsong-transmutation and left Wolf alone to exercise a natural\ntaste and an unbiassed judgment.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about time I heard from those\ntriolets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walt said, after a silence of five minutes,\nduring which they had swung steadily down the trail.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a check at the post-office, I know, and\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll transmute it into beautiful buckwheat flour, a gallon\nof maple syrup, and a new pair of overshoes for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd into beautiful milk from Mrs. Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbeautiful cow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge added.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo-morrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthe first of the month, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWalt scowled unconsciously; then his face brightened, and he\nclapped his hand to his breast pocket.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind.\u00c2\u00a0 I have here a nice beautiful new cow,\nthe best milker in California.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen did you write it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she demanded\neagerly.\u00c2\u00a0 Then, reproachfully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you never showed\nit to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI saved it to read to you on the way to the\npost-office, in a spot remarkably like this one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nanswered, indicating, with a wave of his hand, a dry log on which\nto sit.\nA tiny stream flowed out of a dense fern-brake, slipped down a\nmossy-lipped stone, and ran across the path at their feet.\u00c2\u00a0\nFrom the valley arose the mellow song of meadow-larks, while\nabout them, in and out, through sunshine and shadow, fluttered\ngreat yellow butterflies.\nUp from below came another sound that broke in upon Walt\nreading softly from his manuscript.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a crunching of\nheavy feet, punctuated now and again by the clattering of a\ndisplaced stone.\u00c2\u00a0 As Walt finished and looked to his wife\nfor approval, a man came into view around the turn of the\ntrail.\u00c2\u00a0 He was bare-headed and sweaty.\u00c2\u00a0 With a\nhandkerchief in one hand he mopped his face, while in the other\nhand he carried a new hat and a wilted starched collar which he\nhad removed from his neck.\u00c2\u00a0 He was a well-built man, and his\nmuscles seemed on the point of bursting out of the painfully new\nand ready-made black clothes he wore.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWarm day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walt greeted him.\u00c2\u00a0 Walt believed\nin country democracy, and never missed an opportunity to practise\nit.\nThe man paused and nodded.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used much to the warm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nvouchsafed half apologetically.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m more\naccustomed to zero weather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find any of that in this\ncountry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walt laughed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShould say not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man answered.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t here a-lookin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for it\nneither.\u00c2\u00a0 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tryin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to find my sister.\u00c2\u00a0\nMebbe you know where she lives.\u00c2\u00a0 Her name\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Johnson,\nMrs. William Johnson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not her Klondike brother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge\ncried, her eyes bright with interest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout whom\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard so much?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes\u00e2\u0080\u0099m, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered\nmodestly.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Miller, Skiff\nMiller.\u00c2\u00a0 I just thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d s\u00e2\u0080\u0099prise\nher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are on the right track then.\u00c2\u00a0 Only\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come by the foot-path.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Madge stood up\nto direct him, pointing up the canyon a quarter of a mile.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see that blasted redwood?\u00c2\u00a0 Take the little trail\nturning off to the right.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the short cut to her\nhouse.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes\u00e2\u0080\u0099m, thank you, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid.\u00c2\u00a0 He made tentative efforts to go, but seemed awkwardly\nrooted to the spot.\u00c2\u00a0 He was gazing at her with an open\nadmiration of which he was quite unconscious, and which was\ndrowning, along with him, in the rising sea of embarrassment in\nwhich he floundered.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to hear you tell about the\nKlondike,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge said.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cMayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we come\nover some day while you are at your sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\u00c2\u00a0 Or,\nbetter yet, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come over and have dinner with\nus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes\u00e2\u0080\u0099m, thank you, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he mumbled\nmechanically.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he caught himself up and added:\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stoppin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 long.\u00c2\u00a0 I got to be\npullin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 north again.\u00c2\u00a0 I go out on to-night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ntrain.\u00c2\u00a0 You see, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a mail contract with the\ngovernment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhen Madge had said that it was too bad, he made another\nfutile effort to go.\u00c2\u00a0 But he could not take his eyes from\nher face.\u00c2\u00a0 He forgot his embarrassment in his admiration,\nand it was her turn to flush and feel uncomfortable.\nIt was at this juncture, when Walt had just decided it was\ntime for him to be saying something to relieve the strain, that\nWolf, who had been away nosing through the brush, trotted\nwolf-like into view.\nSkiff Miller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abstraction disappeared.\u00c2\u00a0 The pretty\nwoman before him passed out of his field of vision.\u00c2\u00a0 He had\neyes only for the dog, and a great wonder came into his face.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be damned!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he enunciated slowly\nand solemnly.\nHe sat down ponderingly on the log, leaving Madge\nstanding.\u00c2\u00a0 At the sound of his voice, Wolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears had\nflattened down, then his mouth had opened in a laugh.\u00c2\u00a0 He\ntrotted slowly up to the stranger and first smelled his hands,\nthen licked them with his tongue.\nSkiff Miller patted the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, and slowly and\nsolemnly repeated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be damned!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExcuse me, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said the next moment\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was just s\u00e2\u0080\u0099prised some, that was all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re surprised, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered\nlightly.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe never saw Wolf make up to a stranger\nbefore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that what you call him\u00e2\u0080\u0094Wolf?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man\nasked.\nMadge nodded.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand his\nfriendliness toward you\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re from the Klondike.\u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Klondike dog,\nyou know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes\u00e2\u0080\u0099m,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller said absently.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nlifted one of Wolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fore legs and examined the foot-pads,\npressing them and denting them with his thumb.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cKind\nof soft,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he remarked.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been on\ntrail for a long time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walt broke in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is remarkable\nthe way he lets you handle him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSkiff Miller arose, no longer awkward with admiration of\nMadge, and in a sharp, businesslike manner asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long\nhave you had him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut just then the dog, squirming and rubbing against the\nnewcomer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs, opened his mouth and barked.\u00c2\u00a0 It was\nan explosive bark, brief and joyous, but a bark.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new one on me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Skiff Miller\nremarked.\nWalt and Madge stared at each other.\u00c2\u00a0 The miracle had\nhappened.\u00c2\u00a0 Wolf had barked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first time he ever barked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge\nsaid.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst time I ever heard him, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller\nvolunteered.\nMadge smiled at him.\u00c2\u00a0 The man was evidently a\nhumorist.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince you have only\nseen him for five minutes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSkiff Miller looked at her sharply, seeking in her face the\nguile her words had led him to suspect.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you understood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said slowly.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d tumbled to it from his makin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nup to me.\u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my dog.\u00c2\u00a0 His name ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nWolf.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Brown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Walt!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Madge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instinctive cry to\nher husband.\nWalt was on the defensive at once.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you know he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your dog?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ndemanded.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause he is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the reply.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMere assertion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walt said sharply.\nIn his slow and pondering way, Skiff Miller looked at him,\nthen asked, with a nod of his head toward Madge:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow d\u00e2\u0080\u0099you know she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your wife?\u00c2\u00a0 You\njust say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Because she is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mere assertion.\u00c2\u00a0 The dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mine.\u00c2\u00a0 I\nbred \u00e2\u0080\u0099m an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 raised \u00e2\u0080\u0099m, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I guess I\nought to know.\u00c2\u00a0 Look here.\u00c2\u00a0 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll prove it to\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSkiff Miller turned to the dog.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBrown!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 His voice rang out sharply, and at the\nsound the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears flattened down as to a caress.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 The dog made a swinging turn to the\nright.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow mush-on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 And the dog ceased\nhis swing abruptly and started straight ahead, halting obediently\nat command.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can do it with whistles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Skiff Miller said\nproudly.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was my lead dog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you are not going to take him away with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMadge asked tremulously.\nThe man nodded.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBack into that awful Klondike world of\nsuffering?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe nodded and added:\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so bad as\nall that.\u00c2\u00a0 Look at me.\u00c2\u00a0 Pretty healthy specimen,\nain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the dogs!\u00c2\u00a0 The terrible hardship, the\nheart-breaking toil, the starvation, the frost!\u00c2\u00a0 Oh,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read about it and I know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI nearly ate him once, over on Little Fish\nRiver,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller volunteered grimly.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I\nhadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got a moose that day was all that saved\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099m.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have died first!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge cried.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThings is different down here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller\nexplained.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to eat dogs.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou think different just about the time you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all\nin.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never ben all in, so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nanything about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the very point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she argued\nwarmly.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cDogs are not eaten in California.\u00c2\u00a0 Why\nnot leave him here?\u00c2\u00a0 He is happy.\u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never\nwant for food\u00e2\u0080\u0094you know that.\u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never suffer\nfrom cold and hardship.\u00c2\u00a0 Here all is softness and\ngentleness.\u00c2\u00a0 Neither the human nor nature is savage.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe will never know a whip-lash again.\u00c2\u00a0 And as for the\nweather\u00e2\u0080\u0094why, it never snows here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all-fired hot in summer, beggin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nyour pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Skiff Miller laughed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you do not answer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge continued\npassionately.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have you to offer him in that\nnorthland life?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrub, when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got it, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most of\nthe time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d came the answer.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the rest of the time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo grub.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, plenty of work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller blurted out\nimpatiently.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWork without end, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 famine,\nan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 frost, an all the rest of the\nmiseries\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get when he comes\nwith me.\u00c2\u00a0 But he likes it.\u00c2\u00a0 He is used to it.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nknows that life.\u00c2\u00a0 He was born to it an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 brought up to\nit.\u00c2\u00a0 An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything about it.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about.\u00c2\u00a0\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the dog belongs, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be happiest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe dog doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walt announced in a\ndetermined voice.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo there is no need of further\ndiscussion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Skiff Miller demanded, his\nbrows lowering and an obstinate flush of blood reddening his\nforehead.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI said the dog doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go, and that settles\nit.\u00c2\u00a0 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your dog.\u00c2\u00a0 You\nmay have seen him sometime.\u00c2\u00a0 You may even sometime have\ndriven him for his owner.\u00c2\u00a0 But his obeying the ordinary\ndriving commands of the Alaskan trail is no demonstration that he\nis yours.\u00c2\u00a0 Any dog in Alaska would obey you as he\nobeyed.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, he is undoubtedly a valuable dog, as dogs\ngo in Alaska, and that is sufficient explanation of your desire\nto get possession of him.\u00c2\u00a0 Anyway, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to prove\nproperty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSkiff Miller, cool and collected, the obstinate flush a trifle\ndeeper on his forehead, his huge muscles bulging under the black\ncloth of his coat, carefully looked the poet up and down as\nthough measuring the strength of his slenderness.\nThe Klondiker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face took on a contemptuous expression\nas he said finally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI reckon there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nin sight to prevent me takin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the dog right here an\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nnow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWalt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face reddened, and the striking-muscles of his\narms and shoulders seemed to stiffen and grow tense.\u00c2\u00a0 His\nwife fluttered apprehensively into the breach.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe Mr. Miller is right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid that he is.\u00c2\u00a0 Wolf does seem to know him,\nand certainly he answers to the name of\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Brown.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 He made friends with him instantly,\nand you know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something he never did with anybody\nbefore.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, look at the way he barked.\u00c2\u00a0 He was\njust bursting with joy.\u00c2\u00a0 Joy over what?\u00c2\u00a0 Without doubt\nat finding Mr. Miller.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWalt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s striking-muscles relaxed, and his shoulders\nseemed to droop with hopelessness.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, Madge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWolf isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Wolf, but Brown, and he must\nbelong to Mr. Miller.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps Mr. Miller will sell him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsuggested.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can buy him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSkiff Miller shook his head, no longer belligerent, but\nkindly, quick to be generous in response to generousness.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had five dogs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, casting about for the\neasiest way to temper his refusal.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was the\nleader.\u00c2\u00a0 They was the crack team of Alaska.\u00c2\u00a0\nNothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 could touch \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.\u00c2\u00a0 In 1898 I refused five\nthousand dollars for the bunch.\u00c2\u00a0 Dogs was high, then,\nanyway; but that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what made the fancy price.\u00c2\u00a0 It\nwas the team itself.\u00c2\u00a0 Brown was the best in the team.\u00c2\u00a0\nThat winter I refused twelve hundred for \u00e2\u0080\u0099m.\u00c2\u00a0 I\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sell \u00e2\u0080\u0099m then, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\na-sellin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0099m now.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, I think a mighty lot\nof that dog.\u00c2\u00a0 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ben lookin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for \u00e2\u0080\u0099m for\nthree years.\u00c2\u00a0 It made me fair sick when I found he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nben stole\u00e2\u0080\u0094not the value of him, but the\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, I liked\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099m like hell, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all, beggin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 your\npardon.\u00c2\u00a0 I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe my eyes when I seen\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just now.\u00c2\u00a0 I thought I was dreamin\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00c2\u00a0 It\nwas too good to be true.\u00c2\u00a0 Why, I was his wet-nurse.\u00c2\u00a0 I\nput \u00e2\u0080\u0099m to bed, snug every night.\u00c2\u00a0 His mother died, and\nI brought \u00e2\u0080\u0099m up on condensed milk at two dollars a can when\nI couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford it in my own coffee.\u00c2\u00a0 He never knew\nany mother but me.\u00c2\u00a0 He used to suck my finger regular, the\ndarn little cuss\u00e2\u0080\u0094that finger right there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnd Skiff Miller, too overwrought for speech, held up a fore\nfinger for them to see.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat very finger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he managed to articulate, as\nthough it somehow clinched the proof of ownership and the bond of\naffection.\nHe was still gazing at his extended finger when Madge began to\nspeak.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the dog,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t considered the dog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSkiff Miller looked puzzled.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you thought about him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re drivin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the response.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe the dog has some choice in the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMadge went on.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe he has his likes and\ndesires.\u00c2\u00a0 You have not considered him.\u00c2\u00a0 You give him no\nchoice.\u00c2\u00a0 It has never entered your mind that possibly he\nmight prefer California to Alaska.\u00c2\u00a0 You consider only what\nyou like.\u00c2\u00a0 You do with him as you would with a sack of\npotatoes or a bale of hay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis was a new way of looking at it, and Miller was visibly\nimpressed as he debated it in his mind.\u00c2\u00a0 Madge took\nadvantage of his indecision.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you really love him, what would be happiness to him\nwould be your happiness also,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she urged.\nSkiff Miller continued to debate with himself, and Madge stole\na glance of exultation to her husband, who looked back warm\napproval.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Klondiker suddenly\ndemanded.\nIt was her turn to be puzzled.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you\nmean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cD\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sooner stay in\nCalifornia?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nShe nodded her head with positiveness.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure\nof it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSkiff Miller again debated with himself, though this time\naloud, at the same time running his gaze in a judicial way over\nthe mooted animal.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was a good worker.\u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done a heap of\nwork for me.\u00c2\u00a0 He never loafed on me, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he was a\njoe-dandy at hammerin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a raw team into shape.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a head on him.\u00c2\u00a0 He can do everything but\ntalk.\u00c2\u00a0 He knows what you say to him.\u00c2\u00a0 Look at \u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nnow.\u00c2\u00a0 He knows we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe dog was lying at Skiff Miller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet, head close\ndown on paws, ears erect and listening, and eyes that were quick\nand eager to follow the sound of speech as it fell from the lips\nof first one and then the other.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn\u00e2\u0080\u0099 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of work in \u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nyet.\u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for years to come.\u00c2\u00a0 An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\ndo like him.\u00c2\u00a0 I like him like hell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOnce or twice after that Skiff Miller opened his mouth and\nclosed it again without speaking.\u00c2\u00a0 Finally he said:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do.\u00c2\u00a0 Your\nremarks, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am, has some weight in them.\u00c2\u00a0 The\ndog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worked hard, and maybe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earned a soft berth\nan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has got a right to choose.\u00c2\u00a0 Anyway, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nleave it up to him.\u00c2\u00a0 Whatever he says, goes.\u00c2\u00a0 You\npeople stay right here settin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 down.\u00c2\u00a0 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say\ngood-by and walk off casual-like.\u00c2\u00a0 If he wants to stay, he\ncan stay.\u00c2\u00a0 If he wants to come with me, let \u00e2\u0080\u0099m\ncome.\u00c2\u00a0 I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call \u00e2\u0080\u0099m to come an\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you call \u00e2\u0080\u0099m to come back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe looked with sudden suspicion at Madge, and added,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly you must play fair.\u00c2\u00a0 No persuadin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 after\nmy back is turned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll play fair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge began, but Skiff\nMiller broke in on her assurances.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know the ways of women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he announced.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir hearts is soft.\u00c2\u00a0 When their hearts is touched\nthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to stack the cards, look at the bottom of\nthe deck, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lie like the devil\u00e2\u0080\u0094beggin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 your\npardon, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am.\u00c2\u00a0 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m only discoursin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about\nwomen in general.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge\nquavered.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got any call to thank\nme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrown ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t decided\nyet.\u00c2\u00a0 Now you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind if I go away slow?\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no more\u00e2\u0080\u0099n fair, seein\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be out\nof sight inside a hundred yards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094Madge agreed, and\nadded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I promise you faithfully that we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do\nanything to influence him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, I might as well be gettin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nalong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Skiff Miller said in the ordinary tones of one\ndeparting.\nAt this change in his voice, Wolf lifted his head quickly, and\nstill more quickly got to his feet when the man and woman shook\nhands.\u00c2\u00a0 He sprang up on his hind legs, resting his fore paws\non her hip and at the same time licking Skiff Miller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand.\u00c2\u00a0 When the latter shook hands with Walt, Wolf repeated\nhis act, resting his weight on Walt and licking both men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhands.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t no picnic, I can tell you that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwere the Klondiker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last words, as he turned and went\nslowly up the trail.\nFor the distance of twenty feet Wolf watched him go, himself\nall eagerness and expectancy, as though waiting for the man to\nturn and retrace his steps.\u00c2\u00a0 Then, with a quick low whine,\nWolf sprang after him, overtook him, caught his hand between his\nteeth with reluctant tenderness, and strove gently to make him\npause.\nFailing in this, Wolf raced back to where Walt Irvine sat,\ncatching his coat-sleeve in his teeth and trying vainly to drag\nhim after the retreating man.\nWolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perturbation began to wax.\u00c2\u00a0 He desired\nubiquity.\u00c2\u00a0 He wanted to be in two places at the same time,\nwith the old master and the new, and steadily the distance\nbetween them was increasing.\u00c2\u00a0 He sprang about excitedly,\nmaking short nervous leaps and twists, now toward one, now toward\nthe other, in painful indecision, not knowing his own mind,\ndesiring both and unable to choose, uttering quick sharp whines\nand beginning to pant.\nHe sat down abruptly on his haunches, thrusting his nose\nupward, the mouth opening and closing with jerking movements,\neach time opening wider.\u00c2\u00a0 These jerking movements were in\nunison with the recurrent spasms that attacked the throat, each\nspasm severer and more intense than the preceding one.\u00c2\u00a0 And\nin accord with jerks and spasms the larynx began to vibrate, at\nfirst silently, accompanied by the rush of air expelled from the\nlungs, then sounding a low, deep note, the lowest in the register\nof the human ear.\u00c2\u00a0 All this was the nervous and muscular\npreliminary to howling.\nBut just as the howl was on the verge of bursting from the\nfull throat, the wide-opened mouth was closed, the paroxysms\nceased, and he looked long and steadily at the retreating\nman.\u00c2\u00a0 Suddenly Wolf turned his head, and over his shoulder\njust as steadily regarded Walt.\u00c2\u00a0 The appeal was\nunanswered.\u00c2\u00a0 Not a word nor a sign did the dog receive, no\nsuggestion and no clew as to what his conduct should be.\nA glance ahead to where the old master was nearing the curve\nof the trail excited him again.\u00c2\u00a0 He sprang to his feet with\na whine, and then, struck by a new idea, turned his attention to\nMadge.\u00c2\u00a0 Hitherto he had ignored her, but now, both masters\nfailing him, she alone was left.\u00c2\u00a0 He went over to her and\nsnuggled his head in her lap, nudging her arm with his\nnose\u00e2\u0080\u0094an old trick of his when begging for favors.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nbacked away from her and began writhing and twisting playfully,\ncurvetting and prancing, half rearing and striking his fore paws\nto the earth, struggling with all his body, from the wheedling\neyes and flattening ears to the wagging tail, to express the\nthought that was in him and that was denied him utterance.\nThis, too, he soon abandoned.\u00c2\u00a0 He was depressed by the\ncoldness of these humans who had never been cold before.\u00c2\u00a0 No\nresponse could he draw from them, no help could he get.\u00c2\u00a0\nThey did not consider him.\u00c2\u00a0 They were as dead.\nHe turned and silently gazed after the old master.\u00c2\u00a0 Skiff\nMiller was rounding the curve.\u00c2\u00a0 In a moment he would be gone\nfrom view.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet he never turned his head, plodding straight\nonward, slowly and methodically, as though possessed of no\ninterest in what was occurring behind his back.\nAnd in this fashion he went out of view.\u00c2\u00a0 Wolf waited for\nhim to reappear.\u00c2\u00a0 He waited a long minute, silently,\nquietly, without movement, as though turned to stone\u00e2\u0080\u0094withal\nstone quick with eagerness and desire.\u00c2\u00a0 He barked once, and\nwaited.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he turned and trotted back to Walt\nIrvine.\u00c2\u00a0 He sniffed his hand and dropped down heavily at his\nfeet, watching the trail where it curved emptily from view.\nThe tiny stream slipping down the mossy-lipped stone seemed\nsuddenly to increase the volume of its gurgling noise.\u00c2\u00a0 Save\nfor the meadow-larks, there was no other sound.\u00c2\u00a0 The great\nyellow butterflies drifted silently through the sunshine and lost\nthemselves in the drowsy shadows.\u00c2\u00a0 Madge gazed triumphantly\nat her husband.\nA few minutes later Wolf got upon his feet.\u00c2\u00a0 Decision and\ndeliberation marked his movements.\u00c2\u00a0 He did not glance at the\nman and woman.\u00c2\u00a0 His eyes were fixed up the trail.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nhad made up his mind.\u00c2\u00a0 They knew it.\u00c2\u00a0 And they knew, so\nfar as they were concerned, that the ordeal had just begun.\nHe broke into a trot, and Madge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips pursed, forming\nan avenue for the caressing sound that it was the will of her to\nsend forth.\u00c2\u00a0 But the caressing sound was not made.\u00c2\u00a0 She\nwas impelled to look at her husband, and she saw the sternness\nwith which he watched her.\u00c2\u00a0 The pursed lips relaxed, and she\nsighed inaudibly.\nWolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trot broke into a run.\u00c2\u00a0 Wider and wider were\nthe leaps he made.\u00c2\u00a0 Not once did he turn his head, his\nwolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brush standing out straight behind him.\u00c2\u00a0 He cut\nsharply across the curve of the trail and was gone.",
