    "name": "London - A Day's Lodging",
    "body": "John Messner clung with mittened hand to the bucking gee-pole\nand held the sled in the trail.\u00c2\u00a0 With the other mittened\nhand he rubbed his cheeks and nose.\u00c2\u00a0 He rubbed his cheeks\nand nose every little while.\u00c2\u00a0 In point of fact, he rarely\nceased from rubbing them, and sometimes, as their numbness\nincreased, he rubbed fiercely.\u00c2\u00a0 His forehead was covered by\nthe visor of his fur cap, the flaps of which went over his\nears.\u00c2\u00a0 The rest of his face was protected by a thick beard,\ngolden-brown under its coating of frost.\nBehind him churned a heavily loaded Yukon sled, and before him\ntoiled a string of five dogs.\u00c2\u00a0 The rope by which they\ndragged the sled rubbed against the side of Messner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nleg.\u00c2\u00a0 When the dogs swung on a bend in the trail, he stepped\nover the rope.\u00c2\u00a0 There were many bends, and he was compelled\nto step over it often.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes he tripped on the rope, or\nstumbled, and at all times he was awkward, betraying a weariness\nso great that the sled now and again ran upon his heels.\nWhen he came to a straight piece of trail, where the sled\ncould get along for a moment without guidance, he let go the\ngee-pole and batted his right hand sharply upon the hard\nwood.\u00c2\u00a0 He found it difficult to keep up the circulation in\nthat hand.\u00c2\u00a0 But while he pounded the one hand, he never\nceased from rubbing his nose and cheeks with the other.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too cold to travel, anyway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid.\u00c2\u00a0 He spoke aloud, after the manner of men who are much\nby themselves.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly a fool would travel at such a\ntemperature.\u00c2\u00a0 If it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eighty below, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbecause it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seventy-nine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe pulled out his watch, and after some fumbling got it back\ninto the breast pocket of his thick woollen jacket.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he\nsurveyed the heavens and ran his eye along the white sky-line to\nthe south.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwelve o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he mumbled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA clear\nsky, and no sun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe plodded on silently for ten minutes, and then, as though\nthere had been no lapse in his speech, he added:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd no ground covered, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too cold to\ntravel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSuddenly he yelled \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhoa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the dogs, and\nstopped.\u00c2\u00a0 He seemed in a wild panic over his right hand, and\nproceeded to hammer it furiously against the gee-pole.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0094poor\u00e2\u0080\u0094devils!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he addressed the\ndogs, which had dropped down heavily on the ice to rest.\u00c2\u00a0\nHis was a broken, jerky utterance, caused by the violence with\nwhich he hammered his numb hand upon the wood.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\nhave you done anyway that a two-legged other animal should come\nalong, break you to harness, curb all your natural proclivities,\nand make slave-beasts out of you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe rubbed his nose, not reflectively, but savagely, in order\nto drive the blood into it, and urged the dogs to their work\nagain.\u00c2\u00a0 He travelled on the frozen surface of a great\nriver.\u00c2\u00a0 Behind him it stretched away in a mighty curve of\nmany miles, losing itself in a fantastic jumble of mountains,\nsnow-covered and silent.\u00c2\u00a0 Ahead of him the river split into\nmany channels to accommodate the freight of islands it carried on\nits breast.\u00c2\u00a0 These islands were silent and white.\u00c2\u00a0 No\nanimals nor humming insects broke the silence.\u00c2\u00a0 No birds\nflew in the chill air.\u00c2\u00a0 There was no sound of man, no mark\nof the handiwork of man.\u00c2\u00a0 The world slept, and it was like\nthe sleep of death.\nJohn Messner seemed succumbing to the apathy of it all.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe frost was benumbing his spirit.\u00c2\u00a0 He plodded on with\nbowed head, unobservant, mechanically rubbing nose and cheeks,\nand batting his steering hand against the gee-pole in the\nstraight trail-stretches.\nBut the dogs were observant, and suddenly they stopped,\nturning their heads and looking back at their master out of eyes\nthat were wistful and questioning.\u00c2\u00a0 Their eyelashes were\nfrosted white, as were their muzzles, and they had all the\nseeming of decrepit old age, what of the frost-rime and\nexhaustion.\nThe man was about to urge them on, when he checked himself,\nroused up with an effort, and looked around.\u00c2\u00a0 The dogs had\nstopped beside a water-hole, not a fissure, but a hole man-made,\nchopped laboriously with an axe through three and a half feet of\nice.\u00c2\u00a0 A thick skin of new ice showed that it had not been\nused for some time.\u00c2\u00a0 Messner glanced about him.\u00c2\u00a0 The\ndogs were already pointing the way, each wistful and hoary muzzle\nturned toward the dim snow-path that left the main river trail\nand climbed the bank of the island.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, you sore-footed brutes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll investigate.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not\na bit more anxious to quit than I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe climbed the bank and disappeared.\u00c2\u00a0 The dogs did not\nlie down, but on their feet eagerly waited his return.\u00c2\u00a0 He\ncame back to them, took a hauling-rope from the front of the\nsled, and put it around his shoulders.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he\ngee\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the dogs to the right and put them at the bank\non the run.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a stiff pull, but their weariness fell\nfrom them as they crouched low to the snow, whining with\neagerness and gladness as they struggled upward to the last ounce\nof effort in their bodies.\u00c2\u00a0 When a dog slipped or faltered,\nthe one behind nipped his hind quarters.\u00c2\u00a0 The man shouted\nencouragement and threats, and threw all his weight on the\nhauling-rope.\nThey cleared the bank with a rush, swung to the left, and\ndashed up to a small log cabin.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a deserted cabin of\na single room, eight feet by ten on the inside.\u00c2\u00a0 Messner\nunharnessed the animals, unloaded his sled and took\npossession.\u00c2\u00a0 The last chance wayfarer had left a supply of\nfirewood.\u00c2\u00a0 Messner set up his light sheet-iron stove and\nstarted a fire.\u00c2\u00a0 He put five sun-cured salmon into the oven\nto thaw out for the dogs, and from the water-hole filled his\ncoffee-pot and cooking-pail.\nWhile waiting for the water to boil, he held his face over the\nstove.\u00c2\u00a0 The moisture from his breath had collected on his\nbeard and frozen into a great mass of ice, and this he proceeded\nto thaw out.\u00c2\u00a0 As it melted and dropped upon the stove it\nsizzled and rose about him in steam.\u00c2\u00a0 He helped the process\nwith his fingers, working loose small ice-chunks that fell\nrattling to the floor.\nA wild outcry from the dogs without did not take him from his\ntask.\u00c2\u00a0 He heard the wolfish snarling and yelping of strange\ndogs and the sound of voices.\u00c2\u00a0 A knock came on the door.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner called, in a voice muffled\nbecause at the moment he was sucking loose a fragment of ice from\nits anchorage on his upper lip.\nThe door opened, and, gazing out of his cloud of steam, he saw\na man and a woman pausing on the threshold.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said peremptorily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand shut\nthe door!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPeering through the steam, he could make out but little of\ntheir personal appearance.\u00c2\u00a0 The nose and cheek strap worn by\nthe woman and the trail-wrappings about her head allowed only a\npair of black eyes to be seen.\u00c2\u00a0 The man was dark-eyed and\nsmooth-shaven all except his mustache, which was so iced up as to\nhide his mouth.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just wanted to know if there is any other cabin\naround here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, at the same time glancing over the\nunfurnished state of the room.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe thought this cabin\nwas empty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my cabin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner answered.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just found it a few minutes ago.\u00c2\u00a0 Come right in and\ncamp.\u00c2\u00a0 Plenty of room, and you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need your\nstove.\u00c2\u00a0 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room for all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAt the sound of his voice the woman peered at him with quick\ncuriousness.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet your things off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d her companion said to\nher.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll unhitch and get the water so we can\nstart cooking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMessner took the thawed salmon outside and fed his dogs.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe had to guard them against the second team of dogs, and when he\nhad re\u00c3\u00abntered the cabin the other man had unpacked the sled\nand fetched water.\u00c2\u00a0 Messner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pot was boiling.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe threw in the coffee, settled it with half a cup of cold water,\nand took the pot from the stove.\u00c2\u00a0 He thawed some sour-dough\nbiscuits in the oven, at the same time heating a pot of beans he\nhad boiled the night before and that had ridden frozen on the\nsled all morning.\nRemoving his utensils from the stove, so as to give the\nnewcomers a chance to cook, he proceeded to take his meal from\nthe top of his grub-box, himself sitting on his bed-roll.\u00c2\u00a0\nBetween mouthfuls he talked trail and dogs with the man, who,\nwith head over the stove, was thawing the ice from his\nmustache.\u00c2\u00a0 There were two bunks in the cabin, and into one\nof them, when he had cleared his lip, the stranger tossed his\nbed-roll.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sleep here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless\nyou prefer this bunk.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the first comer and you\nhave first choice, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner answered.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne bunk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as good as the other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe spread his own bedding in the second bunk, and sat down on\nthe edge.\u00c2\u00a0 The stranger thrust a physician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small\ntravelling case under his blankets at one end to serve for a\npillow.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d came the answer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I assure you I\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come into the Klondike to practise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe woman busied herself with cooking, while the man sliced\nbacon and fired the stove.\u00c2\u00a0 The light in the cabin was dim,\nfiltering through in a small window made of onion-skin writing\npaper and oiled with bacon grease, so that John Messner could not\nmake out very well what the woman looked like.\u00c2\u00a0 Not that he\ntried.\u00c2\u00a0 He seemed to have no interest in her.\u00c2\u00a0 But she\nglanced curiously from time to time into the dark corner where he\nsat.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor\nproclaimed enthusiastically, pausing from sharpening his knife on\nthe stovepipe.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I like about it is the struggle,\nthe endeavor with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own hands, the primitiveness of it,\nthe realness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe temperature is real enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner\nlaughed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know how cold it actually is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor\ndemanded.\nThe other shook his head.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you.\u00c2\u00a0 Seventy-four below\nzero by spirit thermometer on the sled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one hundred and six below freezing\npoint\u00e2\u0080\u0094too cold for travelling, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPractically suicide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nverdict.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne exerts himself.\u00c2\u00a0 He breathes\nheavily, taking into his lungs the frost itself.\u00c2\u00a0 It chills\nhis lungs, freezes the edges of the tissues.\u00c2\u00a0 He gets a dry,\nhacking cough as the dead tissue sloughs away, and dies the\nfollowing summer of pneumonia, wondering what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all\nabout.\u00c2\u00a0 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay in this cabin for a week, unless the\nthermometer rises at least to fifty below.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, Tess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, the next moment,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think that coffee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boiled long\nenough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAt the sound of the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, John Messner became\nsuddenly alert.\u00c2\u00a0 He looked at her quickly, while across his\nface shot a haunting expression, the ghost of some buried misery\nachieving swift resurrection.\u00c2\u00a0 But the next moment, and by\nan effort of will, the ghost was laid again.\u00c2\u00a0 His face was\nas placid as before, though he was still alert, dissatisfied with\nwhat the feeble light had shown him of the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nface.\nAutomatically, her first act had been to set the coffee-pot\nback.\u00c2\u00a0 It was not until she had done this that she glanced\nat Messner.\u00c2\u00a0 But already he had composed himself.\u00c2\u00a0 She\nsaw only a man sitting on the edge of the bunk and incuriously\nstudying the toes of his moccasins.\u00c2\u00a0 But, as she turned\ncasually to go about her cooking, he shot another swift look at\nher, and she, glancing as swiftly back, caught his look.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nshifted on past her to the doctor, though the slightest smile\ncurled his lip in appreciation of the way she had trapped\nhim.\nShe drew a candle from the grub-box and lighted it.\u00c2\u00a0 One\nlook at her illuminated face was enough for Messner.\u00c2\u00a0 In the\nsmall cabin the widest limit was only a matter of several steps,\nand the next moment she was alongside of him.\u00c2\u00a0 She\ndeliberately held the candle close to his face and stared at him\nout of eyes wide with fear and recognition.\u00c2\u00a0 He smiled\nquietly back at her.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you looking for, Tess?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor\ncalled.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHairpins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, passing on and rummaging\nin a clothes-bag on the bunk.\nThey served their meal on their grub-box, sitting on\nMessner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grub-box and facing him.\u00c2\u00a0 He had stretched\nout on his bunk to rest, lying on his side, his head on his\narm.\u00c2\u00a0 In the close quarters it was as though the three were\ntogether at table.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat part of the States do you come from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMessner asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSan Francisco,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the doctor.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in here two years, though.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hail from California myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was\nMessner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement.\nThe woman looked at him appealingly, but he smiled and went\non:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBerkeley, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe other man was becoming interested.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cU. C.?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Class of \u00e2\u0080\u009986.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI meant faculty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor explained.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou remind me of the type.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry to hear you say so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner smiled\nback.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d prefer being taken for a prospector\nor a dog-musher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he looks any more like a professor\nthan you do a doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the woman broke in.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Messner.\u00c2\u00a0 Then, turning to\nher companion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the way, Doctor, what is your name, if I\nmay ask?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaythorne, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take my word for it.\u00c2\u00a0 I\ngave up cards with civilization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Mrs. Haythorne,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner smiled and\nbowed.\nShe flashed a look at him that was more anger than appeal.\nHaythorne was about to ask the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name.\u00c2\u00a0 His\nmouth had opened to form the question when Messner cut him\noff.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome to think of it, Doctor, you may possibly be able\nto satisfy my curiosity.\u00c2\u00a0 There was a sort of scandal in\nfaculty circles some two or three years ago.\u00c2\u00a0 The wife of\none of the English professors\u00e2\u0080\u0094er, if you will pardon me,\nMrs. Haythorne\u00e2\u0080\u0094disappeared with some San Francisco doctor,\nI understood, though his name does not just now come to my\nlips.\u00c2\u00a0 Do you remember the incident?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHaythorne nodded his head.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cMade quite a stir at\nthe time.\u00c2\u00a0 His name was Womble\u00e2\u0080\u0094Graham Womble.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nhad a magnificent practice.\u00c2\u00a0 I knew him somewhat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, what I was trying to get at was what had become\nof them.\u00c2\u00a0 I was wondering if you had heard.\u00c2\u00a0 They left\nno trace, hide nor hair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe covered his tracks cunningly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Haythorne\ncleared his throat.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was rumor that they went\nto the South Seas\u00e2\u0080\u0094were lost on a trading schooner in a\ntyphoon, or something like that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never heard that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner said.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou remember the case, Mrs. Haythorne?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerfectly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, in a voice the control\nof which was in amazing contrast to the anger that blazed in the\nface she turned aside so that Haythorne might not see.\nThe latter was again on the verge of asking his name, when\nMessner remarked:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Dr. Womble, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard he was very handsome,\nand\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094quite a success, so to say, with the\nladies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if he was, he finished himself off by that\naffair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haythorne grumbled.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the woman was a termagant\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least so\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been told.\u00c2\u00a0 It was generally accepted in Berkeley\nthat she made life\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094not exactly paradise for her\nhusband.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never heard that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haythorne rejoined.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn San Francisco the talk was all the other\nway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWoman sort of a martyr, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u0094crucified on the\ncross of matrimony?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe doctor nodded.\u00c2\u00a0 Messner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gray eyes were mildly\ncurious as he went on:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was to be expected\u00e2\u0080\u0094two sides to the\nshield.\u00c2\u00a0 Living in Berkeley I only got the one side.\u00c2\u00a0\nShe was a great deal in San Francisco, it seems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome coffee, please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haythorne said.\nThe woman refilled his mug, at the same time breaking into\nlight laughter.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gossiping like a pair of beldames,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe chided them.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so interesting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner smiled at\nher, then returned to the doctor.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe husband seems\nthen to have had a not very savory reputation in San\nFrancisco?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the contrary, he was a moral prig,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haythorne\nblurted out, with apparently undue warmth.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was a\nlittle scholastic shrimp without a drop of red blood in his\nbody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you know him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever laid eyes on him.\u00c2\u00a0 I never knocked about in\nuniversity circles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne side of the shield again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner said, with\nan air of weighing the matter judicially.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile he\ndid not amount to much, it is true\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is,\nphysically\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hardly say he was as bad as all\nthat.\u00c2\u00a0 He did take an active interest in student\nathletics.\u00c2\u00a0 And he had some talent.\u00c2\u00a0 He once wrote a\nNativity play that brought him quite a bit of local\nappreciation.\u00c2\u00a0 I have heard, also, that he was slated for\nthe head of the English department, only the affair happened and\nhe resigned and went away.\u00c2\u00a0 It quite broke his career, or so\nit seemed.\u00c2\u00a0 At any rate, on our side the shield, it was\nconsidered a knock-out blow to him.\u00c2\u00a0 It was thought he cared\na great deal for his wife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHaythorne, finishing his mug of coffee, grunted uninterestedly\nand lighted his pipe.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was fortunate they had no children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner\ncontinued.\nBut Haythorne, with a glance at the stove, pulled on his cap\nand mittens.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going out to get some wood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I can take off my moccasins and be\ncomfortable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe door slammed behind him.\u00c2\u00a0 For a long minute there was\nsilence.\u00c2\u00a0 The man continued in the same position on the\nbed.\u00c2\u00a0 The woman sat on the grub-box, facing him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you going to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked\nabruptly.\nMessner looked at her with lazy indecision.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\ndo you think I ought to do?\u00c2\u00a0 Nothing scenic, I hope.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou see I am stiff and trail-sore, and this bunk is so\nrestful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nShe gnawed her lower lip and fumed dumbly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began vehemently, then clenched\nher hands and stopped.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want me to kill\nMr.\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094Haythorne,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said gently, almost\npleadingly.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be most distressing, and, I\nassure you, really it is unnecessary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you must do something,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the contrary, it is quite conceivable that I do not\nhave to do anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would stay here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe nodded.\nShe glanced desperately around the cabin and at the bed\nunrolled on the other bunk.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cNight is coming\non.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop here.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\u00c2\u00a0\nI tell you, you simply can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I can.\u00c2\u00a0 I might remind you that I found\nthis cabin first and that you are my guests.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAgain her eyes travelled around the room, and the terror in\nthem leaped up at sight of the other bunk.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she announced\ndecisively.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImpossible.\u00c2\u00a0 You have a dry, hacking\ncough\u00e2\u0080\u0094the sort Mr.\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094Haythorne so aptly\ndescribed.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already slightly chilled your\nlungs.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, he is a physician and knows.\u00c2\u00a0 He would\nnever permit it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen what are you going to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she demanded\nagain, with a tense, quiet utterance that boded an outbreak.\nMessner regarded her in a way that was almost paternal, what\nof the profundity of pity and patience with which he contrived to\nsuffuse it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Theresa, as I told you before, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow.\u00c2\u00a0 I really haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thought about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00c2\u00a0 You drive me mad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 She sprang to\nher feet, wringing her hands in impotent wrath.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nnever used to be this way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI used to be all softness and gentleness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nnodded concurrence.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWas that why you left\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are so different, so dreadfully calm.\u00c2\u00a0 You\nfrighten me.\u00c2\u00a0 I feel you have something terrible planned all\nthe while.\u00c2\u00a0 But whatever you do, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything\nrash.\u00c2\u00a0 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get excited\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get excited any more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ninterrupted.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot since you went away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have improved\u00e2\u0080\u0094remarkably,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nretorted.\nHe smiled acknowledgment.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I am thinking\nabout what I shall do, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what you will have to\ndo\u00e2\u0080\u0094tell Mr.\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094Haythorne who I am.\u00c2\u00a0 It may\nmake our stay in this cabin more\u00e2\u0080\u0094may I say,\nsociable?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy have you followed me into this frightful\ncountry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked irrelevantly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I came here looking for you,\nTheresa.\u00c2\u00a0 Your vanity shall not be tickled by any such\nmisapprehension.\u00c2\u00a0 Our meeting is wholly fortuitous.\u00c2\u00a0 I\nbroke with the life academic and I had to go somewhere.\u00c2\u00a0 To\nbe honest, I came into the Klondike because I thought it the\nplace you were least liable to be in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThere was a fumbling at the latch, then the door swung in and\nHaythorne entered with an armful of firewood.\u00c2\u00a0 At the first\nwarning, Theresa began casually to clear away the dishes.\u00c2\u00a0\nHaythorne went out again after more wood.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you introduce us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner\nqueried.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, with a toss of\nher head.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nafraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never knew you to be afraid, very much, of\nanything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not afraid of confession, either,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe said, with softening face and voice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn your case, I fear, confession is exploitation by\nindirection, profit-making by ruse, self-aggrandizement at the\nexpense of God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be literary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pouted, with\ngrowing tenderness.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never did like epigrammatic\ndiscussion.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not afraid to ask you to\nforgive me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing to forgive, Theresa.\u00c2\u00a0 I really\nshould thank you.\u00c2\u00a0 True, at first I suffered; and then, with\nall the graciousness of spring, it dawned upon me that I was\nhappy, very happy.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a most amazing\ndiscovery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what if I should return to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nasked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should\u00e2\u0080\u009d (he looked at her whimsically),\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbe greatly perturbed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am your wife.\u00c2\u00a0 You know you have never got a\ndivorce.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he meditated.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been\ncareless.\u00c2\u00a0 It will be one of the first things I attend\nto.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nShe came over to his side, resting her hand on his arm.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want me, John?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Her voice was\nsoft and caressing, her hand rested like a lure.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\nI told you I had made a mistake?\u00c2\u00a0 If I told you that I was\nvery unhappy?\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I am.\u00c2\u00a0 And I did make a\nmistake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFear began to grow on Messner.\u00c2\u00a0 He felt himself wilting\nunder the lightly laid hand.\u00c2\u00a0 The situation was slipping\naway from him, all his beautiful calmness was going.\u00c2\u00a0 She\nlooked at him with melting eyes, and he, too, seemed all dew and\nmelting.\u00c2\u00a0 He felt himself on the edge of an abyss, powerless\nto withstand the force that was drawing him over.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am coming back to you, John.\u00c2\u00a0 I am coming back\nto-day . . . now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAs in a nightmare, he strove under the hand.\u00c2\u00a0 While she\ntalked, he seemed to hear, rippling softly, the song of the\nLorelei.\u00c2\u00a0 It was as though, somewhere, a piano were playing\nand the actual notes were impinging on his ear-drums.\nSuddenly he sprang to his feet, thrust her from him as her\narms attempted to clasp him, and retreated backward to the\ndoor.\u00c2\u00a0 He was in a panic.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do something desperate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI warned you not to get excited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 She\nlaughed mockingly, and went about washing the dishes.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody wants you.\u00c2\u00a0 I was just playing with you.\u00c2\u00a0\nI am happier where I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut Messner did not believe.\u00c2\u00a0 He remembered her facility\nin changing front.\u00c2\u00a0 She had changed front now.\u00c2\u00a0 It was\nexploitation by indirection.\u00c2\u00a0 She was not happy with the\nother man.\u00c2\u00a0 She had discovered her mistake.\u00c2\u00a0 The flame\nof his ego flared up at the thought.\u00c2\u00a0 She wanted to come\nback to him, which was the one thing he did not want.\u00c2\u00a0\nUnwittingly, his hand rattled the door-latch.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughed.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bite you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not running away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied with\nchild-like defiance, at the same time pulling on his\nmittens.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m only going to get some\nwater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe gathered the empty pails and cooking pots together and\nopened the door.\u00c2\u00a0 He looked back at her.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re to tell\nMr.\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094Haythorne who I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMessner broke the skin that had formed on the water-hole\nwithin the hour, and filled his pails.\u00c2\u00a0 But he did not\nreturn immediately to the cabin.\u00c2\u00a0 Leaving the pails standing\nin the trail, he walked up and down, rapidly, to keep from\nfreezing, for the frost bit into the flesh like fire.\u00c2\u00a0 His\nbeard was white with his frozen breath when the perplexed and\nfrowning brows relaxed and decision came into his face.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nhad made up his mind to his course of action, and his frigid lips\nand cheeks crackled into a chuckle over it.\u00c2\u00a0 The pails were\nalready skinned over with young ice when he picked them up and\nmade for the cabin.\nWhen he entered he found the other man waiting, standing near\nthe stove, a certain stiff awkwardness and indecision in his\nmanner.\u00c2\u00a0 Messner set down his water-pails.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlad to meet you, Graham Womble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in\nconventional tones, as though acknowledging an introduction.\nMessner did not offer his hand.\u00c2\u00a0 Womble stirred uneasily,\nfeeling for the other the hatred one is prone to feel for one he\nhas wronged.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the chap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner said in\nmarvelling accents.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well.\u00c2\u00a0 You see, I\nreally am glad to meet you.\u00c2\u00a0 I have\nbeen\u00e2\u0080\u0094er\u00e2\u0080\u0094curious to know what Theresa found in\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0094where, I may say, the attraction lay.\u00c2\u00a0 Well,\nwell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnd he looked the other up and down as a man would look a\nhorse up and down.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know how you must feel about me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Womble\nbegan.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner broke in with\nexaggerated cordiality of voice and manner.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cNever\nmind that.\u00c2\u00a0 What I want to know is how do you find\nher?\u00c2\u00a0 Up to expectations?\u00c2\u00a0 Has she worn well?\u00c2\u00a0\nLife been all a happy dream ever since?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be silly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Theresa interjected.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help being natural,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner\ncomplained.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can be expedient at the same time, and\npractical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Womble said sharply.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we want\nto know is what are you going to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMessner made a well-feigned gesture of helplessness.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.\u00c2\u00a0 It is one of those\nimpossible situations against which there can be no\nprovision.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll three of us cannot remain the night in this\ncabin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMessner nodded affirmation.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen somebody must get out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat also is incontrovertible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner\nagreed.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen three bodies cannot occupy the same\nspace at the same time, one must get out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re that one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Womble announced\ngrimly.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ten-mile pull to the next camp,\nbut you can make it all right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first flaw in your\nreasoning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the other objected.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\nnecessarily, should I be the one to get out?\u00c2\u00a0 I found this\ncabin first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Tess can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Womble\nexplained.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer lungs are already slightly\nchilled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI agree with you.\u00c2\u00a0 She can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t venture ten\nmiles of frost.\u00c2\u00a0 By all means she must remain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it is as I said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Womble announced with\nfinality.\nMessner cleared his throat.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour lungs are all\nright, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, but what of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAgain the other cleared his throat and spoke with painstaking\nand judicial slowness.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I may say, nothing of\nit, except, ah, according to your own reasoning, there is nothing\nto prevent your getting out, hitting the frost, so to speak, for\na matter of ten miles.\u00c2\u00a0 You can make it all\nright.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWomble looked with quick suspicion at Theresa and caught in\nher eyes a glint of pleased surprise.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded of her.\nShe hesitated, and a surge of anger darkened his face.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe turned upon Messner.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough of this.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop\nhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Womble squared his\nshoulders.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m running things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay anyway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the other persisted.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put you out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWomble stopped a moment to steady his voice and control\nhimself.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he spoke slowly, in a low, tense voice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here, Messner, if you refuse to get out,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll thrash you.\u00c2\u00a0 This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t California.\u00c2\u00a0\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll beat you to a jelly with my two fists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMessner shrugged his shoulders.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you do,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call a miners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meeting and see you strung up to\nthe nearest tree.\u00c2\u00a0 As you said, this is not\nCalifornia.\u00c2\u00a0 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a simple folk, these miners, and\nall I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to do will be to show them the marks of the\nbeating, tell them the truth about you, and present my claim for\nmy wife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe woman attempted to speak, but Womble turned upon her\nfiercely.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou keep out of this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.\nIn marked contrast was Messner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intrude, Theresa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhat of her anger and pent feelings, her lungs were irritated\ninto the dry, hacking cough, and with blood-suffused face and one\nhand clenched against her chest, she waited for the paroxysm to\npass.\nWomble looked gloomily at her, noting her cough.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething must be done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet her lungs can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand the exposure.\u00c2\u00a0 She\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t travel till the temperature rises.\u00c2\u00a0 And\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to give her up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMessner hemmed, cleared his throat, and hemmed again,\nsemi-apologetically, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI need some\nmoney.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nContempt showed instantly in Womble\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\u00c2\u00a0 At\nlast, beneath him in vileness, had the other sunk himself.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a fat sack of dust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Messner\nwent on.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw you unload it from the\nsled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow much do you want?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Womble demanded, with a\ncontempt in his voice equal to that in his face.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI made an estimate of the sack, and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0094ah\u00e2\u0080\u0094should say it weighed about twenty pounds.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat do you say we call it four thousand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got, man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Womble\ncried out.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the other said\nsoothingly.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe must be worth it.\u00c2\u00a0 Think what\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m giving up.\u00c2\u00a0 Surely it is a reasonable\nprice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Womble rushed across the floor\nto the gold-sack.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put this deal through\ntoo quick for me, you\u00e2\u0080\u0094you little worm!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, there you err,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the smiling\nrejoinder.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a matter of ethics isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the man\nwho gives a bribe as bad as the man who takes a bribe?\u00c2\u00a0 The\nreceiver is as bad as the thief, you know; and you needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nconsole yourself with any fictitious moral superiority concerning\nthis little deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo hell with your ethics!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the other burst\nout.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome here and watch the weighing of this\ndust.\u00c2\u00a0 I might cheat you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnd the woman, leaning against the bunk, raging and impotent,\nwatched herself weighed out in yellow dust and nuggets in the\nscales erected on the grub-box.\u00c2\u00a0 The scales were small,\nmaking necessary many weighings, and Messner with precise care\nverified each weighing.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too much silver in it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he remarked\nas he tied up the gold-sack.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\nwill run quite sixteen to the ounce.\u00c2\u00a0 You got a trifle the\nbetter of me, Womble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe handled the sack lovingly, and with due appreciation of its\npreciousness carried it out to his sled.\nReturning, he gathered his pots and pans together, packed his\ngrub-box, and rolled up his bed.\u00c2\u00a0 When the sled was lashed\nand the complaining dogs harnessed, he returned into the cabin\nfor his mittens.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-by, Tess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, standing at the open\ndoor.\nShe turned on him, struggling for speech but too frantic to\nword the passion that burned in her.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-by, Tess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated gently.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeast!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she managed to articulate.\nShe turned and tottered to the bunk, flinging herself face\ndown upon it, sobbing:\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou beasts!\u00c2\u00a0 You\nbeasts!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nJohn Messner closed the door softly behind him, and, as he\nstarted the dogs, looked back at the cabin with a great relief in\nhis face.\u00c2\u00a0 At the bottom of the bank, beside the water-hole,\nhe halted the sled.\u00c2\u00a0 He worked the sack of gold out between\nthe lashings and carried it to the water-hole.\u00c2\u00a0 Already a\nnew skin of ice had formed.\u00c2\u00a0 This he broke with his\nfist.\u00c2\u00a0 Untying the knotted mouth with his teeth, he emptied\nthe contents of the sack into the water.\u00c2\u00a0 The river was\nshallow at that point, and two feet beneath the surface he could\nsee the bottom dull-yellow in the fading light.\u00c2\u00a0 At the\nsight of it, he spat into the hole.\nHe started the dogs along the Yukon trail.\u00c2\u00a0 Whining\nspiritlessly, they were reluctant to work.\u00c2\u00a0 Clinging to the\ngee-pole with his right band and with his left rubbing cheeks and\nnose, he stumbled over the rope as the dogs swung on a bend.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMush-on, you poor, sore-footed brutes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncried.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it, mush-on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d",
