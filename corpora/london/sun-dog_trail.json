    "name": "London - The Sun-dog Trail",
    "body": "Sitka Charley smoked his pipe and gazed thoughtfully at the\nPolice Gazette illustration on the wall.\u00c2\u00a0 For half an\nhour he had been steadily regarding it, and for half an hour I\nhad been slyly watching him.\u00c2\u00a0 Something was going on in that\nmind of his, and, whatever it was, I knew it was well worth\nknowing.\u00c2\u00a0 He had lived life, and seen things, and performed\nthat prodigy of prodigies, namely, the turning of his back upon\nhis own people, and, in so far as it was possible for an Indian,\nbecoming a white man even in his mental processes.\u00c2\u00a0 As he\nphrased it himself, he had come into the warm, sat among us, by\nour fires, and become one of us.\u00c2\u00a0 He had never learned to\nread nor write, but his vocabulary was remarkable, and more\nremarkable still was the completeness with which he had assumed\nthe white man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view, the white man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nattitude toward things.\nWe had struck this deserted cabin after a hard day on\ntrail.\u00c2\u00a0 The dogs had been fed, the supper dishes washed, the\nbeds made, and we were now enjoying that most delicious hour that\ncomes each day, and but once each day, on the Alaskan trail, the\nhour when nothing intervenes between the tired body and bed save\nthe smoking of the evening pipe.\u00c2\u00a0 Some former denizen of the\ncabin had decorated its walls with illustrations torn from\nmagazines and newspapers, and it was these illustrations that had\nheld Sitka Charley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention from the moment of our\narrival two hours before.\u00c2\u00a0 He had studied them intently,\nranging from one to another and back again, and I could see that\nthere was uncertainty in his mind, and bepuzzlement.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I finally broke the silence.\nHe took the pipe from his mouth and said simply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do\nnot understand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe smoked on again, and again removed the pipe, using it to\npoint at the Police Gazette illustration.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat picture\u00e2\u0080\u0094what does it mean?\u00c2\u00a0 I do not\nunderstand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI looked at the picture.\u00c2\u00a0 A man, with a preposterously\nwicked face, his right hand pressed dramatically to his heart,\nwas falling backward to the floor.\u00c2\u00a0 Confronting him, with a\nface that was a composite of destroying angel and Adonis, was a\nman holding a smoking revolver.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne man is killing the other man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, aware\nof a distinct bepuzzlement of my own and of failure to\nexplain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Sitka Charley.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I confessed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat picture is all end,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has no beginning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLife has beginning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he objected.\nI was silenced for the moment, while his eyes wandered on to\nan adjoining decoration, a photographic reproduction of\nsomebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeda and the Swan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat picture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas no\nbeginning.\u00c2\u00a0 It has no end.\u00c2\u00a0 I do not understand\npictures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at that picture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I commanded, pointing to a\nthird decoration.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt means something.\u00c2\u00a0 Tell me\nwhat it means to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe studied it for several minutes.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe little girl is sick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said finally.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the doctor looking at her.\u00c2\u00a0 They have been up\nall night\u00e2\u0080\u0094see, the oil is low in the lamp, the first\nmorning light is coming in at the window.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a great\nsickness; maybe she will die, that is why the doctor looks so\nhard.\u00c2\u00a0 That is the mother.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a great sickness,\nbecause the mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head is on the table and she is\ncrying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you know she is crying?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\ninterrupted.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot see her face.\u00c2\u00a0 Perhaps\nshe is asleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSitka Charley looked at me in swift surprise, then back at the\npicture.\u00c2\u00a0 It was evident that he had not reasoned the\nimpression.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps she is asleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated.\u00c2\u00a0 He\nstudied it closely.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, she is not asleep.\u00c2\u00a0 The\nshoulders show that she is not asleep.\u00c2\u00a0 I have seen the\nshoulders of a woman who cried.\u00c2\u00a0 The mother is crying.\u00c2\u00a0\nIt is a very great sickness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now you understand the picture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\nHe shook his head, and asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe little\ngirl\u00e2\u0080\u0094does it die?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIt was my turn for silence.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes it die?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he reiterated.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are\na painter-man.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I do not know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I confessed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he delivered himself\ndogmatically.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn life little girl die or get\nwell.\u00c2\u00a0 Something happen in life.\u00c2\u00a0 In picture nothing\nhappen.\u00c2\u00a0 No, I do not understand pictures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHis disappointment was patent.\u00c2\u00a0 It was his desire to\nunderstand all things that white men understand, and here, in\nthis matter, he failed.\u00c2\u00a0 I felt, also, that there was\nchallenge in his attitude.\u00c2\u00a0 He was bent upon compelling me\nto show him the wisdom of pictures.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, he had\nremarkable powers of visualization.\u00c2\u00a0 I had long since\nlearned this.\u00c2\u00a0 He visualized everything.\u00c2\u00a0 He saw life\nin pictures, felt life in pictures, generalized life in pictures;\nand yet he did not understand pictures when seen through other\nmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes and expressed by those men with color and line\nupon canvas.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPictures are bits of life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe paint life as we see it.\u00c2\u00a0 For instance, Charley,\nyou are coming along the trail.\u00c2\u00a0 It is night.\u00c2\u00a0 You see\na cabin.\u00c2\u00a0 The window is lighted.\u00c2\u00a0 You look through the\nwindow for one second, or for two seconds, you see something, and\nyou go on your way.\u00c2\u00a0 You saw maybe a man writing a\nletter.\u00c2\u00a0 You saw something without beginning or end.\u00c2\u00a0\nNothing happened.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet it was a bit of life you saw.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou remember it afterward.\u00c2\u00a0 It is like a picture in your\nmemory.\u00c2\u00a0 The window is the frame of the picture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI could see that he was interested, and I knew that as I spoke\nhe had looked through the window and seen the man writing the\nletter.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a picture you have painted that I\nunderstand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a true\npicture.\u00c2\u00a0 It has much meaning.\u00c2\u00a0 It is in your cabin at\nDawson.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a faro table.\u00c2\u00a0 There are men\nplaying.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a large game.\u00c2\u00a0 The limit is\noff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you know the limit is off?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I broke in\nexcitedly, for here was where my work could be tried out on an\nunbiassed judge who knew life only, and not art, and who was a\nsheer master of reality.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, I was very proud of that\nparticular piece of work.\u00c2\u00a0 I had named it \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Last\nTurn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and I believed it to be one of the best things I had\never done.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are no chips on the table,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sitka Charley\nexplained.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe men are playing with markers.\u00c2\u00a0\nThat means the roof is the limit.\u00c2\u00a0 One man play yellow\nmarkers\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe one yellow marker worth one thousand dollars,\nmaybe two thousand dollars.\u00c2\u00a0 One man play red markers.\u00c2\u00a0\nMaybe they are worth five hundred dollars, maybe one thousand\ndollars.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a very big game.\u00c2\u00a0 Everybody play very\nhigh, up to the roof.\u00c2\u00a0 How do I know?\u00c2\u00a0 You make the\ndealer with blood little bit warm in face.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 (I was\ndelighted.)\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lookout, you make him lean forward\nin his chair.\u00c2\u00a0 Why he lean forward?\u00c2\u00a0 Why his face very\nmuch quiet?\u00c2\u00a0 Why his eyes very much bright?\u00c2\u00a0 Why dealer\nwarm with blood a little bit in the face?\u00c2\u00a0 Why all men very\nquiet?\u00e2\u0080\u0094the man with yellow markers? the man with white\nmarkers? the man with red markers?\u00c2\u00a0 Why nobody talk?\u00c2\u00a0\nBecause very much money.\u00c2\u00a0 Because last turn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you know it is the last turn?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nasked.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe king is coppered, the seven is played open,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe answered.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody bet on other cards.\u00c2\u00a0 Other\ncards all gone.\u00c2\u00a0 Everybody one mind.\u00c2\u00a0 Everybody play\nking to lose, seven to win.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe bank lose twenty thousand\ndollars, maybe bank win.\u00c2\u00a0 Yes, that picture I\nunderstand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet you do not know the end!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried\ntriumphantly.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the last turn, but the cards are\nnot yet turned.\u00c2\u00a0 In the picture they will never be\nturned.\u00c2\u00a0 Nobody will ever know who wins nor who\nloses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the men will sit there and never talk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, wonder and awe growing in his face.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the\nlookout will lean forward, and the blood will be warm in the face\nof the dealer.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a strange thing.\u00c2\u00a0 Always will\nthey sit there, always; and the cards will never be\nturned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a picture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is\nlife.\u00c2\u00a0 You have seen things like it yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe looked at me and pondered, then said, very slowly:\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, as you say, there is no end to it.\u00c2\u00a0 Nobody will\never know the end.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet is it a true thing.\u00c2\u00a0 I have\nseen it.\u00c2\u00a0 It is life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFor a long time he smoked on in silence, weighing the\npictorial wisdom of the white man and verifying it by the facts\nof life.\u00c2\u00a0 He nodded his head several times, and grunted once\nor twice.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he knocked the ashes from his pipe,\ncarefully refilled it, and after a thoughtful pause, lighted it\nagain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen have I, too, seen many pictures of life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nbegan; \u00e2\u0080\u009cpictures not painted, but seen with the eyes.\u00c2\u00a0\nI have looked at them like through the window at the man writing\nthe letter.\u00c2\u00a0 I have seen many pieces of life, without\nbeginning, without end, without understanding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWith a sudden change of position he turned his eyes full upon\nme and regarded me thoughtfully.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are a\npainter-man.\u00c2\u00a0 How would you paint this which I saw, a\npicture without beginning, the ending of which I do not\nunderstand, a piece of life with the northern lights for a candle\nand Alaska for a frame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a large canvas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I murmured.\nBut he ignored me, for the picture he had in mind was before\nhis eyes and he was seeing it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are many names for this picture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut in the picture there are many sun-dogs,\nand it comes into my mind to call it \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Sun-Dog\nTrail.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 It was a long time ago, seven years ago, the\nfall of \u00e2\u0080\u009997, when I saw the woman first time.\u00c2\u00a0 At Lake\nLinderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe.\u00c2\u00a0 I\ncame over Chilcoot Pass with two thousand letters for\nDawson.\u00c2\u00a0 I was letter carrier.\u00c2\u00a0 Everybody rush to\nKlondike at that time.\u00c2\u00a0 Many people on trail.\u00c2\u00a0 Many\npeople chop down trees and make boats.\u00c2\u00a0 Last water, snow in\nthe air, snow on the ground, ice on the lake, on the river ice in\nthe eddies.\u00c2\u00a0 Every day more snow, more ice.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe one\nday, maybe three days, maybe six days, any day maybe freeze-up\ncome, then no more water, all ice, everybody walk, Dawson six\nhundred miles, long time walk.\u00c2\u00a0 Boat go very quick.\u00c2\u00a0\nEverybody want to go boat.\u00c2\u00a0 Everybody say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Charley,\ntwo hundred dollars you take me in canoe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Charley,\nthree hundred dollars,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Charley, four hundred\ndollars.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 I say no, all the time I say no.\u00c2\u00a0 I am\nletter carrier.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn morning I get to Lake Linderman.\u00c2\u00a0 I walk all\nnight and am much tired.\u00c2\u00a0 I cook breakfast, I eat, then I\nsleep on the beach three hours.\u00c2\u00a0 I wake up.\u00c2\u00a0 It is ten\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00c2\u00a0 Snow is falling.\u00c2\u00a0 There is wind, much\nwind that blows fair.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, there is a woman who sits in\nthe snow alongside.\u00c2\u00a0 She is white woman, she is young, very\npretty, maybe she is twenty years old, maybe twenty-five years\nold.\u00c2\u00a0 She look at me.\u00c2\u00a0 I look at her.\u00c2\u00a0 She is very\ntired.\u00c2\u00a0 She is no dance-woman.\u00c2\u00a0 I see that right\naway.\u00c2\u00a0 She is good woman, and she is very tired.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are Sitka Charley,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she says.\u00c2\u00a0 I\nget up quick and roll blankets so snow does not get inside.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I go to Dawson,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she says.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098I go in your\ncanoe\u00e2\u0080\u0094how much?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not want anybody in my canoe.\u00c2\u00a0 I do not like\nto say no.\u00c2\u00a0 So I say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098One thousand\ndollars.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 Just for fun I say it, so woman cannot come\nwith me, much better than say no.\u00c2\u00a0 She look at me very hard,\nthen she says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098When you start?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 I say right\naway.\u00c2\u00a0 Then she says all right, she will give me one\nthousand dollars.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can I say?\u00c2\u00a0 I do not want the woman, yet have\nI given my word that for one thousand dollars she can come.\u00c2\u00a0\nI am surprised.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe she make fun, too, so I say,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let me see thousand dollars.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 And that woman,\nthat young woman, all alone on the trail, there in the snow, she\ntake out one thousand dollars, in greenbacks, and she put them in\nmy hand.\u00c2\u00a0 I look at money, I look at her.\u00c2\u00a0 What can I\nsay?\u00c2\u00a0 I say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, my canoe very small.\u00c2\u00a0 There is\nno room for outfit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 She laugh.\u00c2\u00a0 She says,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am great traveller.\u00c2\u00a0 This is my\noutfit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 She kick one small pack in the snow.\u00c2\u00a0\nIt is two fur robes, canvas outside, some woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothes\ninside.\u00c2\u00a0 I pick it up.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe thirty-five pounds.\u00c2\u00a0\nI am surprised.\u00c2\u00a0 She take it away from me.\u00c2\u00a0 She says,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, let us start.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 She carries pack into\ncanoe.\u00c2\u00a0 What can I say?\u00c2\u00a0 I put my blankets into\ncanoe.\u00c2\u00a0 We start.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that is the way I saw the woman first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe wind was fair.\u00c2\u00a0 I put up small sail.\u00c2\u00a0 The canoe\nwent very fast, it flew like a bird over the high waves.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe woman was much afraid.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098What for you come\nKlondike much afraid?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I ask.\u00c2\u00a0 She laugh at me, a hard\nlaugh, but she is still much afraid.\u00c2\u00a0 Also is she very\ntired.\u00c2\u00a0 I run canoe through rapids to Lake Bennett.\u00c2\u00a0\nWater very bad, and woman cry out because she is afraid.\u00c2\u00a0 We\ngo down Lake Bennett, snow, ice, wind like a gale, but woman is\nvery tired and go to sleep.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat night we make camp at Windy Arm.\u00c2\u00a0 Woman sit\nby fire and eat supper.\u00c2\u00a0 I look at her.\u00c2\u00a0 She is\npretty.\u00c2\u00a0 She fix hair.\u00c2\u00a0 There is much hair, and it is\nbrown, also sometimes it is like gold in the firelight, when she\nturn her head, so, and flashes come from it like golden\nfire.\u00c2\u00a0 The eyes are large and brown, sometimes warm like a\ncandle behind a curtain, sometimes very hard and bright like\nbroken ice when sun shines upon it.\u00c2\u00a0 When she\nsmile\u00e2\u0080\u0094how can I say?\u00e2\u0080\u0094when she smile I know white man\nlike to kiss her, just like that, when she smile.\u00c2\u00a0 She never\ndo hard work.\u00c2\u00a0 Her hands are soft, like baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand.\u00c2\u00a0 She is soft all over, like baby.\u00c2\u00a0 She is not\nthin, but round like baby; her arm, her leg, her muscles, all\nsoft and round like baby.\u00c2\u00a0 Her waist is small, and when she\nstand up, when she walk, or move her head or arm, it is\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\ndo not know the word\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it is nice to look at,\nlike\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe I say she is built on lines like the lines of a\ngood canoe, just like that, and when she move she is like the\nmovement of the good canoe sliding through still water or leaping\nthrough water when it is white and fast and angry.\u00c2\u00a0 It is\nvery good to see.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy does she come into Klondike, all alone, with plenty\nof money?\u00c2\u00a0 I do not know.\u00c2\u00a0 Next day I ask her.\u00c2\u00a0\nShe laugh and says:\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sitka Charley, that is none of\nyour business.\u00c2\u00a0 I give you one thousand dollars take me to\nDawson.\u00c2\u00a0 That only is your business.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 Next day\nafter that I ask her what is her name.\u00c2\u00a0 She laugh, then she\nsays, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mary Jones, that is my name.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 I do not\nknow her name, but I know all the time that Mary Jones is not her\nname.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very cold in canoe, and because of cold sometimes\nshe not feel good.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes she feel good and she\nsing.\u00c2\u00a0 Her voice is like a silver bell, and I feel good all\nover like when I go into church at Holy Cross Mission, and when\nshe sing I feel strong and paddle like hell.\u00c2\u00a0 Then she laugh\nand says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You think we get to Dawson before freeze-up,\nCharley?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes she sit in canoe and is thinking\nfar away, her eyes like that, all empty.\u00c2\u00a0 She does not see\nSitka Charley, nor the ice, nor the snow.\u00c2\u00a0 She is far\naway.\u00c2\u00a0 Very often she is like that, thinking far away.\u00c2\u00a0\nSometimes, when she is thinking far away, her face is not good to\nsee.\u00c2\u00a0 It looks like a face that is angry, like the face of\none man when he want to kill another man.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLast day to Dawson very bad.\u00c2\u00a0 Shore-ice in all the\neddies, mush-ice in the stream.\u00c2\u00a0 I cannot paddle.\u00c2\u00a0 The\ncanoe freeze to ice.\u00c2\u00a0 I cannot get to shore.\u00c2\u00a0 There is\nmuch danger.\u00c2\u00a0 All the time we go down Yukon in the\nice.\u00c2\u00a0 That night there is much noise of ice.\u00c2\u00a0 Then ice\nstop, canoe stop, everything stop.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us go to\nshore,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the woman says.\u00c2\u00a0 I say no, better wait.\u00c2\u00a0\nBy and by, everything start down-stream again.\u00c2\u00a0 There is\nmuch snow.\u00c2\u00a0 I cannot see.\u00c2\u00a0 At eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock at\nnight, everything stop.\u00c2\u00a0 At one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock everything\nstart again.\u00c2\u00a0 At three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock everything stop.\u00c2\u00a0\nCanoe is smashed like eggshell, but is on top of ice and cannot\nsink.\u00c2\u00a0 I hear dogs howling.\u00c2\u00a0 We wait.\u00c2\u00a0 We\nsleep.\u00c2\u00a0 By and by morning come.\u00c2\u00a0 There is no more\nsnow.\u00c2\u00a0 It is the freeze-up, and there is Dawson.\u00c2\u00a0 Canoe\nsmash and stop right at Dawson.\u00c2\u00a0 Sitka Charley has come in\nwith two thousand letters on very last water.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe woman rent a cabin on the hill, and for one week I\nsee her no more.\u00c2\u00a0 Then, one day, she come to me.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Charley,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098how do you like to work\nfor me?\u00c2\u00a0 You drive dogs, make camp, travel with\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 I say that I make too much money carrying\nletters.\u00c2\u00a0 She says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Charley, I will pay you more\nmoney.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 I tell her that pick-and-shovel man get\nfifteen dollars a day in the mines.\u00c2\u00a0 She says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098That\nis four hundred and fifty dollars a month.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 And I\nsay, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sitka Charley is no pick-and-shovel man.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0\nThen she says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I understand, Charley.\u00c2\u00a0 I will give\nyou seven hundred and fifty dollars each month.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 It\nis a good price, and I go to work for her.\u00c2\u00a0 I buy for her\ndogs and sled.\u00c2\u00a0 We travel up Klondike, up Bonanza and\nEldorado, over to Indian River, to Sulphur Creek, to Dominion,\nback across divide to Gold Bottom and to Too Much Gold, and back\nto Dawson.\u00c2\u00a0 All the time she look for something, I do not\nknow what.\u00c2\u00a0 I am puzzled.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098What thing you look\nfor?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I ask.\u00c2\u00a0 She laugh.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098You look for\ngold?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I ask.\u00c2\u00a0 She laugh.\u00c2\u00a0 Then she says,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is none of your business, Charley.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 And\nafter that I never ask any more.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has a small revolver which she carries in her\nbelt.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes, on trail, she makes practice with\nrevolver.\u00c2\u00a0 I laugh.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098What for you laugh,\nCharley?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she ask.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098What for you play with\nthat?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I say.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is no good.\u00c2\u00a0 It is too\nsmall.\u00c2\u00a0 It is for a child, a little plaything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0\nWhen we get back to Dawson she ask me to buy good revolver for\nher.\u00c2\u00a0 I buy a Colt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 44.\u00c2\u00a0 It is very heavy, but\nshe carry it in her belt all the time.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt Dawson comes the man.\u00c2\u00a0 Which way he come I do\nnot know.\u00c2\u00a0 Only do I know he is checha-quo\u00e2\u0080\u0094what\nyou call tenderfoot.\u00c2\u00a0 His hands are soft, just like\nhers.\u00c2\u00a0 He never do hard work.\u00c2\u00a0 He is soft all\nover.\u00c2\u00a0 At first I think maybe he is her husband.\u00c2\u00a0 But\nhe is too young.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, they make two beds at night.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe is maybe twenty years old.\u00c2\u00a0 His eyes blue, his hair\nyellow, he has a little mustache which is yellow.\u00c2\u00a0 His name\nis John Jones.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe he is her brother.\u00c2\u00a0 I do not\nknow.\u00c2\u00a0 I ask questions no more.\u00c2\u00a0 Only I think his name\nnot John Jones.\u00c2\u00a0 Other people call him Mr. Girvan.\u00c2\u00a0 I\ndo not think that is his name.\u00c2\u00a0 I do not think her name is\nMiss Girvan, which other people call her.\u00c2\u00a0 I think nobody\nknow their names.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne night I am asleep at Dawson.\u00c2\u00a0 He wake me\nup.\u00c2\u00a0 He says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Get the dogs ready; we\nstart.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 No more do I ask questions, so I get the dogs\nready and we start.\u00c2\u00a0 We go down the Yukon.\u00c2\u00a0 It is\nnight-time, it is November, and it is very cold\u00e2\u0080\u0094sixty-five\nbelow.\u00c2\u00a0 She is soft.\u00c2\u00a0 He is soft.\u00c2\u00a0 The cold\nbites.\u00c2\u00a0 They get tired.\u00c2\u00a0 They cry under their breaths\nto themselves.\u00c2\u00a0 By and by I say better we stop and make\ncamp.\u00c2\u00a0 But they say that they will go on.\u00c2\u00a0 Three times\nI say better to make camp and rest, but each time they say they\nwill go on.\u00c2\u00a0 After that I say nothing.\u00c2\u00a0 All the time,\nday after day, is it that way.\u00c2\u00a0 They are very soft.\u00c2\u00a0\nThey get stiff and sore.\u00c2\u00a0 They do not understand moccasins,\nand their feet hurt very much.\u00c2\u00a0 They limp, they stagger like\ndrunken people, they cry under their breaths; and all the time\nthey say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098On! on!\u00c2\u00a0 We will go on!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are like crazy people.\u00c2\u00a0 All the time do they\ngo on, and on.\u00c2\u00a0 Why do they go on?\u00c2\u00a0 I do not\nknow.\u00c2\u00a0 Only do they go on.\u00c2\u00a0 What are they after?\u00c2\u00a0\nI do not know.\u00c2\u00a0 They are not after gold.\u00c2\u00a0 There is no\nstampede.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, they spend plenty of money.\u00c2\u00a0 But I\nask questions no more.\u00c2\u00a0 I, too, go on and on, because I am\nstrong on the trail and because I am greatly paid.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe make Circle City.\u00c2\u00a0 That for which they look is\nnot there.\u00c2\u00a0 I think now that we will rest, and rest the\ndogs.\u00c2\u00a0 But we do not rest, not for one day do we rest.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says the woman to the man, \u00e2\u0080\u0098let us go\non.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 And we go on.\u00c2\u00a0 We leave the Yukon.\u00c2\u00a0 We\ncross the divide to the west and swing down into the Tanana\nCountry.\u00c2\u00a0 There are new diggings there.\u00c2\u00a0 But that for\nwhich they look is not there, and we take the back trail to\nCircle City.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a hard journey.\u00c2\u00a0 December is most\ngone.\u00c2\u00a0 The days are short.\u00c2\u00a0 It is very cold.\u00c2\u00a0 One\nmorning it is seventy below zero.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Better that we\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t travel to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098else will the\nfrost be unwarmed in the breathing and bite all the edges of our\nlungs.\u00c2\u00a0 After that we will have bad cough, and maybe next\nspring will come pneumonia.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 But they are\nchecha-quo.\u00c2\u00a0 They do not understand the trail.\u00c2\u00a0\nThey are like dead people they are so tired, but they say,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us go on.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 We go on.\u00c2\u00a0 The frost bites\ntheir lungs, and they get the dry cough.\u00c2\u00a0 They cough till\nthe tears run down their cheeks.\u00c2\u00a0 When bacon is frying they\nmust run away from the fire and cough half an hour in the\nsnow.\u00c2\u00a0 They freeze their cheeks a little bit, so that the\nskin turns black and is very sore.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, the man freezes\nhis thumb till the end is like to come off, and he must wear a\nlarge thumb on his mitten to keep it warm.\u00c2\u00a0 And sometimes,\nwhen the frost bites hard and the thumb is very cold, he must\ntake off the mitten and put the hand between his legs next to the\nskin, so that the thumb may get warm again.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe limp into Circle City, and even I, Sitka Charley, am\ntired.\u00c2\u00a0 It is Christmas Eve.\u00c2\u00a0 I dance, drink, make a\ngood time, for to-morrow is Christmas Day and we will rest.\u00c2\u00a0\nBut no.\u00c2\u00a0 It is five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the\nmorning\u00e2\u0080\u0094Christmas morning.\u00c2\u00a0 I am two hours\nasleep.\u00c2\u00a0 The man stand by my bed.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come,\nCharley,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098harness the dogs.\u00c2\u00a0 We\nstart.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave I not said that I ask questions no more?\u00c2\u00a0\nThey pay me seven hundred and fifty dollars each month.\u00c2\u00a0\nThey are my masters.\u00c2\u00a0 I am their man.\u00c2\u00a0 If they say,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Charley, come, let us start for hell,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I will\nharness the dogs, and snap the whip, and start for hell.\u00c2\u00a0 So\nI harness the dogs, and we start down the Yukon.\u00c2\u00a0 Where do\nwe go?\u00c2\u00a0 They do not say.\u00c2\u00a0 Only do they say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098On!\non!\u00c2\u00a0 We will go on!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are very weary.\u00c2\u00a0 They have travelled many\nhundreds of miles, and they do not understand the way of the\ntrail.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, their cough is very bad\u00e2\u0080\u0094the dry cough\nthat makes strong men swear and weak men cry.\u00c2\u00a0 But they go\non.\u00c2\u00a0 Every day they go on.\u00c2\u00a0 Never do they rest the\ndogs.\u00c2\u00a0 Always do they buy new dogs.\u00c2\u00a0 At every camp, at\nevery post, at every Indian village, do they cut out the tired\ndogs and put in fresh dogs.\u00c2\u00a0 They have much money, money\nwithout end, and like water they spend it.\u00c2\u00a0 They are\ncrazy?\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes I think so, for there is a devil in them\nthat drives them on and on, always on.\u00c2\u00a0 What is it that they\ntry to find?\u00c2\u00a0 It is not gold.\u00c2\u00a0 Never do they dig in the\nground.\u00c2\u00a0 I think a long time.\u00c2\u00a0 Then I think it is a man\nthey try to find.\u00c2\u00a0 But what man?\u00c2\u00a0 Never do we see the\nman.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet are they like wolves on the trail of the\nkill.\u00c2\u00a0 But they are funny wolves, soft wolves, baby wolves\nwho do not understand the way of the trail.\u00c2\u00a0 They cry aloud\nin their sleep at night.\u00c2\u00a0 In their sleep they moan and groan\nwith the pain of their weariness.\u00c2\u00a0 And in the day, as they\nstagger along the trail, they cry under their breaths.\u00c2\u00a0 They\nare funny wolves.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe pass Fort Yukon.\u00c2\u00a0 We pass Fort Hamilton.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe pass Minook.\u00c2\u00a0 January has come and nearly gone.\u00c2\u00a0 The\ndays are very short.\u00c2\u00a0 At nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock comes\ndaylight.\u00c2\u00a0 At three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock comes night.\u00c2\u00a0 And it\nis cold.\u00c2\u00a0 And even I, Sitka Charley, am tired.\u00c2\u00a0 Will we\ngo on forever this way without end?\u00c2\u00a0 I do not know.\u00c2\u00a0\nBut always do I look along the trail for that which they try to\nfind.\u00c2\u00a0 There are few people on the trail.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes we\ntravel one hundred miles and never see a sign of life.\u00c2\u00a0 It\nis very quiet.\u00c2\u00a0 There is no sound.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes it snows,\nand we are like wandering ghosts.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes it is clear,\nand at midday the sun looks at us for a moment over the hills to\nthe south.\u00c2\u00a0 The northern lights flame in the sky, and the\nsun-dogs dance, and the air is filled with frost-dust.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am Sitka Charley, a strong man.\u00c2\u00a0 I was born on\nthe trail, and all my days have I lived on the trail.\u00c2\u00a0 And\nyet have these two baby wolves made me very tired.\u00c2\u00a0 I am\nlean, like a starved cat, and I am glad of my bed at night, and\nin the morning am I greatly weary.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet ever are we hitting\nthe trail in the dark before daylight, and still on the trail\ndoes the dark after nightfall find us.\u00c2\u00a0 These two baby\nwolves!\u00c2\u00a0 If I am lean like a starved cat, they are lean like\ncats that have never eaten and have died.\u00c2\u00a0 Their eyes are\nsunk deep in their heads, bright sometimes as with fever, dim and\ncloudy sometimes like the eyes of the dead.\u00c2\u00a0 Their cheeks\nare hollow like caves in a cliff.\u00c2\u00a0 Also are their cheeks\nblack and raw from many freezings.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes it is the\nwoman in the morning who says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot get up.\u00c2\u00a0 I\ncannot move.\u00c2\u00a0 Let me die.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 And it is the man who\nstands beside her and says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, let us go\non.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 And they go on.\u00c2\u00a0 And sometimes it is the\nman who cannot get up, and the woman says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, let us go\non.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 But the one thing they do, and always do, is to\ngo on.\u00c2\u00a0 Always do they go on.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes, at the trading posts, the man and woman get\nletters.\u00c2\u00a0 I do not know what is in the letters.\u00c2\u00a0 But it\nis the scent that they follow, these letters themselves are the\nscent.\u00c2\u00a0 One time an Indian gives them a letter.\u00c2\u00a0 I talk\nwith him privately.\u00c2\u00a0 He says it is a man with one eye who\ngives him the letter, a man who travels fast down the\nYukon.\u00c2\u00a0 That is all.\u00c2\u00a0 But I know that the baby wolves\nare after the man with the one eye.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is February, and we have travelled fifteen hundred\nmiles.\u00c2\u00a0 We are getting near Bering Sea, and there are storms\nand blizzards.\u00c2\u00a0 The going is hard.\u00c2\u00a0 We come to\nAnvig.\u00c2\u00a0 I do not know, but I think sure they get a letter at\nAnvig, for they are much excited, and they say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come,\nhurry, let us go on.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 But I say we must buy grub, and\nthey say we must travel light and fast.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, they say that\nwe can get grub at Charley McKeon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cabin.\u00c2\u00a0 Then do I\nknow that they take the big cut-off, for it is there that Charley\nMcKeon lives where the Black Rock stands by the trail.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore we start, I talk maybe two minutes with the\npriest at Anvig.\u00c2\u00a0 Yes, there is a man with one eye who has\ngone by and who travels fast.\u00c2\u00a0 And I know that for which\nthey look is the man with the one eye.\u00c2\u00a0 We leave Anvig with\nlittle grub, and travel light and fast.\u00c2\u00a0 There are three\nfresh dogs bought in Anvig, and we travel very fast.\u00c2\u00a0 The\nman and woman are like mad.\u00c2\u00a0 We start earlier in the\nmorning, we travel later at night.\u00c2\u00a0 I look sometimes to see\nthem die, these two baby wolves, but they will not die.\u00c2\u00a0\nThey go on and on.\u00c2\u00a0 When the dry cough take hold of them\nhard, they hold their hands against their stomach and double up\nin the snow, and cough, and cough, and cough.\u00c2\u00a0 They cannot\nwalk, they cannot talk.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe for ten minutes they cough,\nmaybe for half an hour, and then they straighten up, the tears\nfrom the coughing frozen on their faces, and the words they say\nare, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, let us go on.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven I, Sitka Charley, am greatly weary, and I think\nseven hundred and fifty dollars is a cheap price for the labor I\ndo.\u00c2\u00a0 We take the big cut-off, and the trail is fresh.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe baby wolves have their noses down to the trail, and they say,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hurry!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 All the time do they say,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hurry!\u00c2\u00a0 Faster!\u00c2\u00a0 Faster!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 It is hard\non the dogs.\u00c2\u00a0 We have not much food and we cannot give them\nenough to eat, and they grow weak.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, they must work\nhard.\u00c2\u00a0 The woman has true sorrow for them, and often,\nbecause of them, the tears are in her eyes.\u00c2\u00a0 But the devil\nin her that drives her on will not let her stop and rest the\ndogs.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then we come upon the man with the one eye.\u00c2\u00a0\nHe is in the snow by the trail, and his leg is broken.\u00c2\u00a0\nBecause of the leg he has made a poor camp, and has been lying on\nhis blankets for three days and keeping a fire going.\u00c2\u00a0 When\nwe find him he is swearing.\u00c2\u00a0 He swears like hell.\u00c2\u00a0\nNever have I heard a man swear like that man.\u00c2\u00a0 I am\nglad.\u00c2\u00a0 Now that they have found that for which they look, we\nwill have rest.\u00c2\u00a0 But the woman says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us\nstart.\u00c2\u00a0 Hurry!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am surprised.\u00c2\u00a0 But the man with the one eye\nsays, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Never mind me.\u00c2\u00a0 Give me your grub.\u00c2\u00a0 You\nwill get more grub at McKeon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cabin to-morrow.\u00c2\u00a0 Send\nMcKeon back for me.\u00c2\u00a0 But do you go on.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 Here is\nanother wolf, an old wolf, and he, too, thinks but the one\nthought, to go on.\u00c2\u00a0 So we give him our grub, which is not\nmuch, and we chop wood for his fire, and we take his strongest\ndogs and go on.\u00c2\u00a0 We left the man with one eye there in the\nsnow, and he died there in the snow, for McKeon never went back\nfor him.\u00c2\u00a0 And who that man was, and why he came to be there,\nI do not know.\u00c2\u00a0 But I think he was greatly paid by the man\nand the woman, like me, to do their work for them.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat day and that night we had nothing to eat, and all\nnext day we travelled fast, and we were weak with hunger.\u00c2\u00a0\nThen we came to the Black Rock, which rose five hundred feet\nabove the trail.\u00c2\u00a0 It was at the end of the day.\u00c2\u00a0\nDarkness was coming, and we could not find the cabin of\nMcKeon.\u00c2\u00a0 We slept hungry, and in the morning looked for the\ncabin.\u00c2\u00a0 It was not there, which was a strange thing, for\neverybody knew that McKeon lived in a cabin at Black Rock.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe were near to the coast, where the wind blows hard and there is\nmuch snow.\u00c2\u00a0 Everywhere there were small hills of snow where\nthe wind had piled it up.\u00c2\u00a0 I have a thought, and I dig in\none and another of the hills of snow.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon I find the walls\nof the cabin, and I dig down to the door.\u00c2\u00a0 I go\ninside.\u00c2\u00a0 McKeon is dead.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe two or three weeks he\nis dead.\u00c2\u00a0 A sickness had come upon him so that he could not\nleave the cabin.\u00c2\u00a0 The wind and the snow had covered the\ncabin.\u00c2\u00a0 He had eaten his grub and died.\u00c2\u00a0 I looked for\nhis cache, but there was no grub in it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us go on,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the woman.\u00c2\u00a0 Her\neyes were hungry, and her hand was upon her heart, as with the\nhurt of something inside.\u00c2\u00a0 She bent back and forth like a\ntree in the wind as she stood there.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, let us go\non,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the man.\u00c2\u00a0 His voice was hollow, like the\nklonk of an old raven, and he was hunger-mad.\u00c2\u00a0 His\neyes were like live coals of fire, and as his body rocked to and\nfro, so rocked his soul inside.\u00c2\u00a0 And I, too, said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us go on.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 For that one thought, laid upon\nme like a lash for every mile of fifteen hundred miles, had\nburned itself into my soul, and I think that I, too, was\nmad.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, we could only go on, for there was no\ngrub.\u00c2\u00a0 And we went on, giving no thought to the man with the\none eye in the snow.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is little travel on the big cut-off.\u00c2\u00a0\nSometimes two or three months and nobody goes by.\u00c2\u00a0 The snow\nhad covered the trail, and there was no sign that men had ever\ncome or gone that way.\u00c2\u00a0 All day the wind blew and the snow\nfell, and all day we travelled, while our stomachs gnawed their\ndesire and our bodies grew weaker with every step they\ntook.\u00c2\u00a0 Then the woman began to fall.\u00c2\u00a0 Then the\nman.\u00c2\u00a0 I did not fall, but my feet were heavy and I caught my\ntoes and stumbled many times.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat night is the end of February.\u00c2\u00a0 I kill three\nptarmigan with the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revolver, and we are made\nsomewhat strong again.\u00c2\u00a0 But the dogs have nothing to\neat.\u00c2\u00a0 They try to eat their harness, which is of leather and\nwalrus-hide, and I must fight them off with a club and hang all\nthe harness in a tree.\u00c2\u00a0 And all night they howl and fight\naround that tree.\u00c2\u00a0 But we do not mind.\u00c2\u00a0 We sleep like\ndead people, and in the morning get up like dead people out of\ntheir graves and go on along the trail.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat morning is the 1st of March, and on that morning I\nsee the first sign of that after which the baby wolves are in\nsearch.\u00c2\u00a0 It is clear weather, and cold.\u00c2\u00a0 The sun stay\nlonger in the sky, and there are sun-dogs flashing on either\nside, and the air is bright with frost-dust.\u00c2\u00a0 The snow falls\nno more upon the trail, and I see the fresh sign of dogs and\nsled.\u00c2\u00a0 There is one man with that outfit, and I see in the\nsnow that he is not strong.\u00c2\u00a0 He, too, has not enough to\neat.\u00c2\u00a0 The young wolves see the fresh sign, too, and they are\nmuch excited.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hurry!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 they say.\u00c2\u00a0 All the\ntime they say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hurry!\u00c2\u00a0 Faster, Charley,\nfaster!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe make hurry very slow.\u00c2\u00a0 All the time the man and\nthe woman fall down.\u00c2\u00a0 When they try to ride on sled the dogs\nare too weak, and the dogs fall down.\u00c2\u00a0 Besides, it is so\ncold that if they ride on the sled they will freeze.\u00c2\u00a0 It is\nvery easy for a hungry man to freeze.\u00c2\u00a0 When the woman fall\ndown, the man help her up.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes the woman help the man\nup.\u00c2\u00a0 By and by both fall down and cannot get up, and I must\nhelp them up all the time, else they will not get up and will die\nthere in the snow.\u00c2\u00a0 This is very hard work, for I am greatly\nweary, and as well I must drive the dogs, and the man and woman\nare very heavy with no strength in their bodies.\u00c2\u00a0 So, by and\nby, I, too, fall down in the snow, and there is no one to help me\nup.\u00c2\u00a0 I must get up by myself.\u00c2\u00a0 And always do I get up\nby myself, and help them up, and make the dogs go on.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat night I get one ptarmigan, and we are very\nhungry.\u00c2\u00a0 And that night the man says to me, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What time\nstart to-morrow, Charley?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 It is like the voice of a\nghost.\u00c2\u00a0 I say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098All the time you make start at five\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098To-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he says,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098we will start at three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 I laugh\nin great bitterness, and I say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are dead\nman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 And he says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098To-morrow we will start at\nthree o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we start at three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, for I am their\nman, and that which they say is to be done, I do.\u00c2\u00a0 It is\nclear and cold, and there is no wind.\u00c2\u00a0 When daylight comes\nwe can see a long way off.\u00c2\u00a0 And it is very quiet.\u00c2\u00a0 We\ncan hear no sound but the beat of our hearts, and in the silence\nthat is a very loud sound.\u00c2\u00a0 We are like sleep-walkers, and\nwe walk in dreams until we fall down; and then we know we must\nget up, and we see the trail once more and bear the beating of\nour hearts.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes, when I am walking in dreams this\nway, I have strange thoughts.\u00c2\u00a0 Why does Sitka Charley live?\nI ask myself.\u00c2\u00a0 Why does Sitka Charley work hard, and go\nhungry, and have all this pain?\u00c2\u00a0 For seven hundred and fifty\ndollars a month, I make the answer, and I know it is a foolish\nanswer.\u00c2\u00a0 Also is it a true answer.\u00c2\u00a0 And after that\nnever again do I care for money.\u00c2\u00a0 For that day a large\nwisdom came to me.\u00c2\u00a0 There was a great light, and I saw\nclear, and I knew that it was not for money that a man must live,\nbut for a happiness that no man can give, or buy, or sell, and\nthat is beyond all value of all money in the world.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the morning we come upon the last-night camp of the\nman who is before us.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a poor camp, the kind a man\nmakes who is hungry and without strength.\u00c2\u00a0 On the snow there\nare pieces of blanket and of canvas, and I know what has\nhappened.\u00c2\u00a0 His dogs have eaten their harness, and he has\nmade new harness out of his blankets.\u00c2\u00a0 The man and woman\nstare hard at what is to be seen, and as I look at them my back\nfeels the chill as of a cold wind against the skin.\u00c2\u00a0 Their\neyes are toil-mad and hunger-mad, and burn like fire deep in\ntheir heads.\u00c2\u00a0 Their faces are like the faces of people who\nhave died of hunger, and their cheeks are black with the dead\nflesh of many freezings.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us go on,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says\nthe man.\u00c2\u00a0 But the woman coughs and falls in the snow.\u00c2\u00a0\nIt is the dry cough where the frost has bitten the lungs.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor a long time she coughs, then like a woman crawling out of her\ngrave she crawls to her feet.\u00c2\u00a0 The tears are ice upon her\ncheeks, and her breath makes a noise as it comes and goes, and\nshe says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us go on.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe go on.\u00c2\u00a0 And we walk in dreams through the\nsilence.\u00c2\u00a0 And every time we walk is a dream and we are\nwithout pain; and every time we fall down is an awakening, and we\nsee the snow and the mountains and the fresh trail of the man who\nis before us, and we know all our pain again.\u00c2\u00a0 We come to\nwhere we can see a long way over the snow, and that for which\nthey look is before them.\u00c2\u00a0 A mile away there are black spots\nupon the snow.\u00c2\u00a0 The black spots move.\u00c2\u00a0 My eyes are dim,\nand I must stiffen my soul to see.\u00c2\u00a0 And I see one man with\ndogs and a sled.\u00c2\u00a0 The baby wolves see, too.\u00c2\u00a0 They can\nno longer talk, but they whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u0098On, on.\u00c2\u00a0 Let us\nhurry!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they fall down, but they go on.\u00c2\u00a0 The man who\nis before us, his blanket harness breaks often, and he must stop\nand mend it.\u00c2\u00a0 Our harness is good, for I have hung it in\ntrees each night.\u00c2\u00a0 At eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock the man is half a\nmile away.\u00c2\u00a0 At one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock he is a quarter of a mile\naway.\u00c2\u00a0 He is very weak.\u00c2\u00a0 We see him fall down many\ntimes in the snow.\u00c2\u00a0 One of his dogs can no longer travel,\nand he cuts it out of the harness.\u00c2\u00a0 But he does not kill\nit.\u00c2\u00a0 I kill it with the axe as I go by, as I kill one of my\ndogs which loses its legs and can travel no more.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow we are three hundred yards away.\u00c2\u00a0 We go very\nslow.\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe in two, three hours we go one mile.\u00c2\u00a0 We do\nnot walk.\u00c2\u00a0 All the time we fall down.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand up and\nstagger two steps, maybe three steps, then we fall down\nagain.\u00c2\u00a0 And all the time I must help up the man and\nwoman.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes they rise to their knees and fall forward,\nmaybe four or five times before they can get to their feet again\nand stagger two or three steps and fall.\u00c2\u00a0 But always do they\nfall forward.\u00c2\u00a0 Standing or kneeling, always do they fall\nforward, gaining on the trail each time by the length of their\nbodies.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes they crawl on hands and knees like animals\nthat live in the forest.\u00c2\u00a0 We go like snails, like snails\nthat are dying we go so slow.\u00c2\u00a0 And yet we go faster than the\nman who is before us.\u00c2\u00a0 For he, too, falls all the time, and\nthere is no Sitka Charley to lift him up.\u00c2\u00a0 Now he is two\nhundred yards away.\u00c2\u00a0 After a long time he is one hundred\nyards away.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a funny sight.\u00c2\u00a0 I want to laugh out loud,\nHa! ha! just like that, it is so funny.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a race of\ndead men and dead dogs.\u00c2\u00a0 It is like in a dream when you have\na nightmare and run away very fast for your life and go very\nslow.\u00c2\u00a0 The man who is with me is mad.\u00c2\u00a0 The woman is\nmad.\u00c2\u00a0 I am mad.\u00c2\u00a0 All the world is mad, and I want to\nlaugh, it is so funny.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stranger-man who is before us leaves his dogs\nbehind and goes on alone across the snow.\u00c2\u00a0 After a long time\nwe come to the dogs.\u00c2\u00a0 They lie helpless in the snow, their\nharness of blanket and canvas on them, the sled behind them, and\nas we pass them they whine to us and cry like babies that are\nhungry.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we, too, leave our dogs and go on alone across the\nsnow.\u00c2\u00a0 The man and the woman are nearly gone, and they moan\nand groan and sob, but they go on.\u00c2\u00a0 I, too, go on.\u00c2\u00a0 I\nhave but one thought.\u00c2\u00a0 It is to come up to the\nstranger-man.\u00c2\u00a0 Then it is that I shall rest, and not until\nthen shall I rest, and it seems that I must lie down and sleep\nfor a thousand years, I am so tired.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stranger-man is fifty yards away, all alone in the\nwhite snow.\u00c2\u00a0 He falls and crawls, staggers, and falls and\ncrawls again.\u00c2\u00a0 He is like an animal that is sore wounded and\ntrying to run from the hunter.\u00c2\u00a0 By and by he crawls on hands\nand knees.\u00c2\u00a0 He no longer stands up.\u00c2\u00a0 And the man and\nwoman no longer stand up.\u00c2\u00a0 They, too, crawl after him on\nhands and knees.\u00c2\u00a0 But I stand up.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes I fall,\nbut always do I stand up again.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a strange thing to see.\u00c2\u00a0 All about is the\nsnow and the silence, and through it crawl the man and the woman,\nand the stranger-man who goes before.\u00c2\u00a0 On either side the\nsun are sun-dogs, so that there are three suns in the sky.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe frost-dust is like the dust of diamonds, and all the air is\nfilled with it.\u00c2\u00a0 Now the woman coughs, and lies still in the\nsnow until the fit has passed, when she crawls on again.\u00c2\u00a0\nNow the man looks ahead, and he is blear-eyed as with old age and\nmust rub his eyes so that he can see the stranger-man.\u00c2\u00a0 And\nnow the stranger-man looks back over his shoulder.\u00c2\u00a0 And\nSitka Charley, standing upright, maybe falls down and stands\nupright again.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter a long time the stranger-man crawls no\nmore.\u00c2\u00a0 He stands slowly upon his feet and rocks back and\nforth.\u00c2\u00a0 Also does he take off one mitten and wait with\nrevolver in his hand, rocking back and forth as he waits.\u00c2\u00a0\nHis face is skin and bones and frozen black.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a hungry\nface.\u00c2\u00a0 The eyes are deep-sunk in his head, and the lips are\nsnarling.\u00c2\u00a0 The man and woman, too, get upon their feet and\nthey go toward him very slowly.\u00c2\u00a0 And all about is the snow\nand the silence.\u00c2\u00a0 And in the sky are three suns, and all the\nair is flashing with the dust of diamonds.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd thus it was that I, Sitka Charley, saw the baby\nwolves make their kill.\u00c2\u00a0 No word is spoken.\u00c2\u00a0 Only does\nthe stranger-man snarl with his hungry face.\u00c2\u00a0 Also does he\nrock to and fro, his shoulders drooping, his knees bent, and his\nlegs wide apart so that he does not fall down.\u00c2\u00a0 The man and\nthe woman stop maybe fifty feet away.\u00c2\u00a0 Their legs, too, are\nwide apart so that they do not fall down, and their bodies rock\nto and fro.\u00c2\u00a0 The stranger-man is very weak.\u00c2\u00a0 His arm\nshakes, so that when he shoots at the man his bullet strikes in\nthe snow.\u00c2\u00a0 The man cannot take off his mitten.\u00c2\u00a0 The\nstranger-man shoots at him again, and this time the bullet goes\nby in the air.\u00c2\u00a0 Then the man takes the mitten in his teeth\nand pulls it off.\u00c2\u00a0 But his hand is frozen and he cannot hold\nthe revolver, and it fails in the snow.\u00c2\u00a0 I look at the\nwoman.\u00c2\u00a0 Her mitten is off, and the big Colt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revolver\nis in her hand.\u00c2\u00a0 Three times she shoot, quick, just like\nthat.\u00c2\u00a0 The hungry face of the stranger-man is still snarling\nas he falls forward into the snow.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey do not look at the dead man.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us\ngo on,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 they say.\u00c2\u00a0 And we go on.\u00c2\u00a0 But now that\nthey have found that for which they look, they are like\ndead.\u00c2\u00a0 The last strength has gone out of them.\u00c2\u00a0 They\ncan stand no more upon their feet.\u00c2\u00a0 They will not crawl, but\ndesire only to close their eyes and sleep.\u00c2\u00a0 I see not far\naway a place for camp.\u00c2\u00a0 I kick them.\u00c2\u00a0 I have my\ndog-whip, and I give them the lash of it.\u00c2\u00a0 They cry aloud,\nbut they must crawl.\u00c2\u00a0 And they do crawl to the place for\ncamp.\u00c2\u00a0 I build fire so that they will not freeze.\u00c2\u00a0 Then\nI go back for sled.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, I kill the dogs of the\nstranger-man so that we may have food and not die.\u00c2\u00a0 I put\nthe man and woman in blankets and they sleep.\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes I\nwake them and give them little bit of food.\u00c2\u00a0 They are not\nawake, but they take the food.\u00c2\u00a0 The woman sleep one day and\na half.\u00c2\u00a0 Then she wake up and go to sleep again.\u00c2\u00a0 The\nman sleep two days and wake up and go to sleep again.\u00c2\u00a0 After\nthat we go down to the coast at St. Michaels.\u00c2\u00a0 And when the\nice goes out of Bering Sea, the man and woman go away on a\nsteamship.\u00c2\u00a0 But first they pay me my seven hundred and fifty\ndollars a month.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, they make me a present of one\nthousand dollars.\u00c2\u00a0 And that was the year that Sitka Charley\ngave much money to the Mission at Holy Cross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why did they kill the man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\nSitka Charley delayed reply until he had lighted his\npipe.\u00c2\u00a0 He glanced at the Police Gazette illustration\nand nodded his head at it familiarly.\u00c2\u00a0 Then he said,\nspeaking slowly and ponderingly:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have thought much.\u00c2\u00a0 I do not know.\u00c2\u00a0 It is\nsomething that happened.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a picture I remember.\u00c2\u00a0\nIt is like looking in at the window and seeing the man writing a\nletter.\u00c2\u00a0 They came into my life and they went out of my\nlife, and the picture is as I have said, without beginning, the\nend without understanding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have painted many pictures in the telling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nsaid.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he nodded his head.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they\nwere without beginning and without end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe last picture of all had an end,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what\nend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a piece of life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a piece of\nlife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",
