    "name": "Chesterton - The Wrong Shape",
    "body": "\n      Certain of the great roads going north out of London continue far into the\n      country a sort of attenuated and interrupted spectre of a street, with\n      great gaps in the building, but preserving the line. Here will be a group\n      of shops, followed by a fenced field or paddock, and then a famous\n      public-house, and then perhaps a market garden or a nursery garden, and\n      then one large private house, and then another field and another inn, and\n      so on. If anyone walks along one of these roads he will pass a house which\n      will probably catch his eye, though he may not be able to explain its\n      attraction. It is a long, low house, running parallel with the road,\n      painted mostly white and pale green, with a veranda and sun-blinds, and\n      porches capped with those quaint sort of cupolas like wooden umbrellas\n      that one sees in some old-fashioned houses. In fact, it is an\n      old-fashioned house, very English and very suburban in the good old\n      wealthy Clapham sense. And yet the house has a look of having been built\n      chiefly for the hot weather. Looking at its white paint and sun-blinds one\n      thinks vaguely of pugarees and even of palm trees. I cannot trace the\n      feeling to its root; perhaps the place was built by an Anglo-Indian.\n    \n\n      Anyone passing this house, I say, would be namelessly fascinated by it;\n      would feel that it was a place about which some story was to be told. And\n      he would have been right, as you shall shortly hear. For this is the story\u2014the\n      story of the strange things that did really happen in it in the\n      Whitsuntide of the year 18\u2014:\n    \n\n      Anyone passing the house on the Thursday before Whit-Sunday at about\n      half-past four p.m. would have seen the front door open, and Father Brown,\n      of the small church of St. Mungo, come out smoking a large pipe in company\n      with a very tall French friend of his called Flambeau, who was smoking a\n      very small cigarette. These persons may or may not be of interest to the\n      reader, but the truth is that they were not the only interesting things\n      that were displayed when the front door of the white-and-green house was\n      opened. There are further peculiarities about this house, which must be\n      described to start with, not only that the reader may understand this\n      tragic tale, but also that he may realise what it was that the opening of\n      the door revealed.\n    \n\n      The whole house was built upon the plan of a T, but a T with a very long\n      cross piece and a very short tail piece. The long cross piece was the\n      frontage that ran along in face of the street, with the front door in the\n      middle; it was two stories high, and contained nearly all the important\n      rooms. The short tail piece, which ran out at the back immediately\n      opposite the front door, was one story high, and consisted only of two\n      long rooms, the one leading into the other. The first of these two rooms\n      was the study in which the celebrated Mr. Quinton wrote his wild Oriental\n      poems and romances. The farther room was a glass conservatory full of\n      tropical blossoms of quite unique and almost monstrous beauty, and on such\n      afternoons as these glowing with gorgeous sunlight. Thus when the hall\n      door was open, many a passer-by literally stopped to stare and gasp; for\n      he looked down a perspective of rich apartments to something really like a\n      transformation scene in a fairy play: purple clouds and golden suns and\n      crimson stars that were at once scorchingly vivid and yet transparent and\n      far away.\n    \n\n      Leonard Quinton, the poet, had himself most carefully arranged this\n      effect; and it is doubtful whether he so perfectly expressed his\n      personality in any of his poems. For he was a man who drank and bathed in\n      colours, who indulged his lust for colour somewhat to the neglect of form\u2014even\n      of good form. This it was that had turned his genius so wholly to eastern\n      art and imagery; to those bewildering carpets or blinding embroideries in\n      which all the colours seem fallen into a fortunate chaos, having nothing\n      to typify or to teach. He had attempted, not perhaps with complete\n      artistic success, but with acknowledged imagination and invention, to\n      compose epics and love stories reflecting the riot of violent and even\n      cruel colour; tales of tropical heavens of burning gold or blood-red\n      copper; of eastern heroes who rode with twelve-turbaned mitres upon\n      elephants painted purple or peacock green; of gigantic jewels that a\n      hundred negroes could not carry, but which burned with ancient and\n      strange-hued fires.\n    \n\n      In short (to put the matter from the more common point of view), he dealt\n      much in eastern heavens, rather worse than most western hells; in eastern\n      monarchs, whom we might possibly call maniacs; and in eastern jewels which\n      a Bond Street jeweller (if the hundred staggering negroes brought them\n      into his shop) might possibly not regard as genuine. Quinton was a genius,\n      if a morbid one; and even his morbidity appeared more in his life than in\n      his work. In temperament he was weak and waspish, and his health had\n      suffered heavily from oriental experiments with opium. His wife\u2014a\n      handsome, hard-working, and, indeed, over-worked woman objected to the\n      opium, but objected much more to a live Indian hermit in white and yellow\n      robes, whom her husband insisted on entertaining for months together, a\n      Virgil to guide his spirit through the heavens and the hells of the east.\n    \n\n      It was out of this artistic household that Father Brown and his friend\n      stepped on to the door-step; and to judge from their faces, they stepped\n      out of it with much relief. Flambeau had known Quinton in wild student\n      days in Paris, and they had renewed the acquaintance for a week-end; but\n      apart from Flambeau\u2019s more responsible developments of late, he did not\n      get on well with the poet now. Choking oneself with opium and writing\n      little erotic verses on vellum was not his notion of how a gentleman\n      should go to the devil. As the two paused on the door-step, before taking\n      a turn in the garden, the front garden gate was thrown open with violence,\n      and a young man with a billycock hat on the back of his head tumbled up\n      the steps in his eagerness. He was a dissipated-looking youth with a\n      gorgeous red necktie all awry, as if he had slept in it, and he kept\n      fidgeting and lashing about with one of those little jointed canes.\n    \n\n      \u201cI say,\u201d he said breathlessly, \u201cI want to see old Quinton. I must see him.\n      Has he gone?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cMr. Quinton is in, I believe,\u201d said Father Brown, cleaning his pipe, \u201cbut\n      I do not know if you can see him. The doctor is with him at present.\u201d\n     \n\n      The young man, who seemed not to be perfectly sober, stumbled into the\n      hall; and at the same moment the doctor came out of Quinton\u2019s study,\n      shutting the door and beginning to put on his gloves.\n    \n\n      \u201cSee Mr. Quinton?\u201d said the doctor coolly. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t. In\n      fact, you mustn\u2019t on any account. Nobody must see him; I\u2019ve just given him\n      his sleeping draught.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNo, but look here, old chap,\u201d said the youth in the red tie, trying\n      affectionately to capture the doctor by the lapels of his coat. \u201cLook\n      here. I\u2019m simply sewn up, I tell you. I\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIt\u2019s no good, Mr. Atkinson,\u201d said the doctor, forcing him to fall back;\n      \u201cwhen you can alter the effects of a drug I\u2019ll alter my decision,\u201d and,\n      settling on his hat, he stepped out into the sunlight with the other two.\n      He was a bull-necked, good-tempered little man with a small moustache,\n      inexpressibly ordinary, yet giving an impression of capacity.\n    \n\n      The young man in the billycock, who did not seem to be gifted with any\n      tact in dealing with people beyond the general idea of clutching hold of\n      their coats, stood outside the door, as dazed as if he had been thrown out\n      bodily, and silently watched the other three walk away together through\n      the garden.\n    \n\n      \u201cThat was a sound, spanking lie I told just now,\u201d remarked the medical\n      man, laughing. \u201cIn point of fact, poor Quinton doesn\u2019t have his sleeping\n      draught for nearly half an hour. But I\u2019m not going to have him bothered\n      with that little beast, who only wants to borrow money that he wouldn\u2019t\n      pay back if he could. He\u2019s a dirty little scamp, though he is Mrs.\n      Quinton\u2019s brother, and she\u2019s as fine a woman as ever walked.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said Father Brown. \u201cShe\u2019s a good woman.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cSo I propose to hang about the garden till the creature has cleared off,\u201d\n       went on the doctor, \u201cand then I\u2019ll go in to Quinton with the medicine.\n      Atkinson can\u2019t get in, because I locked the door.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIn that case, Dr. Harris,\u201d said Flambeau, \u201cwe might as well walk round at\n      the back by the end of the conservatory. There\u2019s no entrance to it that\n      way, but it\u2019s worth seeing, even from the outside.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes, and I might get a squint at my patient,\u201d laughed the doctor, \u201cfor he\n      prefers to lie on an ottoman right at the end of the conservatory amid all\n      those blood-red poinsettias; it would give me the creeps. But what are you\n      doing?\u201d\n     \n\n      Father Brown had stopped for a moment, and picked up out of the long\n      grass, where it had almost been wholly hidden, a queer, crooked Oriental\n      knife, inlaid exquisitely in coloured stones and metals.\n    \n\n      \u201cWhat is this?\u201d asked Father Brown, regarding it with some disfavour.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, Quinton\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d said Dr. Harris carelessly; \u201che has all sorts\n      of Chinese knickknacks about the place. Or perhaps it belongs to that mild\n      Hindoo of his whom he keeps on a string.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhat Hindoo?\u201d asked Father Brown, still staring at the dagger in his\n      hand.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, some Indian conjuror,\u201d said the doctor lightly; \u201ca fraud, of course.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in magic?\u201d asked Father Brown, without looking up.\n    \n\n      \u201cO crickey! magic!\u201d said the doctor.\n    \n\n      \u201cIt\u2019s very beautiful,\u201d said the priest in a low, dreaming voice; \u201cthe\n      colours are very beautiful. But it\u2019s the wrong shape.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhat for?\u201d asked Flambeau, staring.\n    \n\n      \u201cFor anything. It\u2019s the wrong shape in the abstract. Don\u2019t you ever feel\n      that about Eastern art? The colours are intoxicatingly lovely; but the\n      shapes are mean and bad\u2014deliberately mean and bad. I have seen\n      wicked things in a Turkey carpet.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cMon Dieu!\u201d cried Flambeau, laughing.\n    \n\n      \u201cThey are letters and symbols in a language I don\u2019t know; but I know they\n      stand for evil words,\u201d went on the priest, his voice growing lower and\n      lower. \u201cThe lines go wrong on purpose\u2014like serpents doubling to\n      escape.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhat the devil are you talking about?\u201d said the doctor with a loud laugh.\n    \n\n      Flambeau spoke quietly to him in answer. \u201cThe Father sometimes gets this\n      mystic\u2019s cloud on him,\u201d he said; \u201cbut I give you fair warning that I have\n      never known him to have it except when there was some evil quite near.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOh, rats!\u201d said the scientist.\n    \n\n      \u201cWhy, look at it,\u201d cried Father Brown, holding out the crooked knife at\n      arm\u2019s length, as if it were some glittering snake. \u201cDon\u2019t you see it is\n      the wrong shape? Don\u2019t you see that it has no hearty and plain purpose? It\n      does not point like a spear. It does not sweep like a scythe. It does not\n      look like a weapon. It looks like an instrument of torture.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, as you don\u2019t seem to like it,\u201d said the jolly Harris, \u201cit had\n      better be taken back to its owner. Haven\u2019t we come to the end of this\n      confounded conservatory yet? This house is the wrong shape, if you like.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Father Brown, shaking his head. \u201cThe shape of\n      this house is quaint\u2014it is even laughable. But there is nothing\n      wrong about it.\u201d\n     \n\n      As they spoke they came round the curve of glass that ended the\n      conservatory, an uninterrupted curve, for there was neither door nor\n      window by which to enter at that end. The glass, however, was clear, and\n      the sun still bright, though beginning to set; and they could see not only\n      the flamboyant blossoms inside, but the frail figure of the poet in a\n      brown velvet coat lying languidly on the sofa, having, apparently, fallen\n      half asleep over a book. He was a pale, slight man, with loose, chestnut\n      hair and a fringe of beard that was the paradox of his face, for the beard\n      made him look less manly. These traits were well known to all three of\n      them; but even had it not been so, it may be doubted whether they would\n      have looked at Quinton just then. Their eyes were riveted on another\n      object.\n    \n\n      Exactly in their path, immediately outside the round end of the glass\n      building, was standing a tall man, whose drapery fell to his feet in\n      faultless white, and whose bare, brown skull, face, and neck gleamed in\n      the setting sun like splendid bronze. He was looking through the glass at\n      the sleeper, and he was more motionless than a mountain.\n    \n\n      \u201cWho is that?\u201d cried Father Brown, stepping back with a hissing intake of\n      his breath.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, it is only that Hindoo humbug,\u201d growled Harris; \u201cbut I don\u2019t know\n      what the deuce he\u2019s doing here.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIt looks like hypnotism,\u201d said Flambeau, biting his black moustache.\n    \n\n      \u201cWhy are you unmedical fellows always talking bosh about hypnotism?\u201d cried\n      the doctor. \u201cIt looks a deal more like burglary.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, we will speak to it, at any rate,\u201d said Flambeau, who was always\n      for action. One long stride took him to the place where the Indian stood.\n      Bowing from his great height, which overtopped even the Oriental\u2019s, he\n      said with placid impudence:\n    \n\n      \u201cGood evening, sir. Do you want anything?\u201d\n     \n\n      Quite slowly, like a great ship turning into a harbour, the great yellow\n      face turned, and looked at last over its white shoulder. They were\n      startled to see that its yellow eyelids were quite sealed, as in sleep.\n      \u201cThank you,\u201d said the face in excellent English. \u201cI want nothing.\u201d Then,\n      half opening the lids, so as to show a slit of opalescent eyeball, he\n      repeated, \u201cI want nothing.\u201d Then he opened his eyes wide with a startling\n      stare, said, \u201cI want nothing,\u201d and went rustling away into the rapidly\n      darkening garden.\n    \n\n      \u201cThe Christian is more modest,\u201d muttered Father Brown; \u201che wants\n      something.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhat on earth was he doing?\u201d asked Flambeau, knitting his black brows and\n      lowering his voice.\n    \n\n      \u201cI should like to talk to you later,\u201d said Father Brown.\n    \n\n      The sunlight was still a reality, but it was the red light of evening, and\n      the bulk of the garden trees and bushes grew blacker and blacker against\n      it. They turned round the end of the conservatory, and walked in silence\n      down the other side to get round to the front door. As they went they\n      seemed to wake something, as one startles a bird, in the deeper corner\n      between the study and the main building; and again they saw the\n      white-robed fakir slide out of the shadow, and slip round towards the\n      front door. To their surprise, however, he had not been alone. They found\n      themselves abruptly pulled up and forced to banish their bewilderment by\n      the appearance of Mrs. Quinton, with her heavy golden hair and square pale\n      face, advancing on them out of the twilight. She looked a little stern,\n      but was entirely courteous.\n    \n\n      \u201cGood evening, Dr. Harris,\u201d was all she said.\n    \n\n      \u201cGood evening, Mrs. Quinton,\u201d said the little doctor heartily. \u201cI am just\n      going to give your husband his sleeping draught.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d she said in a clear voice. \u201cI think it is quite time.\u201d And she\n      smiled at them, and went sweeping into the house.\n    \n\n      \u201cThat woman\u2019s over-driven,\u201d said Father Brown; \u201cthat\u2019s the kind of woman\n      that does her duty for twenty years, and then does something dreadful.\u201d\n     \n\n      The little doctor looked at him for the first time with an eye of\n      interest. \u201cDid you ever study medicine?\u201d he asked.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou have to know something of the mind as well as the body,\u201d answered the\n      priest; \u201cwe have to know something of the body as well as the mind.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cI think I\u2019ll go and give Quinton his stuff.\u201d\n     \n\n      They had turned the corner of the front fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, and were approaching the\n      front doorway. As they turned into it they saw the man in the white robe\n      for the third time. He came so straight towards the front door that it\n      seemed quite incredible that he had not just come out of the study\n      opposite to it. Yet they knew that the study door was locked.\n    \n\n      Father Brown and Flambeau, however, kept this weird contradiction to\n      themselves, and Dr. Harris was not a man to waste his thoughts on the\n      impossible. He permitted the omnipresent Asiatic to make his exit, and\n      then stepped briskly into the hall. There he found a figure which he had\n      already forgotten. The inane Atkinson was still hanging about, humming and\n      poking things with his knobby cane. The doctor\u2019s face had a spasm of\n      disgust and decision, and he whispered rapidly to his companion: \u201cI must\n      lock the door again, or this rat will get in. But I shall be out again in\n      two minutes.\u201d\n     \n\n      He rapidly unlocked the door and locked it again behind him, just balking\n      a blundering charge from the young man in the billycock. The young man\n      threw himself impatiently on a hall chair. Flambeau looked at a Persian\n      illumination on the wall; Father Brown, who seemed in a sort of daze,\n      dully eyed the door. In about four minutes the door was opened again.\n      Atkinson was quicker this time. He sprang forward, held the door open for\n      an instant, and called out: \u201cOh, I say, Quinton, I want\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      From the other end of the study came the clear voice of Quinton, in\n      something between a yawn and a yell of weary laughter.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, I know what you want. Take it, and leave me in peace. I\u2019m writing a\n      song about peacocks.\u201d\n     \n\n      Before the door closed half a sovereign came flying through the aperture;\n      and Atkinson, stumbling forward, caught it with singular dexterity.\n    \n\n      \u201cSo that\u2019s settled,\u201d said the doctor, and, locking the door savagely, he\n      led the way out into the garden.\n    \n\n      \u201cPoor Leonard can get a little peace now,\u201d he added to Father Brown; \u201che\u2019s\n      locked in all by himself for an hour or two.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d answered the priest; \u201cand his voice sounded jolly enough when we\n      left him.\u201d Then he looked gravely round the garden, and saw the loose\n      figure of Atkinson standing and jingling the half-sovereign in his pocket,\n      and beyond, in the purple twilight, the figure of the Indian sitting bolt\n      upright upon a bank of grass with his face turned towards the setting sun.\n      Then he said abruptly: \u201cWhere is Mrs. Quinton!\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cShe has gone up to her room,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cThat is her shadow on the\n      blind.\u201d\n     \n\n      Father Brown looked up, and frowningly scrutinised a dark outline at the\n      gas-lit window.\n    \n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is her shadow,\u201d and he walked a yard or two and\n      threw himself upon a garden seat.\n    \n\n      Flambeau sat down beside him; but the doctor was one of those energetic\n      people who live naturally on their legs. He walked away, smoking, into the\n      twilight, and the two friends were left together.\n    \n\n      \u201cMy father,\u201d said Flambeau in French, \u201cwhat is the matter with you?\u201d\n     \n\n      Father Brown was silent and motionless for half a minute, then he said:\n      \u201cSuperstition is irreligious, but there is something in the air of this\n      place. I think it\u2019s that Indian\u2014at least, partly.\u201d\n     \n\n      He sank into silence, and watched the distant outline of the Indian, who\n      still sat rigid as if in prayer. At first sight he seemed motionless, but\n      as Father Brown watched him he saw that the man swayed ever so slightly\n      with a rhythmic movement, just as the dark tree-tops swayed ever so\n      slightly in the wind that was creeping up the dim garden paths and\n      shuffling the fallen leaves a little.\n    \n\n      The landscape was growing rapidly dark, as if for a storm, but they could\n      still see all the figures in their various places. Atkinson was leaning\n      against a tree with a listless face; Quinton\u2019s wife was still at her\n      window; the doctor had gone strolling round the end of the conservatory;\n      they could see his cigar like a will-o\u2019-the-wisp; and the fakir still sat\n      rigid and yet rocking, while the trees above him began to rock and almost\n      to roar. Storm was certainly coming.\n    \n\n      \u201cWhen that Indian spoke to us,\u201d went on Brown in a conversational\n      undertone, \u201cI had a sort of vision, a vision of him and all his universe.\n      Yet he only said the same thing three times. When first he said \u2018I want\n      nothing,\u2019 it meant only that he was impenetrable, that Asia does not give\n      itself away. Then he said again, \u2018I want nothing,\u2019 and I knew that he\n      meant that he was sufficient to himself, like a cosmos, that he needed no\n      God, neither admitted any sins. And when he said the third time, \u2018I want\n      nothing,\u2019 he said it with blazing eyes. And I knew that he meant literally\n      what he said; that nothing was his desire and his home; that he was weary\n      for nothing as for wine; that annihilation, the mere destruction of\n      everything or anything\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      Two drops of rain fell; and for some reason Flambeau started and looked\n      up, as if they had stung him. And the same instant the doctor down by the\n      end of the conservatory began running towards them, calling out something\n      as he ran.\n    \n\n      As he came among them like a bombshell the restless Atkinson happened to\n      be taking a turn nearer to the house front; and the doctor clutched him by\n      the collar in a convulsive grip. \u201cFoul play!\u201d he cried; \u201cwhat have you\n      been doing to him, you dog?\u201d\n     \n\n      The priest had sprung erect, and had the voice of steel of a soldier in\n      command.\n    \n\n      \u201cNo fighting,\u201d he cried coolly; \u201cwe are enough to hold anyone we want to.\n      What is the matter, doctor?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThings are not right with Quinton,\u201d said the doctor, quite white. \u201cI\n      could just see him through the glass, and I don\u2019t like the way he\u2019s lying.\n      It\u2019s not as I left him, anyhow.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cLet us go in to him,\u201d said Father Brown shortly. \u201cYou can leave Mr.\n      Atkinson alone. I have had him in sight since we heard Quinton\u2019s voice.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI will stop here and watch him,\u201d said Flambeau hurriedly. \u201cYou go in and\n      see.\u201d\n     \n\n      The doctor and the priest flew to the study door, unlocked it, and fell\n      into the room. In doing so they nearly fell over the large mahogany table\n      in the centre at which the poet usually wrote; for the place was lit only\n      by a small fire kept for the invalid. In the middle of this table lay a\n      single sheet of paper, evidently left there on purpose. The doctor\n      snatched it up, glanced at it, handed it to Father Brown, and crying,\n      \u201cGood God, look at that!\u201d plunged toward the glass room beyond, where the\n      terrible tropic flowers still seemed to keep a crimson memory of the\n      sunset.\n    \n\n      Father Brown read the words three times before he put down the paper. The\n      words were: \u201cI die by my own hand; yet I die murdered!\u201d They were in the\n      quite inimitable, not to say illegible, handwriting of Leonard Quinton.\n    \n\n      Then Father Brown, still keeping the paper in his hand, strode towards the\n      conservatory, only to meet his medical friend coming back with a face of\n      assurance and collapse. \u201cHe\u2019s done it,\u201d said Harris.\n    \n\n      They went together through the gorgeous unnatural beauty of cactus and\n      azalea and found Leonard Quinton, poet and romancer, with his head hanging\n      downward off his ottoman and his red curls sweeping the ground. Into his\n      left side was thrust the queer dagger that they had picked up in the\n      garden, and his limp hand still rested on the hilt.\n    \n\n      Outside the storm had come at one stride, like the night in Coleridge, and\n      garden and glass roof were darkened with driving rain. Father Brown seemed\n      to be studying the paper more than the corpse; he held it close to his\n      eyes; and seemed trying to read it in the twilight. Then he held it up\n      against the faint light, and, as he did so, lightning stared at them for\n      an instant so white that the paper looked black against it.\n    \n\n      Darkness full of thunder followed, and after the thunder Father Brown\u2019s\n      voice said out of the dark: \u201cDoctor, this paper is the wrong shape.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Doctor Harris, with a frowning stare.\n    \n\n      \u201cIt isn\u2019t square,\u201d answered Brown. \u201cIt has a sort of edge snipped off at\n      the corner. What does it mean?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHow the deuce should I know?\u201d growled the doctor. \u201cShall we move this\n      poor chap, do you think? He\u2019s quite dead.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNo,\u201d answered the priest; \u201cwe must leave him as he lies and send for the\n      police.\u201d But he was still scrutinising the paper.\n    \n\n      As they went back through the study he stopped by the table and picked up\n      a small pair of nail scissors. \u201cAh,\u201d he said, with a sort of relief, \u201cthis\n      is what he did it with. But yet\u2014\u201d And he knitted his brows.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, stop fooling with that scrap of paper,\u201d said the doctor emphatically.\n      \u201cIt was a fad of his. He had hundreds of them. He cut all his paper like\n      that,\u201d as he pointed to a stack of sermon paper still unused on another\n      and smaller table. Father Brown went up to it and held up a sheet. It was\n      the same irregular shape.\n    \n\n      \u201cQuite so,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd here I see the corners that were snipped off.\u201d\n       And to the indignation of his colleague he began to count them.\n    \n\n      \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, with an apologetic smile. \u201cTwenty-three\n      sheets cut and twenty-two corners cut off them. And as I see you are\n      impatient we will rejoin the others.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWho is to tell his wife?\u201d asked Dr. Harris. \u201cWill you go and tell her\n      now, while I send a servant for the police?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAs you will,\u201d said Father Brown indifferently. And he went out to the\n      hall door.\n    \n\n      Here also he found a drama, though of a more grotesque sort. It showed\n      nothing less than his big friend Flambeau in an attitude to which he had\n      long been unaccustomed, while upon the pathway at the bottom of the steps\n      was sprawling with his boots in the air the amiable Atkinson, his\n      billycock hat and walking cane sent flying in opposite directions along\n      the path. Atkinson had at length wearied of Flambeau\u2019s almost paternal\n      custody, and had endeavoured to knock him down, which was by no means a\n      smooth game to play with the Roi des Apaches, even after that monarch\u2019s\n      abdication.\n    \n\n      Flambeau was about to leap upon his enemy and secure him once more, when\n      the priest patted him easily on the shoulder.\n    \n\n      \u201cMake it up with Mr. Atkinson, my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cBeg a mutual pardon\n      and say \u2018Good night.\u2019 We need not detain him any longer.\u201d Then, as\n      Atkinson rose somewhat doubtfully and gathered his hat and stick and went\n      towards the garden gate, Father Brown said in a more serious voice: \u201cWhere\n      is that Indian?\u201d\n     \n\n      They all three (for the doctor had joined them) turned involuntarily\n      towards the dim grassy bank amid the tossing trees purple with twilight,\n      where they had last seen the brown man swaying in his strange prayers. The\n      Indian was gone.\n    \n\n      \u201cConfound him,\u201d cried the doctor, stamping furiously. \u201cNow I know that it\n      was that nigger that did it.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said Father Brown quietly.\n    \n\n      \u201cNo more I did,\u201d said the doctor, rolling his eyes. \u201cI only know that I\n      loathed that yellow devil when I thought he was a sham wizard. And I shall\n      loathe him more if I come to think he was a real one.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, his having escaped is nothing,\u201d said Flambeau. \u201cFor we could have\n      proved nothing and done nothing against him. One hardly goes to the parish\n      constable with a story of suicide imposed by witchcraft or\n      auto-suggestion.\u201d\n     \n\n      Meanwhile Father Brown had made his way into the house, and now went to\n      break the news to the wife of the dead man.\n    \n\n      When he came out again he looked a little pale and tragic, but what passed\n      between them in that interview was never known, even when all was known.\n    \n\n      Flambeau, who was talking quietly with the doctor, was surprised to see\n      his friend reappear so soon at his elbow; but Brown took no notice, and\n      merely drew the doctor apart. \u201cYou have sent for the police, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n       he asked.\n    \n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d answered Harris. \u201cThey ought to be here in ten minutes.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWill you do me a favour?\u201d said the priest quietly. \u201cThe truth is, I make\n      a collection of these curious stories, which often contain, as in the case\n      of our Hindoo friend, elements which can hardly be put into a police\n      report. Now, I want you to write out a report of this case for my private\n      use. Yours is a clever trade,\u201d he said, looking the doctor gravely and\n      steadily in the face. \u201cI sometimes think that you know some details of\n      this matter which you have not thought fit to mention. Mine is a\n      confidential trade like yours, and I will treat anything you write for me\n      in strict confidence. But write the whole.\u201d\n     \n\n      The doctor, who had been listening thoughtfully with his head a little on\n      one side, looked the priest in the face for an instant, and said: \u201cAll\n      right,\u201d and went into the study, closing the door behind him.\n    \n\n      \u201cFlambeau,\u201d said Father Brown, \u201cthere is a long seat there under the\n      veranda, where we can smoke out of the rain. You are my only friend in the\n      world, and I want to talk to you. Or, perhaps, be silent with you.\u201d\n     \n\n      They established themselves comfortably in the veranda seat; Father Brown,\n      against his common habit, accepted a good cigar and smoked it steadily in\n      silence, while the rain shrieked and rattled on the roof of the veranda.\n    \n\n      \u201cMy friend,\u201d he said at length, \u201cthis is a very queer case. A very queer\n      case.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI should think it was,\u201d said Flambeau, with something like a shudder.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou call it queer, and I call it queer,\u201d said the other, \u201cand yet we mean\n      quite opposite things. The modern mind always mixes up two different\n      ideas: mystery in the sense of what is marvellous, and mystery in the\n      sense of what is complicated. That is half its difficulty about miracles.\n      A miracle is startling; but it is simple. It is simple because it is a\n      miracle. It is power coming directly from God (or the devil) instead of\n      indirectly through nature or human wills. Now, you mean that this business\n      is marvellous because it is miraculous, because it is witchcraft worked by\n      a wicked Indian. Understand, I do not say that it was not spiritual or\n      diabolic. Heaven and hell only know by what surrounding influences strange\n      sins come into the lives of men. But for the present my point is this: If\n      it was pure magic, as you think, then it is marvellous; but it is not\n      mysterious\u2014that is, it is not complicated. The quality of a miracle\n      is mysterious, but its manner is simple. Now, the manner of this business\n      has been the reverse of simple.\u201d\n     \n\n      The storm that had slackened for a little seemed to be swelling again, and\n      there came heavy movements as of faint thunder. Father Brown let fall the\n      ash of his cigar and went on:\n    \n\n      \u201cThere has been in this incident,\u201d he said, \u201ca twisted, ugly, complex\n      quality that does not belong to the straight bolts either of heaven or\n      hell. As one knows the crooked track of a snail, I know the crooked track\n      of a man.\u201d\n     \n\n      The white lightning opened its enormous eye in one wink, the sky shut up\n      again, and the priest went on:\n    \n\n      \u201cOf all these crooked things, the crookedest was the shape of that piece\n      of paper. It was crookeder than the dagger that killed him.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYou mean the paper on which Quinton confessed his suicide,\u201d said\n      Flambeau.\n    \n\n      \u201cI mean the paper on which Quinton wrote, \u2018I die by my own hand,\u2019\u201d\n       answered Father Brown. \u201cThe shape of that paper, my friend, was the wrong\n      shape; the wrong shape, if ever I have seen it in this wicked world.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIt only had a corner snipped off,\u201d said Flambeau, \u201cand I understand that\n      all Quinton\u2019s paper was cut that way.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIt was a very odd way,\u201d said the other, \u201cand a very bad way, to my taste\n      and fancy. Look here, Flambeau, this Quinton\u2014God receive his soul!\u2014was\n      perhaps a bit of a cur in some ways, but he really was an artist, with the\n      pencil as well as the pen. His handwriting, though hard to read, was bold\n      and beautiful. I can\u2019t prove what I say; I can\u2019t prove anything. But I\n      tell you with the full force of conviction that he could never have cut\n      that mean little piece off a sheet of paper. If he had wanted to cut down\n      paper for some purpose of fitting in, or binding up, or what not, he would\n      have made quite a different slash with the scissors. Do you remember the\n      shape? It was a mean shape. It was a wrong shape. Like this. Don\u2019t you\n      remember?\u201d\n     \n\n      And he waved his burning cigar before him in the darkness, making\n      irregular squares so rapidly that Flambeau really seemed to see them as\n      fiery hieroglyphics upon the darkness\u2014hieroglyphics such as his\n      friend had spoken of, which are undecipherable, yet can have no good\n      meaning.\n    \n\n      \u201cBut,\u201d said Flambeau, as the priest put his cigar in his mouth again and\n      leaned back, staring at the roof, \u201csuppose somebody else did use the\n      scissors. Why should somebody else, cutting pieces off his sermon paper,\n      make Quinton commit suicide?\u201d\n     \n\n      Father Brown was still leaning back and staring at the roof, but he took\n      his cigar out of his mouth and said: \u201cQuinton never did commit suicide.\u201d\n     \n\n      Flambeau stared at him. \u201cWhy, confound it all,\u201d he cried, \u201cthen why did he\n      confess to suicide?\u201d\n     \n\n      The priest leant forward again, settled his elbows on his knees, looked at\n      the ground, and said, in a low, distinct voice: \u201cHe never did confess to\n      suicide.\u201d\n     \n\n      Flambeau laid his cigar down. \u201cYou mean,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the writing was\n      forged?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said Father Brown. \u201cQuinton wrote it all right.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, there you are,\u201d said the aggravated Flambeau; \u201cQuinton wrote, \u2018I\n      die by my own hand,\u2019 with his own hand on a plain piece of paper.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOf the wrong shape,\u201d said the priest calmly.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, the shape be damned!\u201d cried Flambeau. \u201cWhat has the shape to do with\n      it?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThere were twenty-three snipped papers,\u201d resumed Brown unmoved, \u201cand only\n      twenty-two pieces snipped off. Therefore one of the pieces had been\n      destroyed, probably that from the written paper. Does that suggest\n      anything to you?\u201d\n     \n\n      A light dawned on Flambeau\u2019s face, and he said: \u201cThere was something else\n      written by Quinton, some other words. \u2018They will tell you I die by my own\n      hand,\u2019 or \u2018Do not believe that\u2014\u2018\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHotter, as the children say,\u201d said his friend. \u201cBut the piece was hardly\n      half an inch across; there was no room for one word, let alone five. Can\n      you think of anything hardly bigger than a comma which the man with hell\n      in his heart had to tear away as a testimony against him?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI can think of nothing,\u201d said Flambeau at last.\n    \n\n      \u201cWhat about quotation marks?\u201d said the priest, and flung his cigar far\n      into the darkness like a shooting star.\n    \n\n      All words had left the other man\u2019s mouth, and Father Brown said, like one\n      going back to fundamentals:\n    \n\n      \u201cLeonard Quinton was a romancer, and was writing an Oriental romance about\n      wizardry and hypnotism. He\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      At this moment the door opened briskly behind them, and the doctor came\n      out with his hat on. He put a long envelope into the priest\u2019s hands.\n    \n\n      \u201cThat\u2019s the document you wanted,\u201d he said, \u201cand I must be getting home.\n      Good night.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cGood night,\u201d said Father Brown, as the doctor walked briskly to the gate.\n      He had left the front door open, so that a shaft of gaslight fell upon\n      them. In the light of this Brown opened the envelope and read the\n      following words:\n    \n\n    DEAR FATHER BROWN,\u2014Vicisti Galilee. Otherwise, damn your\n    eyes, which are very penetrating ones. Can it be possible that\n    there is something in all that stuff of yours after all?\n\n\n    I am a man who has ever since boyhood believed in Nature and\n    in all natural functions and instincts, whether men called them\n    moral or immoral. Long before I became a doctor, when I was a\n    schoolboy keeping mice and spiders, I believed that to be a good\n    animal is the best thing in the world. But just now I am shaken;\n    I have believed in Nature; but it seems as if Nature could betray\n    a man. Can there be anything in your bosh? I am really getting\n    morbid.\n\n\n    I loved Quinton\u2019s wife. What was there wrong in that? Nature\n    told me to, and it\u2019s love that makes the world go round. I also\n    thought quite sincerely that she would be happier with a clean\n    animal like me than with that tormenting little lunatic. What was\n    there wrong in that? I was only facing facts, like a man of\n    science. She would have been happier.\n\n\n    According to my own creed I was quite free to kill Quinton,\n    which was the best thing for everybody, even himself. But as a\n    healthy animal I had no notion of killing myself. I resolved,\n    therefore, that I would never do it until I saw a chance that\n    would leave me scot free. I saw that chance this morning.\n\n\n    I have been three times, all told, into Quinton\u2019s study today.\n    The first time I went in he would talk about nothing but the weird\n    tale, called \u201cThe Cure of a Saint,\u201d which he was writing, which\n    was all about how some Indian hermit made an English colonel kill\n    himself by thinking about him. He showed me the last sheets, and\n    even read me the last paragraph, which was something like this:\n    \u201cThe conqueror of the Punjab, a mere yellow skeleton, but still\n    gigantic, managed to lift himself on his elbow and gasp in his\n    nephew\u2019s ear: \u2018I die by my own hand, yet I die murdered!\u2019\u201d It so\n    happened by one chance out of a hundred, that those last words\n    were written at the top of a new sheet of paper. I left the room,\n    and went out into the garden intoxicated with a frightful\n    opportunity.\n\n\n    We walked round the house; and two more things happened in my\n    favour. You suspected an Indian, and you found a dagger which the\n    Indian might most probably use. Taking the opportunity to stuff\n    it in my pocket I went back to Quinton\u2019s study, locked the door,\n    and gave him his sleeping draught. He was against answering\n    Atkinson at all, but I urged him to call out and quiet the fellow,\n    because I wanted a clear proof that Quinton was alive when I left\n    the room for the second time. Quinton lay down in the conservatory,\n    and I came through the study. I am a quick man with my hands, and\n    in a minute and a half I had done what I wanted to do. I had\n    emptied all the first part of Quinton\u2019s romance into the fireplace,\n    where it burnt to ashes. Then I saw that the quotation marks\n    wouldn\u2019t do, so I snipped them off, and to make it seem likelier,\n    snipped the whole quire to match. Then I came out with the\n    knowledge that Quinton\u2019s confession of suicide lay on the front\n    table, while Quinton lay alive but asleep in the conservatory\n    beyond.\n\n\n    The last act was a desperate one; you can guess it: I pretended\n    to have seen Quinton dead and rushed to his room. I delayed you\n    with the paper, and, being a quick man with my hands, killed\n    Quinton while you were looking at his confession of suicide. He\n    was half-asleep, being drugged, and I put his own hand on the\n    knife and drove it into his body. The knife was of so queer a\n    shape that no one but an operator could have calculated the angle\n    that would reach his heart. I wonder if you noticed this.\n\n\n    When I had done it, the extraordinary thing happened. Nature\n    deserted me. I felt ill. I felt just as if I had done something\n    wrong. I think my brain is breaking up; I feel some sort of\n    desperate pleasure in thinking I have told the thing to somebody;\n    that I shall not have to be alone with it if I marry and have\n    children. What is the matter with me?... Madness... or can one\n    have remorse, just as if one were in Byron\u2019s poems! I cannot\n    write any more.\n\n                   James Erskine Harris.\n\n\n      Father Brown carefully folded up the letter, and put it in his breast\n      pocket just as there came a loud peal at the gate bell, and the wet\n      waterproofs of several policemen gleamed in the road outside.\n    ",
