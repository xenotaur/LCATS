    "body": "\n      \u201cThe most beautiful crime I ever committed,\u201d Flambeau would say in his\n      highly moral old age, \u201cwas also, by a singular coincidence, my last. It\n      was committed at Christmas. As an artist I had always attempted to provide\n      crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which I found\n      myself, choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe, as if\n      for a statuary group. Thus squires should be swindled in long rooms\n      panelled with oak; while Jews, on the other hand, should rather find\n      themselves unexpectedly penniless among the lights and screens of the Caf\u00c3\u00a9\n      Riche. Thus, in England, if I wished to relieve a dean of his riches\n      (which is not so easy as you might suppose), I wished to frame him, if I\n      make myself clear, in the green lawns and grey towers of some cathedral\n      town. Similarly, in France, when I had got money out of a rich and wicked\n      peasant (which is almost impossible), it gratified me to get his indignant\n      head relieved against a grey line of clipped poplars, and those solemn\n      plains of Gaul over which broods the mighty spirit of Millet.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell, my last crime was a Christmas crime, a cheery, cosy, English\n      middle-class crime; a crime of Charles Dickens. I did it in a good old\n      middle-class house near Putney, a house with a crescent of carriage drive,\n      a house with a stable by the side of it, a house with the name on the two\n      outer gates, a house with a monkey tree. Enough, you know the species. I\n      really think my imitation of Dickens\u2019s style was dexterous and literary.\n      It seems almost a pity I repented the same evening.\u201d\n     \n\n      Flambeau would then proceed to tell the story from the inside; and even\n      from the inside it was odd. Seen from the outside it was perfectly\n      incomprehensible, and it is from the outside that the stranger must study\n      it. From this standpoint the drama may be said to have begun when the\n      front doors of the house with the stable opened on the garden with the\n      monkey tree, and a young girl came out with bread to feed the birds on the\n      afternoon of Boxing Day. She had a pretty face, with brave brown eyes; but\n      her figure was beyond conjecture, for she was so wrapped up in brown furs\n      that it was hard to say which was hair and which was fur. But for the\n      attractive face she might have been a small toddling bear.\n    \n\n      The winter afternoon was reddening towards evening, and already a ruby\n      light was rolled over the bloomless beds, filling them, as it were, with\n      the ghosts of the dead roses. On one side of the house stood the stable,\n      on the other an alley or cloister of laurels led to the larger garden\n      behind. The young lady, having scattered bread for the birds (for the\n      fourth or fifth time that day, because the dog ate it), passed\n      unobtrusively down the lane of laurels and into a glimmering plantation of\n      evergreens behind. Here she gave an exclamation of wonder, real or ritual,\n      and looking up at the high garden wall above her, beheld it fantastically\n      bestridden by a somewhat fantastic figure.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, don\u2019t jump, Mr. Crook,\u201d she called out in some alarm; \u201cit\u2019s much too\n      high.\u201d\n     \n\n      The individual riding the party wall like an aerial horse was a tall,\n      angular young man, with dark hair sticking up like a hair brush,\n      intelligent and even distinguished lineaments, but a sallow and almost\n      alien complexion. This showed the more plainly because he wore an\n      aggressive red tie, the only part of his costume of which he seemed to\n      take any care. Perhaps it was a symbol. He took no notice of the girl\u2019s\n      alarmed adjuration, but leapt like a grasshopper to the ground beside her,\n      where he might very well have broken his legs.\n    \n\n      \u201cI think I was meant to be a burglar,\u201d he said placidly, \u201cand I have no\n      doubt I should have been if I hadn\u2019t happened to be born in that nice\n      house next door. I can\u2019t see any harm in it, anyhow.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHow can you say such things!\u201d she remonstrated.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell,\u201d said the young man, \u201cif you\u2019re born on the wrong side of the wall,\n      I can\u2019t see that it\u2019s wrong to climb over it.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI never know what you will say or do next,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n      \u201cI don\u2019t often know myself,\u201d replied Mr. Crook; \u201cbut then I am on the\n      right side of the wall now.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAnd which is the right side of the wall?\u201d asked the young lady, smiling.\n    \n\n      \u201cWhichever side you are on,\u201d said the young man named Crook.\n    \n\n      As they went together through the laurels towards the front garden a motor\n      horn sounded thrice, coming nearer and nearer, and a car of splendid\n      speed, great elegance, and a pale green colour swept up to the front doors\n      like a bird and stood throbbing.\n    \n\n      \u201cHullo, hullo!\u201d said the young man with the red tie, \u201chere\u2019s somebody born\n      on the right side, anyhow. I didn\u2019t know, Miss Adams, that your Santa\n      Claus was so modern as this.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOh, that\u2019s my godfather, Sir Leopold Fischer. He always comes on Boxing\n      Day.\u201d\n     \n\n      Then, after an innocent pause, which unconsciously betrayed some lack of\n      enthusiasm, Ruby Adams added:\n    \n\n      \u201cHe is very kind.\u201d\n     \n\n      John Crook, journalist, had heard of that eminent City magnate; and it\n      was not his fault if the City magnate had not heard of him; for in\n      certain articles in The Clarion or The New Age Sir Leopold\n      had been dealt with austerely. But he said nothing and grimly watched the\n      unloading of the motor-car, which was rather a long process. A large,\n      neat chauffeur in green got out from the front, and a small, neat\n      manservant in grey got out from the back, and between them they deposited\n      Sir Leopold on the doorstep and began to unpack him, like some very\n      carefully protected parcel. Rugs enough to stock a bazaar, furs of all\n      the beasts of the forest, and scarves of all the colours of the rainbow\n      were unwrapped one by one, till they revealed something resembling the\n      human form; the form of a friendly, but foreign-looking old gentleman,\n      with a grey goat-like beard and a beaming smile, who rubbed his big fur\n      gloves together.\n    \n\n      Long before this revelation was complete the two big doors of the porch\n      had opened in the middle, and Colonel Adams (father of the furry young\n      lady) had come out himself to invite his eminent guest inside. He was a\n      tall, sunburnt, and very silent man, who wore a red smoking-cap like a\n      fez, making him look like one of the English Sirdars or Pashas in Egypt.\n      With him was his brother-in-law, lately come from Canada, a big and rather\n      boisterous young gentleman-farmer, with a yellow beard, by name James\n      Blount. With him also was the more insignificant figure of the priest from\n      the neighbouring Roman Church; for the colonel\u2019s late wife had been a\n      Catholic, and the children, as is common in such cases, had been trained\n      to follow her. Everything seemed undistinguished about the priest, even\n      down to his name, which was Brown; yet the colonel had always found\n      something companionable about him, and frequently asked him to such family\n      gatherings.\n    \n\n      In the large entrance hall of the house there was ample room even for Sir\n      Leopold and the removal of his wraps. Porch and vestibule, indeed, were\n      unduly large in proportion to the house, and formed, as it were, a big\n      room with the front door at one end, and the bottom of the staircase at\n      the other. In front of the large hall fire, over which hung the colonel\u2019s\n      sword, the process was completed and the company, including the saturnine\n      Crook, presented to Sir Leopold Fischer. That venerable financier,\n      however, still seemed struggling with portions of his well-lined attire,\n      and at length produced from a very interior tail-coat pocket, a black oval\n      case which he radiantly explained to be his Christmas present for his\n      god-daughter. With an unaffected vain-glory that had something disarming\n      about it he held out the case before them all; it flew open at a touch and\n      half-blinded them. It was just as if a crystal fountain had spurted in\n      their eyes. In a nest of orange velvet lay like three eggs, three white\n      and vivid diamonds that seemed to set the very air on fire all round them.\n      Fischer stood beaming benevolently and drinking deep of the astonishment\n      and ecstasy of the girl, the grim admiration and gruff thanks of the\n      colonel, the wonder of the whole group.\n    \n\n      \u201cI\u2019ll put \u2019em back now, my dear,\u201d said Fischer, returning the case to the\n      tails of his coat. \u201cI had to be careful of \u2019em coming down. They\u2019re the\n      three great African diamonds called \u2018The Flying Stars,\u2019 because they\u2019ve\n      been stolen so often. All the big criminals are on the track; but even the\n      rough men about in the streets and hotels could hardly have kept their\n      hands off them. I might have lost them on the road here. It was quite\n      possible.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cQuite natural, I should say,\u201d growled the man in the red tie. \u201cI\n      shouldn\u2019t blame \u2019em if they had taken \u2019em. When they ask for bread, and\n      you don\u2019t even give them a stone, I think they might take the stone for\n      themselves.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI won\u2019t have you talking like that,\u201d cried the girl, who was in a curious\n      glow. \u201cYou\u2019ve only talked like that since you became a horrid\n      what\u2019s-his-name. You know what I mean. What do you call a man who wants to\n      embrace the chimney-sweep?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cA saint,\u201d said Father Brown.\n    \n\n      \u201cI think,\u201d said Sir Leopold, with a supercilious smile, \u201cthat Ruby means a\n      Socialist.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cA radical does not mean a man who lives on radishes,\u201d remarked Crook,\n      with some impatience; \u201cand a Conservative does not mean a man who\n      preserves jam. Neither, I assure you, does a Socialist mean a man who\n      desires a social evening with the chimney-sweep. A Socialist means a man\n      who wants all the chimneys swept and all the chimney-sweeps paid for it.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cBut who won\u2019t allow you,\u201d put in the priest in a low voice, \u201cto own your\n      own soot.\u201d\n     \n\n      Crook looked at him with an eye of interest and even respect. \u201cDoes one\n      want to own soot?\u201d he asked.\n    \n\n      \u201cOne might,\u201d answered Brown, with speculation in his eye. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that\n      gardeners use it. And I once made six children happy at Christmas when the\n      conjuror didn\u2019t come, entirely with soot\u2014applied externally.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOh, splendid,\u201d cried Ruby. \u201cOh, I wish you\u2019d do it to this company.\u201d\n     \n\n      The boisterous Canadian, Mr. Blount, was lifting his loud voice in\n      applause, and the astonished financier his (in some considerable\n      deprecation), when a knock sounded at the double front doors. The priest\n      opened them, and they showed again the front garden of evergreens,\n      monkey-tree and all, now gathering gloom against a gorgeous violet sunset.\n      The scene thus framed was so coloured and quaint, like a back scene in a\n      play, that they forgot a moment the insignificant figure standing in the\n      door. He was dusty-looking and in a frayed coat, evidently a common\n      messenger. \u201cAny of you gentlemen Mr. Blount?\u201d he asked, and held forward a\n      letter doubtfully. Mr. Blount started, and stopped in his shout of assent.\n      Ripping up the envelope with evident astonishment he read it; his face\n      clouded a little, and then cleared, and he turned to his brother-in-law\n      and host.\n    \n\n      \u201cI\u2019m sick at being such a nuisance, colonel,\u201d he said, with the cheery\n      colonial conventions; \u201cbut would it upset you if an old acquaintance\n      called on me here tonight on business? In point of fact it\u2019s Florian, that\n      famous French acrobat and comic actor; I knew him years ago out West (he\n      was a French-Canadian by birth), and he seems to have business for me,\n      though I hardly guess what.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOf course, of course,\u201d replied the colonel carelessly\u2014\u201cMy dear\n      chap, any friend of yours. No doubt he will prove an acquisition.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHe\u2019ll black his face, if that\u2019s what you mean,\u201d cried Blount, laughing.\n      \u201cI don\u2019t doubt he\u2019d black everyone else\u2019s eyes. I don\u2019t care; I\u2019m not\n      refined. I like the jolly old pantomime where a man sits on his top hat.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNot on mine, please,\u201d said Sir Leopold Fischer, with dignity.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell, well,\u201d observed Crook, airily, \u201cdon\u2019t let\u2019s quarrel. There are\n      lower jokes than sitting on a top hat.\u201d\n     \n\n      Dislike of the red-tied youth, born of his predatory opinions and evident\n      intimacy with the pretty godchild, led Fischer to say, in his most\n      sarcastic, magisterial manner: \u201cNo doubt you have found something much\n      lower than sitting on a top hat. What is it, pray?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cLetting a top hat sit on you, for instance,\u201d said the Socialist.\n    \n\n      \u201cNow, now, now,\u201d cried the Canadian farmer with his barbarian benevolence,\n      \u201cdon\u2019t let\u2019s spoil a jolly evening. What I say is, let\u2019s do something for\n      the company tonight. Not blacking faces or sitting on hats, if you don\u2019t\n      like those\u2014but something of the sort. Why couldn\u2019t we have a proper\n      old English pantomime\u2014clown, columbine, and so on. I saw one when I\n      left England at twelve years old, and it\u2019s blazed in my brain like a\n      bonfire ever since. I came back to the old country only last year, and I\n      find the thing\u2019s extinct. Nothing but a lot of snivelling fairy plays. I\n      want a hot poker and a policeman made into sausages, and they give me\n      princesses moralising by moonlight, Blue Birds, or something. Blue Beard\u2019s\n      more in my line, and him I like best when he turned into the pantaloon.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI\u2019m all for making a policeman into sausages,\u201d said John Crook. \u201cIt\u2019s a\n      better definition of Socialism than some recently given. But surely the\n      get-up would be too big a business.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNot a scrap,\u201d cried Blount, quite carried away. \u201cA harlequinade\u2019s the\n      quickest thing we can do, for two reasons. First, one can gag to any\n      degree; and, second, all the objects are household things\u2014tables and\n      towel-horses and washing baskets, and things like that.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d admitted Crook, nodding eagerly and walking about. \u201cBut I\u2019m\n      afraid I can\u2019t have my policeman\u2019s uniform? Haven\u2019t killed a policeman\n      lately.\u201d\n     \n\n      Blount frowned thoughtfully a space, and then smote his thigh. \u201cYes, we\n      can!\u201d he cried. \u201cI\u2019ve got Florian\u2019s address here, and he knows every\n      costumier in London. I\u2019ll phone him to bring a police dress when he\n      comes.\u201d And he went bounding away to the telephone.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, it\u2019s glorious, godfather,\u201d cried Ruby, almost dancing. \u201cI\u2019ll be\n      columbine and you shall be pantaloon.\u201d\n     \n\n      The millionaire held himself stiff with a sort of heathen solemnity. \u201cI\n      think, my dear,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must get someone else for pantaloon.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI will be pantaloon, if you like,\u201d said Colonel Adams, taking his cigar\n      out of his mouth, and speaking for the first and last time.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou ought to have a statue,\u201d cried the Canadian, as he came back,\n      radiant, from the telephone. \u201cThere, we are all fitted. Mr. Crook shall be\n      clown; he\u2019s a journalist and knows all the oldest jokes. I can be\n      harlequin, that only wants long legs and jumping about. My friend Florian\n      \u2019phones he\u2019s bringing the police costume; he\u2019s changing on the way. We can\n      act it in this very hall, the audience sitting on those broad stairs\n      opposite, one row above another. These front doors can be the back scene,\n      either open or shut. Shut, you see an English interior. Open, a moonlit\n      garden. It all goes by magic.\u201d And snatching a chance piece of billiard\n      chalk from his pocket, he ran it across the hall floor, half-way between\n      the front door and the staircase, to mark the line of the footlights.\n    \n\n      How even such a banquet of bosh was got ready in the time remained a\n      riddle. But they went at it with that mixture of recklessness and industry\n      that lives when youth is in a house; and youth was in that house that\n      night, though not all may have isolated the two faces and hearts from\n      which it flamed. As always happens, the invention grew wilder and wilder\n      through the very tameness of the bourgeois conventions from which it had\n      to create. The columbine looked charming in an outstanding skirt that\n      strangely resembled the large lamp-shade in the drawing-room. The clown\n      and pantaloon made themselves white with flour from the cook, and red with\n      rouge from some other domestic, who remained (like all true Christian\n      benefactors) anonymous. The harlequin, already clad in silver paper out of\n      cigar boxes, was, with difficulty, prevented from smashing the old\n      Victorian lustre chandeliers, that he might cover himself with resplendent\n      crystals. In fact he would certainly have done so, had not Ruby unearthed\n      some old pantomime paste jewels she had worn at a fancy dress party as the\n      Queen of Diamonds. Indeed, her uncle, James Blount, was getting almost out\n      of hand in his excitement; he was like a schoolboy. He put a paper\n      donkey\u2019s head unexpectedly on Father Brown, who bore it patiently, and\n      even found some private manner of moving his ears. He even essayed to put\n      the paper donkey\u2019s tail to the coat-tails of Sir Leopold Fischer. This,\n      however, was frowned down. \u201cUncle is too absurd,\u201d cried Ruby to Crook,\n      round whose shoulders she had seriously placed a string of sausages. \u201cWhy\n      is he so wild?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHe is harlequin to your columbine,\u201d said Crook. \u201cI am only the clown who\n      makes the old jokes.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI wish you were the harlequin,\u201d she said, and left the string of sausages\n      swinging.\n    \n\n      Father Brown, though he knew every detail done behind the scenes, and had\n      even evoked applause by his transformation of a pillow into a pantomime\n      baby, went round to the front and sat among the audience with all the\n      solemn expectation of a child at his first matinee. The spectators were\n      few, relations, one or two local friends, and the servants; Sir Leopold\n      sat in the front seat, his full and still fur-collared figure largely\n      obscuring the view of the little cleric behind him; but it has never been\n      settled by artistic authorities whether the cleric lost much. The\n      pantomime was utterly chaotic, yet not contemptible; there ran through it\n      a rage of improvisation which came chiefly from Crook the clown. Commonly\n      he was a clever man, and he was inspired tonight with a wild omniscience,\n      a folly wiser than the world, that which comes to a young man who has seen\n      for an instant a particular expression on a particular face. He was\n      supposed to be the clown, but he was really almost everything else, the\n      author (so far as there was an author), the prompter, the scene-painter,\n      the scene-shifter, and, above all, the orchestra. At abrupt intervals in\n      the outrageous performance he would hurl himself in full costume at the\n      piano and bang out some popular music equally absurd and appropriate.\n    \n\n      The climax of this, as of all else, was the moment when the two front\n      doors at the back of the scene flew open, showing the lovely moonlit\n      garden, but showing more prominently the famous professional guest; the\n      great Florian, dressed up as a policeman. The clown at the piano played\n      the constabulary chorus in the \u201cPirates of Penzance,\u201d but it was drowned\n      in the deafening applause, for every gesture of the great comic actor was\n      an admirable though restrained version of the carriage and manner of the\n      police. The harlequin leapt upon him and hit him over the helmet; the\n      pianist playing \u201cWhere did you get that hat?\u201d he faced about in admirably\n      simulated astonishment, and then the leaping harlequin hit him again (the\n      pianist suggesting a few bars of \u201cThen we had another one\u201d). Then the\n      harlequin rushed right into the arms of the policeman and fell on top of\n      him, amid a roar of applause. Then it was that the strange actor gave that\n      celebrated imitation of a dead man, of which the fame still lingers round\n      Putney. It was almost impossible to believe that a living person could\n      appear so limp.\n    \n\n      The athletic harlequin swung him about like a sack or twisted or tossed\n      him like an Indian club; all the time to the most maddeningly ludicrous\n      tunes from the piano. When the harlequin heaved the comic constable\n      heavily off the floor the clown played \u201cI arise from dreams of thee.\u201d When\n      he shuffled him across his back, \u201cWith my bundle on my shoulder,\u201d and when\n      the harlequin finally let fall the policeman with a most convincing thud,\n      the lunatic at the instrument struck into a jingling measure with some\n      words which are still believed to have been, \u201cI sent a letter to my love\n      and on the way I dropped it.\u201d\n     \n\n      At about this limit of mental anarchy Father Brown\u2019s view was obscured\n      altogether; for the City magnate in front of him rose to his full height\n      and thrust his hands savagely into all his pockets. Then he sat down\n      nervously, still fumbling, and then stood up again. For an instant it\n      seemed seriously likely that he would stride across the footlights; then\n      he turned a glare at the clown playing the piano; and then he burst in\n      silence out of the room.\n    \n\n      The priest had only watched for a few more minutes the absurd but not\n      inelegant dance of the amateur harlequin over his splendidly unconscious\n      foe. With real though rude art, the harlequin danced slowly backwards out\n      of the door into the garden, which was full of moonlight and stillness.\n      The vamped dress of silver paper and paste, which had been too glaring in\n      the footlights, looked more and more magical and silvery as it danced away\n      under a brilliant moon. The audience was closing in with a cataract of\n      applause, when Brown felt his arm abruptly touched, and he was asked in a\n      whisper to come into the colonel\u2019s study.\n    \n\n      He followed his summoner with increasing doubt, which was not dispelled by\n      a solemn comicality in the scene of the study. There sat Colonel Adams,\n      still unaffectedly dressed as a pantaloon, with the knobbed whalebone\n      nodding above his brow, but with his poor old eyes sad enough to have\n      sobered a Saturnalia. Sir Leopold Fischer was leaning against the\n      mantelpiece and heaving with all the importance of panic.\n    \n\n      \u201cThis is a very painful matter, Father Brown,\u201d said Adams. \u201cThe truth is,\n      those diamonds we all saw this afternoon seem to have vanished from my\n      friend\u2019s tail-coat pocket. And as you\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAs I,\u201d supplemented Father Brown, with a broad grin, \u201cwas sitting just\n      behind him\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNothing of the sort shall be suggested,\u201d said Colonel Adams, with a firm\n      look at Fischer, which rather implied that some such thing had been\n      suggested. \u201cI only ask you to give me the assistance that any gentleman\n      might give.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhich is turning out his pockets,\u201d said Father Brown, and proceeded to do\n      so, displaying seven and sixpence, a return ticket, a small silver\n      crucifix, a small breviary, and a stick of chocolate.\n    \n\n      The colonel looked at him long, and then said, \u201cDo you know, I should like\n      to see the inside of your head more than the inside of your pockets. My\n      daughter is one of your people, I know; well, she has lately\u2014\u201d and\n      he stopped.\n    \n\n      \u201cShe has lately,\u201d cried out old Fischer, \u201copened her father\u2019s house to a\n      cut-throat Socialist, who says openly he would steal anything from a\n      richer man. This is the end of it. Here is the richer man\u2014and none\n      the richer.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIf you want the inside of my head you can have it,\u201d said Brown rather\n      wearily. \u201cWhat it\u2019s worth you can say afterwards. But the first thing I\n      find in that disused pocket is this: that men who mean to steal diamonds\n      don\u2019t talk Socialism. They are more likely,\u201d he added demurely, \u201cto\n      denounce it.\u201d\n     \n\n      Both the others shifted sharply and the priest went on:\n    \n\n      \u201cYou see, we know these people, more or less. That Socialist would no more\n      steal a diamond than a Pyramid. We ought to look at once to the one man we\n      don\u2019t know. The fellow acting the policeman\u2014Florian. Where is he\n      exactly at this minute, I wonder.\u201d\n     \n\n      The pantaloon sprang erect and strode out of the room. An interlude\n      ensued, during which the millionaire stared at the priest, and the priest\n      at his breviary; then the pantaloon returned and said, with staccato\n      gravity, \u201cThe policeman is still lying on the stage. The curtain has gone\n      up and down six times; he is still lying there.\u201d\n     \n\n      Father Brown dropped his book and stood staring with a look of blank\n      mental ruin. Very slowly a light began to creep in his grey eyes, and then\n      he made the scarcely obvious answer.\n    \n\n      \u201cPlease forgive me, colonel, but when did your wife die?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWife!\u201d replied the staring soldier, \u201cshe died this year two months. Her\n      brother James arrived just a week too late to see her.\u201d\n     \n\n      The little priest bounded like a rabbit shot. \u201cCome on!\u201d he cried in quite\n      unusual excitement. \u201cCome on! We\u2019ve got to go and look at that policeman!\u201d\n     \n\n      They rushed on to the now curtained stage, breaking rudely past the\n      columbine and clown (who seemed whispering quite contentedly), and Father\n      Brown bent over the prostrate comic policeman.\n    \n\n      \u201cChloroform,\u201d he said as he rose; \u201cI only guessed it just now.\u201d\n     \n\n      There was a startled stillness, and then the colonel said slowly, \u201cPlease\n      say seriously what all this means.\u201d\n     \n\n      Father Brown suddenly shouted with laughter, then stopped, and only\n      struggled with it for instants during the rest of his speech. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d\n       he gasped, \u201cthere\u2019s not much time to talk. I must run after the criminal.\n      But this great French actor who played the policeman\u2014this clever\n      corpse the harlequin waltzed with and dandled and threw about\u2014he was\u2014\u201d\n       His voice again failed him, and he turned his back to run.\n    \n\n      \u201cHe was?\u201d called Fischer inquiringly.\n    \n\n      \u201cA real policeman,\u201d said Father Brown, and ran away into the dark.\n    \n\n      There were hollows and bowers at the extreme end of that leafy garden, in\n      which the laurels and other immortal shrubs showed against sapphire sky\n      and silver moon, even in that midwinter, warm colours as of the south. The\n      green gaiety of the waving laurels, the rich purple indigo of the night,\n      the moon like a monstrous crystal, make an almost irresponsible romantic\n      picture; and among the top branches of the garden trees a strange figure\n      is climbing, who looks not so much romantic as impossible. He sparkles\n      from head to heel, as if clad in ten million moons; the real moon catches\n      him at every movement and sets a new inch of him on fire. But he swings,\n      flashing and successful, from the short tree in this garden to the tall,\n      rambling tree in the other, and only stops there because a shade has slid\n      under the smaller tree and has unmistakably called up to him.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell, Flambeau,\u201d says the voice, \u201cyou really look like a Flying Star; but\n      that always means a Falling Star at last.\u201d\n     \n\n      The silver, sparkling figure above seems to lean forward in the laurels\n      and, confident of escape, listens to the little figure below.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou never did anything better, Flambeau. It was clever to come from\n      Canada (with a Paris ticket, I suppose) just a week after Mrs. Adams died,\n      when no one was in a mood to ask questions. It was cleverer to have marked\n      down the Flying Stars and the very day of Fischer\u2019s coming. But there\u2019s no\n      cleverness, but mere genius, in what followed. Stealing the stones, I\n      suppose, was nothing to you. You could have done it by sleight of hand in\n      a hundred other ways besides that pretence of putting a paper donkey\u2019s\n      tail to Fischer\u2019s coat. But in the rest you eclipsed yourself.\u201d\n     \n\n      The silvery figure among the green leaves seems to linger as if\n      hypnotised, though his escape is easy behind him; he is staring at the man\n      below.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, yes,\u201d says the man below, \u201cI know all about it. I know you not only\n      forced the pantomime, but put it to a double use. You were going to steal\n      the stones quietly; news came by an accomplice that you were already\n      suspected, and a capable police officer was coming to rout you up that\n      very night. A common thief would have been thankful for the warning and\n      fled; but you are a poet. You already had the clever notion of hiding the\n      jewels in a blaze of false stage jewellery. Now, you saw that if the dress\n      were a harlequin\u2019s the appearance of a policeman would be quite in\n      keeping. The worthy officer started from Putney police station to find\n      you, and walked into the queerest trap ever set in this world. When the\n      front door opened he walked straight on to the stage of a Christmas\n      pantomime, where he could be kicked, clubbed, stunned and drugged by the\n      dancing harlequin, amid roars of laughter from all the most respectable\n      people in Putney. Oh, you will never do anything better. And now, by the\n      way, you might give me back those diamonds.\u201d\n     \n\n      The green branch on which the glittering figure swung, rustled as if in\n      astonishment; but the voice went on:\n    \n\n      \u201cI want you to give them back, Flambeau, and I want you to give up this\n      life. There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don\u2019t fancy they\n      will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man\n      has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and\n      down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies\n      about it. Many a man I\u2019ve known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a\n      merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime. Maurice Blum\n      started out as an anarchist of principle, a father of the poor; he ended a\n      greasy spy and tale-bearer that both sides used and despised. Harry Burke\n      started his free money movement sincerely enough; now he\u2019s sponging on a\n      half-starved sister for endless brandies and sodas. Lord Amber went into\n      wild society in a sort of chivalry; now he\u2019s paying blackmail to the\n      lowest vultures in London. Captain Barillon was the great gentleman-apache\n      before your time; he died in a madhouse, screaming with fear of the\n      \u201cnarks\u201d and receivers that had betrayed him and hunted him down. I know\n      the woods look very free behind you, Flambeau; I know that in a flash you\n      could melt into them like a monkey. But some day you will be an old grey\n      monkey, Flambeau. You will sit up in your free forest cold at heart and\n      close to death, and the tree-tops will be very bare.\u201d\n     \n\n      Everything continued still, as if the small man below held the other in\n      the tree in some long invisible leash; and he went on:\n    \n\n      \u201cYour downward steps have begun. You used to boast of doing nothing mean,\n      but you are doing something mean tonight. You are leaving suspicion on an\n      honest boy with a good deal against him already; you are separating him\n      from the woman he loves and who loves him. But you will do meaner things\n      than that before you die.\u201d\n     \n\n      Three flashing diamonds fell from the tree to the turf. The small man\n      stooped to pick them up, and when he looked up again the green cage of the\n      tree was emptied of its silver bird.\n    \n\n      The restoration of the gems (accidentally picked up by Father Brown, of\n      all people) ended the evening in uproarious triumph; and Sir Leopold, in\n      his height of good humour, even told the priest that though he himself had\n      broader views, he could respect those whose creed required them to be\n      cloistered and ignorant of this world.\n    ",
