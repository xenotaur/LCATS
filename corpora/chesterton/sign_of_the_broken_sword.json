    "name": "Chesterton - The Sign Of the Broken Sword",
    "body": "\n      The thousand arms of the forest were grey, and its million fingers silver.\n      In a sky of dark green-blue-like slate the stars were bleak and brilliant\n      like splintered ice. All that thickly wooded and sparsely tenanted\n      countryside was stiff with a bitter and brittle frost. The black hollows\n      between the trunks of the trees looked like bottomless, black caverns of\n      that Scandinavian hell, a hell of incalculable cold. Even the square stone\n      tower of the church looked northern to the point of heathenry, as if it\n      were some barbaric tower among the sea rocks of Iceland. It was a queer\n      night for anyone to explore a churchyard. But, on the other hand, perhaps\n      it was worth exploring.\n    \n\n      It rose abruptly out of the ashen wastes of forest in a sort of hump or\n      shoulder of green turf that looked grey in the starlight. Most of the\n      graves were on a slant, and the path leading up to the church was as steep\n      as a staircase. On the top of the hill, in the one flat and prominent\n      place, was the monument for which the place was famous. It contrasted\n      strangely with the featureless graves all round, for it was the work of\n      one of the greatest sculptors of modern Europe; and yet his fame was at\n      once forgotten in the fame of the man whose image he had made. It showed,\n      by touches of the small silver pencil of starlight, the massive metal\n      figure of a soldier recumbent, the strong hands sealed in an everlasting\n      worship, the great head pillowed upon a gun. The venerable face was\n      bearded, or rather whiskered, in the old, heavy Colonel Newcome fashion.\n      The uniform, though suggested with the few strokes of simplicity, was that\n      of modern war. By his right side lay a sword, of which the tip was broken\n      off; on the left side lay a Bible. On glowing summer afternoons wagonettes\n      came full of Americans and cultured suburbans to see the sepulchre; but\n      even then they felt the vast forest land with its one dumpy dome of\n      churchyard and church as a place oddly dumb and neglected. In this\n      freezing darkness of mid-winter one would think he might be left alone\n      with the stars. Nevertheless, in the stillness of those stiff woods a\n      wooden gate creaked, and two dim figures dressed in black climbed up the\n      little path to the tomb.\n    \n\n      So faint was that frigid starlight that nothing could have been traced\n      about them except that while they both wore black, one man was enormously\n      big, and the other (perhaps by contrast) almost startlingly small. They\n      went up to the great graven tomb of the historic warrior, and stood for a\n      few minutes staring at it. There was no human, perhaps no living, thing\n      for a wide circle; and a morbid fancy might well have wondered if they\n      were human themselves. In any case, the beginning of their conversation\n      might have seemed strange. After the first silence the small man said to\n      the other:\n    \n\n      \u201cWhere does a wise man hide a pebble?\u201d\n     \n\n      And the tall man answered in a low voice: \u201cOn the beach.\u201d\n     \n\n      The small man nodded, and after a short silence said: \u201cWhere does a wise\n      man hide a leaf?\u201d\n     \n\n      And the other answered: \u201cIn the forest.\u201d\n     \n\n      There was another stillness, and then the tall man resumed: \u201cDo you mean\n      that when a wise man has to hide a real diamond he has been known to hide\n      it among sham ones?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNo, no,\u201d said the little man with a laugh, \u201cwe will let bygones be\n      bygones.\u201d\n     \n\n      He stamped his cold feet for a second or two, and then said: \u201cI\u2019m not\n      thinking of that at all, but of something else; something rather peculiar.\n      Just strike a match, will you?\u201d\n     \n\n      The big man fumbled in his pocket, and soon a scratch and a flare painted\n      gold the whole flat side of the monument. On it was cut in black letters\n      the well-known words which so many Americans had reverently read: \u201cSacred\n      to the Memory of General Sir Arthur St. Clare, Hero and Martyr, who Always\n      Vanquished his Enemies and Always Spared Them, and Was Treacherously Slain\n      by Them At Last. May God in Whom he Trusted both Reward and Revenge him.\u201d\n     \n\n      The match burnt the big man\u2019s fingers, blackened, and dropped. He was\n      about to strike another, but his small companion stopped him. \u201cThat\u2019s all\n      right, Flambeau, old man; I saw what I wanted. Or, rather, I didn\u2019t see\n      what I didn\u2019t want. And now we must walk a mile and a half along the road\n      to the next inn, and I will try to tell you all about it. For Heaven knows\n      a man should have a fire and ale when he dares tell such a story.\u201d\n     \n\n      They descended the precipitous path, they relatched the rusty gate, and\n      set off at a stamping, ringing walk down the frozen forest road. They had\n      gone a full quarter of a mile before the smaller man spoke again. He said:\n      \u201cYes; the wise man hides a pebble on the beach. But what does he do if\n      there is no beach? Do you know anything of that great St. Clare trouble?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI know nothing about English generals, Father Brown,\u201d answered the large\n      man, laughing, \u201cthough a little about English policemen. I only know that\n      you have dragged me a precious long dance to all the shrines of this\n      fellow, whoever he is. One would think he got buried in six different\n      places. I\u2019ve seen a memorial to General St. Clare in Westminster Abbey.\n      I\u2019ve seen a ramping equestrian statue of General St. Clare on the\n      Embankment. I\u2019ve seen a medallion of St. Clare in the street he was born\n      in, and another in the street he lived in; and now you drag me after dark\n      to his coffin in the village churchyard. I am beginning to be a bit tired\n      of his magnificent personality, especially as I don\u2019t in the least know\n      who he was. What are you hunting for in all these crypts and effigies?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI am only looking for one word,\u201d said Father Brown. \u201cA word that isn\u2019t\n      there.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell,\u201d asked Flambeau; \u201care you going to tell me anything about it?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI must divide it into two parts,\u201d remarked the priest. \u201cFirst there is\n      what everybody knows; and then there is what I know. Now, what everybody\n      knows is short and plain enough. It is also entirely wrong.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cRight you are,\u201d said the big man called Flambeau cheerfully. \u201cLet\u2019s begin\n      at the wrong end. Let\u2019s begin with what everybody knows, which isn\u2019t\n      true.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIf not wholly untrue, it is at least very inadequate,\u201d continued Brown;\n      \u201cfor in point of fact, all that the public knows amounts precisely to\n      this: The public knows that Arthur St. Clare was a great and successful\n      English general. It knows that after splendid yet careful campaigns both\n      in India and Africa he was in command against Brazil when the great\n      Brazilian patriot Olivier issued his ultimatum. It knows that on that\n      occasion St. Clare with a very small force attacked Olivier with a very\n      large one, and was captured after heroic resistance. And it knows that\n      after his capture, and to the abhorrence of the civilised world, St. Clare\n      was hanged on the nearest tree. He was found swinging there after the\n      Brazilians had retired, with his broken sword hung round his neck.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAnd that popular story is untrue?\u201d suggested Flambeau.\n    \n\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said his friend quietly, \u201cthat story is quite true, so far as it\n      goes.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, I think it goes far enough!\u201d said Flambeau; \u201cbut if the popular\n      story is true, what is the mystery?\u201d\n     \n\n      They had passed many hundreds of grey and ghostly trees before the little\n      priest answered. Then he bit his finger reflectively and said: \u201cWhy, the\n      mystery is a mystery of psychology. Or, rather, it is a mystery of two\n      psychologies. In that Brazilian business two of the most famous men of\n      modern history acted flat against their characters. Mind you, Olivier and\n      St. Clare were both heroes\u2014the old thing, and no mistake; it was\n      like the fight between Hector and Achilles. Now, what would you say to an\n      affair in which Achilles was timid and Hector was treacherous?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cGo on,\u201d said the large man impatiently as the other bit his finger again.\n    \n\n      \u201cSir Arthur St. Clare was a soldier of the old religious type\u2014the\n      type that saved us during the Mutiny,\u201d continued Brown. \u201cHe was always\n      more for duty than for dash; and with all his personal courage was\n      decidedly a prudent commander, particularly indignant at any needless\n      waste of soldiers. Yet in this last battle he attempted something that a\n      baby could see was absurd. One need not be a strategist to see it was as\n      wild as wind; just as one need not be a strategist to keep out of the way\n      of a motor-bus. Well, that is the first mystery; what had become of the\n      English general\u2019s head? The second riddle is, what had become of the\n      Brazilian general\u2019s heart? President Olivier might be called a visionary\n      or a nuisance; but even his enemies admitted that he was magnanimous to\n      the point of knight errantry. Almost every other prisoner he had ever\n      captured had been set free or even loaded with benefits. Men who had\n      really wronged him came away touched by his simplicity and sweetness. Why\n      the deuce should he diabolically revenge himself only once in his life;\n      and that for the one particular blow that could not have hurt him? Well,\n      there you have it. One of the wisest men in the world acted like an idiot\n      for no reason. One of the best men in the world acted like a fiend for no\n      reason. That\u2019s the long and the short of it; and I leave it to you, my\n      boy.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d said the other with a snort. \u201cI leave it to you; and you\n      jolly well tell me all about it.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell,\u201d resumed Father Brown, \u201cit\u2019s not fair to say that the public\n      impression is just what I\u2019ve said, without adding that two things have\n      happened since. I can\u2019t say they threw a new light; for nobody can make\n      sense of them. But they threw a new kind of darkness; they threw the\n      darkness in new directions. The first was this. The family physician of\n      the St. Clares quarrelled with that family, and began publishing a violent\n      series of articles, in which he said that the late general was a religious\n      maniac; but as far as the tale went, this seemed to mean little more than\n      a religious man.\n    \n\n      \u201cAnyhow, the story fizzled out. Everyone knew, of course, that St. Clare\n      had some of the eccentricities of puritan piety. The second incident was\n      much more arresting. In the luckless and unsupported regiment which made\n      that rash attempt at the Black River there was a certain Captain Keith,\n      who was at that time engaged to St. Clare\u2019s daughter, and who afterwards\n      married her. He was one of those who were captured by Olivier, and, like\n      all the rest except the general, appears to have been bounteously treated\n      and promptly set free. Some twenty years afterwards this man, then\n      Lieutenant-Colonel Keith, published a sort of autobiography called \u2018A\n      British Officer in Burmah and Brazil.\u2019 In the place where the reader looks\n      eagerly for some account of the mystery of St. Clare\u2019s disaster may be\n      found the following words: \u2018Everywhere else in this book I have narrated\n      things exactly as they occurred, holding as I do the old-fashioned opinion\n      that the glory of England is old enough to take care of itself. The\n      exception I shall make is in this matter of the defeat by the Black River;\n      and my reasons, though private, are honourable and compelling. I will,\n      however, add this in justice to the memories of two distinguished men.\n      General St. Clare has been accused of incapacity on this occasion; I can\n      at least testify that this action, properly understood, was one of the\n      most brilliant and sagacious of his life. President Olivier by similar\n      report is charged with savage injustice. I think it due to the honour of\n      an enemy to say that he acted on this occasion with even more than his\n      characteristic good feeling. To put the matter popularly, I can assure my\n      countrymen that St. Clare was by no means such a fool nor Olivier such a\n      brute as he looked. This is all I have to say; nor shall any earthly\n      consideration induce me to add a word to it.\u2019\u201d\n     \n\n      A large frozen moon like a lustrous snowball began to show through the\n      tangle of twigs in front of them, and by its light the narrator had been\n      able to refresh his memory of Captain Keith\u2019s text from a scrap of printed\n      paper. As he folded it up and put it back in his pocket Flambeau threw up\n      his hand with a French gesture.\n    \n\n      \u201cWait a bit, wait a bit,\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cI believe I can guess it at\n      the first go.\u201d\n     \n\n      He strode on, breathing hard, his black head and bull neck forward, like a\n      man winning a walking race. The little priest, amused and interested, had\n      some trouble in trotting beside him. Just before them the trees fell back\n      a little to left and right, and the road swept downwards across a clear,\n      moonlit valley, till it dived again like a rabbit into the wall of another\n      wood. The entrance to the farther forest looked small and round, like the\n      black hole of a remote railway tunnel. But it was within some hundred\n      yards, and gaped like a cavern before Flambeau spoke again.\n    \n\n      \u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d he cried at last, slapping his thigh with his great hand.\n      \u201cFour minutes\u2019 thinking, and I can tell your whole story myself.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAll right,\u201d assented his friend. \u201cYou tell it.\u201d\n     \n\n      Flambeau lifted his head, but lowered his voice. \u201cGeneral Sir Arthur St.\n      Clare,\u201d he said, \u201ccame of a family in which madness was hereditary; and\n      his whole aim was to keep this from his daughter, and even, if possible,\n      from his future son-in-law. Rightly or wrongly, he thought the final\n      collapse was close, and resolved on suicide. Yet ordinary suicide would\n      blazon the very idea he dreaded. As the campaign approached the clouds\n      came thicker on his brain; and at last in a mad moment he sacrificed his\n      public duty to his private. He rushed rashly into battle, hoping to fall\n      by the first shot. When he found that he had only attained capture and\n      discredit, the sealed bomb in his brain burst, and he broke his own sword\n      and hanged himself.\u201d\n     \n\n      He stared firmly at the grey fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of forest in front of him, with the\n      one black gap in it, like the mouth of the grave, into which their path\n      plunged. Perhaps something menacing in the road thus suddenly swallowed\n      reinforced his vivid vision of the tragedy, for he shuddered.\n    \n\n      \u201cA horrid story,\u201d he said.\n    \n\n      \u201cA horrid story,\u201d repeated the priest with bent head. \u201cBut not the real\n      story.\u201d\n     \n\n      Then he threw back his head with a sort of despair and cried: \u201cOh, I wish\n      it had been.\u201d\n     \n\n      The tall Flambeau faced round and stared at him.\n    \n\n      \u201cYours is a clean story,\u201d cried Father Brown, deeply moved. \u201cA sweet,\n      pure, honest story, as open and white as that moon. Madness and despair\n      are innocent enough. There are worse things, Flambeau.\u201d\n     \n\n      Flambeau looked up wildly at the moon thus invoked; and from where he\n      stood one black tree-bough curved across it exactly like a devil\u2019s horn.\n    \n\n      \u201cFather\u2014father,\u201d cried Flambeau with the French gesture and stepping\n      yet more rapidly forward, \u201cdo you mean it was worse than that?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWorse than that,\u201d said Paul like a grave echo. And they plunged into the\n      black cloister of the woodland, which ran by them in a dim tapestry of\n      trunks, like one of the dark corridors in a dream.\n    \n\n      They were soon in the most secret entrails of the wood, and felt close\n      about them foliage that they could not see, when the priest said again:\n    \n\n      \u201cWhere does a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest. But what does he do if\n      there is no forest?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, well,\u201d cried Flambeau irritably, \u201cwhat does he do?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHe grows a forest to hide it in,\u201d said the priest in an obscure voice. \u201cA\n      fearful sin.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cLook here,\u201d cried his friend impatiently, for the dark wood and the dark\n      saying got a little on his nerves; \u201cwill you tell me this story or not?\n      What other evidence is there to go on?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThere are three more bits of evidence,\u201d said the other, \u201cthat I have dug\n      up in holes and corners; and I will give them in logical rather than\n      chronological order. First of all, of course, our authority for the issue\n      and event of the battle is in Olivier\u2019s own dispatches, which are lucid\n      enough. He was entrenched with two or three regiments on the heights that\n      swept down to the Black River, on the other side of which was lower and\n      more marshy ground. Beyond this again was gently rising country, on which\n      was the first English outpost, supported by others which lay, however,\n      considerably in its rear. The British forces as a whole were greatly\n      superior in numbers; but this particular regiment was just far enough from\n      its base to make Olivier consider the project of crossing the river to cut\n      it off. By sunset, however, he had decided to retain his own position,\n      which was a specially strong one. At daybreak next morning he was\n      thunderstruck to see that this stray handful of English, entirely\n      unsupported from their rear, had flung themselves across the river, half\n      by a bridge to the right, and the other half by a ford higher up, and were\n      massed upon the marshy bank below him.\n    \n\n      \u201cThat they should attempt an attack with such numbers against such a\n      position was incredible enough; but Olivier noticed something yet more\n      extraordinary. For instead of attempting to seize more solid ground, this\n      mad regiment, having put the river in its rear by one wild charge, did\n      nothing more, but stuck there in the mire like flies in treacle. Needless\n      to say, the Brazilians blew great gaps in them with artillery, which they\n      could only return with spirited but lessening rifle fire. Yet they never\n      broke; and Olivier\u2019s curt account ends with a strong tribute of admiration\n      for the mystic valour of these imbeciles. \u2018Our line then advanced\n      finally,\u2019 writes Olivier, \u2018and drove them into the river; we captured\n      General St. Clare himself and several other officers. The colonel and the\n      major had both fallen in the battle. I cannot resist saying that few finer\n      sights can have been seen in history than the last stand of this\n      extraordinary regiment; wounded officers picking up the rifles of dead\n      soldiers, and the general himself facing us on horseback bareheaded and\n      with a broken sword.\u2019 On what happened to the general afterwards Olivier\n      is as silent as Captain Keith.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell,\u201d grunted Flambeau, \u201cget on to the next bit of evidence.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThe next evidence,\u201d said Father Brown, \u201ctook some time to find, but it\n      will not take long to tell. I found at last in an almshouse down in the\n      Lincolnshire Fens an old soldier who not only was wounded at the Black\n      River, but had actually knelt beside the colonel of the regiment when he\n      died. This latter was a certain Colonel Clancy, a big bull of an Irishman;\n      and it would seem that he died almost as much of rage as of bullets. He,\n      at any rate, was not responsible for that ridiculous raid; it must have\n      been imposed on him by the general. His last edifying words, according to\n      my informant, were these: \u2018And there goes the damned old donkey with the\n      end of his sword knocked off. I wish it was his head.\u2019 You will remark\n      that everyone seems to have noticed this detail about the broken sword\n      blade, though most people regard it somewhat more reverently than did the\n      late Colonel Clancy. And now for the third fragment.\u201d\n     \n\n      Their path through the woodland began to go upward, and the speaker paused\n      a little for breath before he went on. Then he continued in the same\n      business-like tone:\n    \n\n      \u201cOnly a month or two ago a certain Brazilian official died in England,\n      having quarrelled with Olivier and left his country. He was a well-known\n      figure both here and on the Continent, a Spaniard named Espado; I knew him\n      myself, a yellow-faced old dandy, with a hooked nose. For various private\n      reasons I had permission to see the documents he had left; he was a\n      Catholic, of course, and I had been with him towards the end. There was\n      nothing of his that lit up any corner of the black St. Clare business,\n      except five or six common exercise books filled with the diary of some\n      English soldier. I can only suppose that it was found by the Brazilians on\n      one of those that fell. Anyhow, it stopped abruptly the night before the\n      battle.\n    \n\n      \u201cBut the account of that last day in the poor fellow\u2019s life was certainly\n      worth reading. I have it on me; but it\u2019s too dark to read it here, and I\n      will give you a resume. The first part of that entry is full of jokes,\n      evidently flung about among the men, about somebody called the Vulture. It\n      does not seem as if this person, whoever he was, was one of themselves,\n      nor even an Englishman; neither is he exactly spoken of as one of the\n      enemy. It sounds rather as if he were some local go-between and\n      non-combatant; perhaps a guide or a journalist. He has been closeted with\n      old Colonel Clancy; but is more often seen talking to the major. Indeed,\n      the major is somewhat prominent in this soldier\u2019s narrative; a lean,\n      dark-haired man, apparently, of the name of Murray\u2014a north of\n      Ireland man and a Puritan. There are continual jests about the contrast\n      between this Ulsterman\u2019s austerity and the conviviality of Colonel Clancy.\n      There is also some joke about the Vulture wearing bright-coloured clothes.\n    \n\n      \u201cBut all these levities are scattered by what may well be called the note\n      of a bugle. Behind the English camp and almost parallel to the river ran\n      one of the few great roads of that district. Westward the road curved\n      round towards the river, which it crossed by the bridge before mentioned.\n      To the east the road swept backwards into the wilds, and some two miles\n      along it was the next English outpost. From this direction there came\n      along the road that evening a glitter and clatter of light cavalry, in\n      which even the simple diarist could recognise with astonishment the\n      general with his staff. He rode the great white horse which you have seen\n      so often in illustrated papers and Academy pictures; and you may be sure\n      that the salute they gave him was not merely ceremonial. He, at least,\n      wasted no time on ceremony, but, springing from the saddle immediately,\n      mixed with the group of officers, and fell into emphatic though\n      confidential speech. What struck our friend the diarist most was his\n      special disposition to discuss matters with Major Murray; but, indeed,\n      such a selection, so long as it was not marked, was in no way unnatural.\n      The two men were made for sympathy; they were men who \u2018read their Bibles\u2019;\n      they were both the old Evangelical type of officer. However this may be,\n      it is certain that when the general mounted again he was still talking\n      earnestly to Murray; and that as he walked his horse slowly down the road\n      towards the river, the tall Ulsterman still walked by his bridle rein in\n      earnest debate. The soldiers watched the two until they vanished behind a\n      clump of trees where the road turned towards the river. The colonel had\n      gone back to his tent, and the men to their pickets; the man with the\n      diary lingered for another four minutes, and saw a marvellous sight.\n    \n\n      \u201cThe great white horse which had marched slowly down the road, as it had\n      marched in so many processions, flew back, galloping up the road towards\n      them as if it were mad to win a race. At first they thought it had run\n      away with the man on its back; but they soon saw that the general, a fine\n      rider, was himself urging it to full speed. Horse and man swept up to them\n      like a whirlwind; and then, reining up the reeling charger, the general\n      turned on them a face like flame, and called for the colonel like the\n      trumpet that wakes the dead.\n    \n\n      \u201cI conceive that all the earthquake events of that catastrophe tumbled on\n      top of each other rather like lumber in the minds of men such as our\n      friend with the diary. With the dazed excitement of a dream, they found\n      themselves falling\u2014literally falling\u2014into their ranks, and\n      learned that an attack was to be led at once across the river. The general\n      and the major, it was said, had found out something at the bridge, and\n      there was only just time to strike for life. The major had gone back at\n      once to call up the reserve along the road behind; it was doubtful if even\n      with that prompt appeal help could reach them in time. But they must pass\n      the stream that night, and seize the heights by morning. It is with the\n      very stir and throb of that romantic nocturnal march that the diary\n      suddenly ends.\u201d\n     \n\n      Father Brown had mounted ahead; for the woodland path grew smaller,\n      steeper, and more twisted, till they felt as if they were ascending a\n      winding staircase. The priest\u2019s voice came from above out of the darkness.\n    \n\n      \u201cThere was one other little and enormous thing. When the general urged\n      them to their chivalric charge he half drew his sword from the scabbard;\n      and then, as if ashamed of such melodrama, thrust it back again. The sword\n      again, you see.\u201d\n     \n\n      A half-light broke through the network of boughs above them, flinging the\n      ghost of a net about their feet; for they were mounting again to the faint\n      luminosity of the naked night. Flambeau felt truth all round him as an\n      atmosphere, but not as an idea. He answered with bewildered brain: \u201cWell,\n      what\u2019s the matter with the sword? Officers generally have swords, don\u2019t\n      they?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThey are not often mentioned in modern war,\u201d said the other\n      dispassionately; \u201cbut in this affair one falls over the blessed sword\n      everywhere.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, what is there in that?\u201d growled Flambeau; \u201cit was a twopence\n      coloured sort of incident; the old man\u2019s blade breaking in his last\n      battle. Anyone might bet the papers would get hold of it, as they have. On\n      all these tombs and things it\u2019s shown broken at the point. I hope you\n      haven\u2019t dragged me through this Polar expedition merely because two men\n      with an eye for a picture saw St. Clare\u2019s broken sword.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNo,\u201d cried Father Brown, with a sharp voice like a pistol shot; \u201cbut who\n      saw his unbroken sword?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d cried the other, and stood still under the stars. They\n      had come abruptly out of the grey gates of the wood.\n    \n\n      \u201cI say, who saw his unbroken sword?\u201d repeated Father Brown obstinately.\n      \u201cNot the writer of the diary, anyhow; the general sheathed it in time.\u201d\n     \n\n      Flambeau looked about him in the moonlight, as a man struck blind might\n      look in the sun; and his friend went on, for the first time with\n      eagerness:\n    \n\n      \u201cFlambeau,\u201d he cried, \u201cI cannot prove it, even after hunting through the\n      tombs. But I am sure of it. Let me add just one more tiny fact that tips\n      the whole thing over. The colonel, by a strange chance, was one of the\n      first struck by a bullet. He was struck long before the troops came to\n      close quarters. But he saw St. Clare\u2019s sword broken. Why was it broken?\n      How was it broken? My friend, it was broken before the battle.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOh!\u201d said his friend, with a sort of forlorn jocularity; \u201cand pray where\n      is the other piece?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI can tell you,\u201d said the priest promptly. \u201cIn the northeast corner of\n      the cemetery of the Protestant Cathedral at Belfast.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIndeed?\u201d inquired the other. \u201cHave you looked for it?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d replied Brown, with frank regret. \u201cThere\u2019s a great marble\n      monument on top of it; a monument to the heroic Major Murray, who fell\n      fighting gloriously at the famous Battle of the Black River.\u201d\n     \n\n      Flambeau seemed suddenly galvanised into existence. \u201cYou mean,\u201d he cried\n      hoarsely, \u201cthat General St. Clare hated Murray, and murdered him on the\n      field of battle because\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYou are still full of good and pure thoughts,\u201d said the other. \u201cIt was\n      worse than that.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell,\u201d said the large man, \u201cmy stock of evil imagination is used up.\u201d\n     \n\n      The priest seemed really doubtful where to begin, and at last he said\n      again:\n    \n\n      \u201cWhere would a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest.\u201d\n     \n\n      The other did not answer.\n    \n\n      \u201cIf there were no forest, he would make a forest. And if he wished to hide\n      a dead leaf, he would make a dead forest.\u201d\n     \n\n      There was still no reply, and the priest added still more mildly and\n      quietly:\n    \n\n      \u201cAnd if a man had to hide a dead body, he would make a field of dead\n      bodies to hide it in.\u201d\n     \n\n      Flambeau began to stamp forward with an intolerance of delay in time or\n      space; but Father Brown went on as if he were continuing the last\n      sentence:\n    \n\n      \u201cSir Arthur St. Clare, as I have already said, was a man who read his\n      Bible. That was what was the matter with him. When will people understand\n      that it is useless for a man to read his Bible unless he also reads\n      everybody else\u2019s Bible? A printer reads a Bible for misprints. A Mormon\n      reads his Bible, and finds polygamy; a Christian Scientist reads his, and\n      finds we have no arms and legs. St. Clare was an old Anglo-Indian\n      Protestant soldier. Now, just think what that might mean; and, for\n      Heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t cant about it. It might mean a man physically\n      formidable living under a tropic sun in an Oriental society, and soaking\n      himself without sense or guidance in an Oriental Book. Of course, he read\n      the Old Testament rather than the New. Of course, he found in the Old\n      Testament anything that he wanted\u2014lust, tyranny, treason. Oh, I dare\n      say he was honest, as you call it. But what is the good of a man being\n      honest in his worship of dishonesty?\n    \n\n      \u201cIn each of the hot and secret countries to which the man went he kept a\n      harem, he tortured witnesses, he amassed shameful gold; but certainly he\n      would have said with steady eyes that he did it to the glory of the Lord.\n      My own theology is sufficiently expressed by asking which Lord? Anyhow,\n      there is this about such evil, that it opens door after door in hell, and\n      always into smaller and smaller chambers. This is the real case against\n      crime, that a man does not become wilder and wilder, but only meaner and\n      meaner. St. Clare was soon suffocated by difficulties of bribery and\n      blackmail; and needed more and more cash. And by the time of the Battle of\n      the Black River he had fallen from world to world to that place which\n      Dante makes the lowest floor of the universe.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked his friend again.\n    \n\n      \u201cI mean that,\u201d retorted the cleric, and suddenly pointed at a puddle\n      sealed with ice that shone in the moon. \u201cDo you remember whom Dante put in\n      the last circle of ice?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThe traitors,\u201d said Flambeau, and shuddered. As he looked around at the\n      inhuman landscape of trees, with taunting and almost obscene outlines, he\n      could almost fancy he was Dante, and the priest with the rivulet of a\n      voice was, indeed, a Virgil leading him through a land of eternal sins.\n    \n\n      The voice went on: \u201cOlivier, as you know, was quixotic, and would not\n      permit a secret service and spies. The thing, however, was done, like many\n      other things, behind his back. It was managed by my old friend Espado; he\n      was the bright-clad fop, whose hook nose got him called the Vulture.\n      Posing as a sort of philanthropist at the front, he felt his way through\n      the English Army, and at last got his fingers on its one corrupt man\u2014please\n      God!\u2014and that man at the top. St. Clare was in foul need of money,\n      and mountains of it. The discredited family doctor was threatening those\n      extraordinary exposures that afterwards began and were broken off; tales\n      of monstrous and prehistoric things in Park Lane; things done by an\n      English Evangelist that smelt like human sacrifice and hordes of slaves.\n      Money was wanted, too, for his daughter\u2019s dowry; for to him the fame of\n      wealth was as sweet as wealth itself. He snapped the last thread,\n      whispered the word to Brazil, and wealth poured in from the enemies of\n      England. But another man had talked to Espado the Vulture as well as he.\n      Somehow the dark, grim young major from Ulster had guessed the hideous\n      truth; and when they walked slowly together down that road towards the\n      bridge Murray was telling the general that he must resign instantly, or be\n      court-martialled and shot. The general temporised with him till they came\n      to the fringe of tropic trees by the bridge; and there by the singing\n      river and the sunlit palms (for I can see the picture) the general drew\n      his sabre and plunged it through the body of the major.\u201d\n     \n\n      The wintry road curved over a ridge in cutting frost, with cruel black\n      shapes of bush and thicket; but Flambeau fancied that he saw beyond it\n      faintly the edge of an aureole that was not starlight and moonlight, but\n      some fire such as is made by men. He watched it as the tale drew to its\n      close.\n    \n\n      \u201cSt. Clare was a hell-hound, but he was a hound of breed. Never, I\u2019ll\n      swear, was he so lucid and so strong as when poor Murray lay a cold lump\n      at his feet. Never in all his triumphs, as Captain Keith said truly, was\n      the great man so great as he was in this last world-despised defeat. He\n      looked coolly at his weapon to wipe off the blood; he saw the point he had\n      planted between his victim\u2019s shoulders had broken off in the body. He saw\n      quite calmly, as through a club windowpane, all that must follow. He saw\n      that men must find the unaccountable corpse; must extract the\n      unaccountable sword-point; must notice the unaccountable broken sword\u2014or\n      absence of sword. He had killed, but not silenced. But his imperious\n      intellect rose against the facer; there was one way yet. He could make the\n      corpse less unaccountable. He could create a hill of corpses to cover this\n      one. In twenty minutes eight hundred English soldiers were marching down\n      to their death.\u201d\n     \n\n      The warmer glow behind the black winter wood grew richer and brighter, and\n      Flambeau strode on to reach it. Father Brown also quickened his stride;\n      but he seemed merely absorbed in his tale.\n    \n\n      \u201cSuch was the valour of that English thousand, and such the genius of\n      their commander, that if they had at once attacked the hill, even their\n      mad march might have met some luck. But the evil mind that played with\n      them like pawns had other aims and reasons. They must remain in the\n      marshes by the bridge at least till British corpses should be a common\n      sight there. Then for the last grand scene; the silver-haired\n      soldier-saint would give up his shattered sword to save further slaughter.\n      Oh, it was well organised for an impromptu. But I think (I cannot prove),\n      I think that it was while they stuck there in the bloody mire that someone\n      doubted\u2014and someone guessed.\u201d\n     \n\n      He was mute a moment, and then said: \u201cThere is a voice from nowhere that\n      tells me the man who guessed was the lover... the man to wed the old man\u2019s\n      child.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cBut what about Olivier and the hanging?\u201d asked Flambeau.\n    \n\n      \u201cOlivier, partly from chivalry, partly from policy, seldom encumbered his\n      march with captives,\u201d explained the narrator. \u201cHe released everybody in\n      most cases. He released everybody in this case.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cEverybody but the general,\u201d said the tall man.\n    \n\n      \u201cEverybody,\u201d said the priest.\n    \n\n      Flambeau knit his black brows. \u201cI don\u2019t grasp it all yet,\u201d he said.\n    \n\n      \u201cThere is another picture, Flambeau,\u201d said Brown in his more mystical\n      undertone. \u201cI can\u2019t prove it; but I can do more\u2014I can see it. There\n      is a camp breaking up on the bare, torrid hills at morning, and Brazilian\n      uniforms massed in blocks and columns to march. There is the red shirt and\n      long black beard of Olivier, which blows as he stands, his broad-brimmed\n      hat in his hand. He is saying farewell to the great enemy he is setting\n      free\u2014the simple, snow-headed English veteran, who thanks him in the\n      name of his men. The English remnant stand behind at attention; beside\n      them are stores and vehicles for the retreat. The drums roll; the\n      Brazilians are moving; the English are still like statues. So they abide\n      till the last hum and flash of the enemy have faded from the tropic\n      horizon. Then they alter their postures all at once, like dead men coming\n      to life; they turn their fifty faces upon the general\u2014faces not to\n      be forgotten.\u201d\n     \n\n      Flambeau gave a great jump. \u201cAh,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said Father Brown in a deep, moving voice. \u201cIt was an English hand\n      that put the rope round St. Clare\u2019s neck; I believe the hand that put the\n      ring on his daughter\u2019s finger. They were English hands that dragged him up\n      to the tree of shame; the hands of men that had adored him and followed\n      him to victory. And they were English souls (God pardon and endure us\n      all!) who stared at him swinging in that foreign sun on the green gallows\n      of palm, and prayed in their hatred that he might drop off it into hell.\u201d\n     \n\n      As the two topped the ridge there burst on them the strong scarlet light\n      of a red-curtained English inn. It stood sideways in the road, as if\n      standing aside in the amplitude of hospitality. Its three doors stood open\n      with invitation; and even where they stood they could hear the hum and\n      laughter of humanity happy for a night.\n    \n\n      \u201cI need not tell you more,\u201d said Father Brown. \u201cThey tried him in the\n      wilderness and destroyed him; and then, for the honour of England and of\n      his daughter, they took an oath to seal up for ever the story of the\n      traitor\u2019s purse and the assassin\u2019s sword blade. Perhaps\u2014Heaven help\n      them\u2014they tried to forget it. Let us try to forget it, anyhow; here\n      is our inn.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said Flambeau, and was just striding into the bright,\n      noisy bar when he stepped back and almost fell on the road.\n    \n\n      \u201cLook there, in the devil\u2019s name!\u201d he cried, and pointed rigidly at the\n      square wooden sign that overhung the road. It showed dimly the crude shape\n      of a sabre hilt and a shortened blade; and was inscribed in false archaic\n      lettering, \u201cThe Sign of the Broken Sword.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWere you not prepared?\u201d asked Father Brown gently. \u201cHe is the god of this\n      country; half the inns and parks and streets are named after him and his\n      story.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI thought we had done with the leper,\u201d cried Flambeau, and spat on the\n      road.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou will never have done with him in England,\u201d said the priest, looking\n      down, \u201cwhile brass is strong and stone abides. His marble statues will\n      erect the souls of proud, innocent boys for centuries, his village tomb\n      will smell of loyalty as of lilies. Millions who never knew him shall love\n      him like a father\u2014this man whom the last few that knew him dealt\n      with like dung. He shall be a saint; and the truth shall never be told of\n      him, because I have made up my mind at last. There is so much good and\n      evil in breaking secrets, that I put my conduct to a test. All these\n      newspapers will perish; the anti-Brazil boom is already over; Olivier is\n      already honoured everywhere. But I told myself that if anywhere, by name,\n      in metal or marble that will endure like the pyramids, Colonel Clancy, or\n      Captain Keith, or President Olivier, or any innocent man was wrongly\n      blamed, then I would speak. If it were only that St. Clare was wrongly\n      praised, I would be silent. And I will.\u201d\n     \n\n      They plunged into the red-curtained tavern, which was not only cosy, but\n      even luxurious inside. On a table stood a silver model of the tomb of St.\n      Clare, the silver head bowed, the silver sword broken. On the walls were\n      coloured photographs of the same scene, and of the system of wagonettes\n      that took tourists to see it. They sat down on the comfortable padded\n      benches.\n    \n\n      \u201cCome, it\u2019s cold,\u201d cried Father Brown; \u201clet\u2019s have some wine or beer.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOr brandy,\u201d said Flambeau.\n    ",
