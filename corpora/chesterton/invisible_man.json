    "name": "Chesterton - The Invisible Man",
    "body": "\n      In the cool blue twilight of two steep streets in Camden Town, the shop at\n      the corner, a confectioner\u2019s, glowed like the butt of a cigar. One should\n      rather say, perhaps, like the butt of a firework, for the light was of\n      many colours and some complexity, broken up by many mirrors and dancing on\n      many gilt and gaily-coloured cakes and sweetmeats. Against this one fiery\n      glass were glued the noses of many gutter-snipes, for the chocolates were\n      all wrapped in those red and gold and green metallic colours which are\n      almost better than chocolate itself; and the huge white wedding-cake in\n      the window was somehow at once remote and satisfying, just as if the whole\n      North Pole were good to eat. Such rainbow provocations could naturally\n      collect the youth of the neighbourhood up to the ages of ten or twelve.\n      But this corner was also attractive to youth at a later stage; and a young\n      man, not less than twenty-four, was staring into the same shop window. To\n      him, also, the shop was of fiery charm, but this attraction was not wholly\n      to be explained by chocolates; which, however, he was far from despising.\n    \n\n      He was a tall, burly, red-haired young man, with a resolute face but a\n      listless manner. He carried under his arm a flat, grey portfolio of\n      black-and-white sketches, which he had sold with more or less success to\n      publishers ever since his uncle (who was an admiral) had disinherited him\n      for Socialism, because of a lecture which he had delivered against that\n      economic theory. His name was John Turnbull Angus.\n    \n\n      Entering at last, he walked through the confectioner\u2019s shop to the back\n      room, which was a sort of pastry-cook restaurant, merely raising his hat\n      to the young lady who was serving there. She was a dark, elegant, alert\n      girl in black, with a high colour and very quick, dark eyes; and after the\n      ordinary interval she followed him into the inner room to take his order.\n    \n\n      His order was evidently a usual one. \u201cI want, please,\u201d he said with\n      precision, \u201cone halfpenny bun and a small cup of black coffee.\u201d An instant\n      before the girl could turn away he added, \u201cAlso, I want you to marry me.\u201d\n     \n\n      The young lady of the shop stiffened suddenly and said, \u201cThose are jokes I\n      don\u2019t allow.\u201d\n     \n\n      The red-haired young man lifted grey eyes of an unexpected gravity.\n    \n\n      \u201cReally and truly,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s as serious\u2014as serious as the\n      halfpenny bun. It is expensive, like the bun; one pays for it. It is\n      indigestible, like the bun. It hurts.\u201d\n     \n\n      The dark young lady had never taken her dark eyes off him, but seemed to\n      be studying him with almost tragic exactitude. At the end of her scrutiny\n      she had something like the shadow of a smile, and she sat down in a chair.\n    \n\n      \u201cDon\u2019t you think,\u201d observed Angus, absently, \u201cthat it\u2019s rather cruel to\n      eat these halfpenny buns? They might grow up into penny buns. I shall give\n      up these brutal sports when we are married.\u201d\n     \n\n      The dark young lady rose from her chair and walked to the window,\n      evidently in a state of strong but not unsympathetic cogitation. When at\n      last she swung round again with an air of resolution she was bewildered to\n      observe that the young man was carefully laying out on the table various\n      objects from the shop-window. They included a pyramid of highly coloured\n      sweets, several plates of sandwiches, and the two decanters containing\n      that mysterious port and sherry which are peculiar to pastry-cooks. In the\n      middle of this neat arrangement he had carefully let down the enormous\n      load of white sugared cake which had been the huge ornament of the window.\n    \n\n      \u201cWhat on earth are you doing?\u201d she asked.\n    \n\n      \u201cDuty, my dear Laura,\u201d he began.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, for the Lord\u2019s sake, stop a minute,\u201d she cried, \u201cand don\u2019t talk to me\n      in that way. I mean, what is all that?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cA ceremonial meal, Miss Hope.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d she asked impatiently, pointing to the mountain of\n      sugar.\n    \n\n      \u201cThe wedding-cake, Mrs. Angus,\u201d he said.\n    \n\n      The girl marched to that article, removed it with some clatter, and put it\n      back in the shop window; she then returned, and, putting her elegant\n      elbows on the table, regarded the young man not unfavourably but with\n      considerable exasperation.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t give me any time to think,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n      \u201cI\u2019m not such a fool,\u201d he answered; \u201cthat\u2019s my Christian humility.\u201d\n     \n\n      She was still looking at him; but she had grown considerably graver behind\n      the smile.\n    \n\n      \u201cMr. Angus,\u201d she said steadily, \u201cbefore there is a minute more of this\n      nonsense I must tell you something about myself as shortly as I can.\u2019\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cDelighted,\u201d replied Angus gravely. \u201cYou might tell me something about\n      myself, too, while you are about it.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOh, do hold your tongue and listen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing that I\u2019m\n      ashamed of, and it isn\u2019t even anything that I\u2019m specially sorry about. But\n      what would you say if there were something that is no business of mine and\n      yet is my nightmare?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIn that case,\u201d said the man seriously, \u201cI should suggest that you bring\n      back the cake.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, you must listen to the story first,\u201d said Laura, persistently. \u201cTo\n      begin with, I must tell you that my father owned the inn called the \u2018Red\n      Fish\u2019 at Ludbury, and I used to serve people in the bar.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI have often wondered,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy there was a kind of a Christian air\n      about this one confectioner\u2019s shop.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cLudbury is a sleepy, grassy little hole in the Eastern Counties, and the\n      only kind of people who ever came to the \u2018Red Fish\u2019 were occasional\n      commercial travellers, and for the rest, the most awful people you can\n      see, only you\u2019ve never seen them. I mean little, loungy men, who had just\n      enough to live on and had nothing to do but lean about in bar-rooms and\n      bet on horses, in bad clothes that were just too good for them. Even these\n      wretched young rotters were not very common at our house; but there were\n      two of them that were a lot too common\u2014common in every sort of way.\n      They both lived on money of their own, and were wearisomely idle and\n      over-dressed. But yet I was a bit sorry for them, because I half believe\n      they slunk into our little empty bar because each of them had a slight\n      deformity; the sort of thing that some yokels laugh at. It wasn\u2019t exactly\n      a deformity either; it was more an oddity. One of them was a surprisingly\n      small man, something like a dwarf, or at least like a jockey. He was not\n      at all jockeyish to look at, though; he had a round black head and a\n      well-trimmed black beard, bright eyes like a bird\u2019s; he jingled money in\n      his pockets; he jangled a great gold watch chain; and he never turned up\n      except dressed just too much like a gentleman to be one. He was no fool\n      though, though a futile idler; he was curiously clever at all kinds of\n      things that couldn\u2019t be the slightest use; a sort of impromptu conjuring;\n      making fifteen matches set fire to each other like a regular firework; or\n      cutting a banana or some such thing into a dancing doll. His name was\n      Isidore Smythe; and I can see him still, with his little dark face, just\n      coming up to the counter, making a jumping kangaroo out of five cigars.\n    \n\n      \u201cThe other fellow was more silent and more ordinary; but somehow he\n      alarmed me much more than poor little Smythe. He was very tall and slight,\n      and light-haired; his nose had a high bridge, and he might almost have\n      been handsome in a spectral sort of way; but he had one of the most\n      appalling squints I have ever seen or heard of. When he looked straight at\n      you, you didn\u2019t know where you were yourself, let alone what he was\n      looking at. I fancy this sort of disfigurement embittered the poor chap a\n      little; for while Smythe was ready to show off his monkey tricks anywhere,\n      James Welkin (that was the squinting man\u2019s name) never did anything except\n      soak in our bar parlour, and go for great walks by himself in the flat,\n      grey country all round. All the same, I think Smythe, too, was a little\n      sensitive about being so small, though he carried it off more smartly. And\n      so it was that I was really puzzled, as well as startled, and very sorry,\n      when they both offered to marry me in the same week.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell, I did what I\u2019ve since thought was perhaps a silly thing. But, after\n      all, these freaks were my friends in a way; and I had a horror of their\n      thinking I refused them for the real reason, which was that they were so\n      impossibly ugly. So I made up some gas of another sort, about never\n      meaning to marry anyone who hadn\u2019t carved his way in the world. I said it\n      was a point of principle with me not to live on money that was just\n      inherited like theirs. Two days after I had talked in this well-meaning\n      sort of way, the whole trouble began. The first thing I heard was that\n      both of them had gone off to seek their fortunes, as if they were in some\n      silly fairy tale.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell, I\u2019ve never seen either of them from that day to this. But I\u2019ve had\n      two letters from the little man called Smythe, and really they were rather\n      exciting.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cEver heard of the other man?\u201d asked Angus.\n    \n\n      \u201cNo, he never wrote,\u201d said the girl, after an instant\u2019s hesitation.\n      \u201cSmythe\u2019s first letter was simply to say that he had started out walking\n      with Welkin to London; but Welkin was such a good walker that the little\n      man dropped out of it, and took a rest by the roadside. He happened to be\n      picked up by some travelling show, and, partly because he was nearly a\n      dwarf, and partly because he was really a clever little wretch, he got on\n      quite well in the show business, and was soon sent up to the Aquarium, to\n      do some tricks that I forget. That was his first letter. His second was\n      much more of a startler, and I only got it last week.\u201d\n     \n\n      The man called Angus emptied his coffee-cup and regarded her with mild and\n      patient eyes. Her own mouth took a slight twist of laughter as she\n      resumed, \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve seen on the hoardings all about this \u2018Smythe\u2019s\n      Silent Service\u2019? Or you must be the only person that hasn\u2019t. Oh, I don\u2019t\n      know much about it, it\u2019s some clockwork invention for doing all the\n      housework by machinery. You know the sort of thing: \u2018Press a Button\u2014A\n      Butler who Never Drinks.\u2019 \u2018Turn a Handle\u2014Ten Housemaids who Never\n      Flirt.\u2019 You must have seen the advertisements. Well, whatever these\n      machines are, they are making pots of money; and they are making it all\n      for that little imp whom I knew down in Ludbury. I can\u2019t help feeling\n      pleased the poor little chap has fallen on his feet; but the plain fact\n      is, I\u2019m in terror of his turning up any minute and telling me he\u2019s carved\n      his way in the world\u2014as he certainly has.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAnd the other man?\u201d repeated Angus with a sort of obstinate quietude.\n    \n\n      Laura Hope got to her feet suddenly. \u201cMy friend,\u201d she said, \u201cI think you\n      are a witch. Yes, you are quite right. I have not seen a line of the other\n      man\u2019s writing; and I have no more notion than the dead of what or where he\n      is. But it is of him that I am frightened. It is he who is all about my\n      path. It is he who has half driven me mad. Indeed, I think he has driven\n      me mad; for I have felt him where he could not have been, and I have heard\n      his voice when he could not have spoken.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, my dear,\u201d said the young man, cheerfully, \u201cif he were Satan\n      himself, he is done for now you have told somebody. One goes mad all\n      alone, old girl. But when was it you fancied you felt and heard our\n      squinting friend?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI heard James Welkin laugh as plainly as I hear you speak,\u201d said the\n      girl, steadily. \u201cThere was nobody there, for I stood just outside the shop\n      at the corner, and could see down both streets at once. I had forgotten\n      how he laughed, though his laugh was as odd as his squint. I had not\n      thought of him for nearly a year. But it\u2019s a solemn truth that a few\n      seconds later the first letter came from his rival.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cDid you ever make the spectre speak or squeak, or anything?\u201d asked Angus,\n      with some interest.\n    \n\n      Laura suddenly shuddered, and then said, with an unshaken voice, \u201cYes.\n      Just when I had finished reading the second letter from Isidore Smythe\n      announcing his success. Just then, I heard Welkin say, \u2018He shan\u2019t have\n      you, though.\u2019 It was quite plain, as if he were in the room. It is awful,\n      I think I must be mad.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIf you really were mad,\u201d said the young man, \u201cyou would think you must be\n      sane. But certainly there seems to me to be something a little rum about\n      this unseen gentleman. Two heads are better than one\u2014I spare you\n      allusions to any other organs and really, if you would allow me, as a\n      sturdy, practical man, to bring back the wedding-cake out of the window\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      Even as he spoke, there was a sort of steely shriek in the street outside,\n      and a small motor, driven at devilish speed, shot up to the door of the\n      shop and stuck there. In the same flash of time a small man in a shiny top\n      hat stood stamping in the outer room.\n    \n\n      Angus, who had hitherto maintained hilarious ease from motives of mental\n      hygiene, revealed the strain of his soul by striding abruptly out of the\n      inner room and confronting the new-comer. A glance at him was quite\n      sufficient to confirm the savage guesswork of a man in love. This very\n      dapper but dwarfish figure, with the spike of black beard carried\n      insolently forward, the clever unrestful eyes, the neat but very nervous\n      fingers, could be none other than the man just described to him: Isidore\n      Smythe, who made dolls out of banana skins and match-boxes; Isidore\n      Smythe, who made millions out of undrinking butlers and unflirting\n      housemaids of metal. For a moment the two men, instinctively understanding\n      each other\u2019s air of possession, looked at each other with that curious\n      cold generosity which is the soul of rivalry.\n    \n\n      Mr. Smythe, however, made no allusion to the ultimate ground of their\n      antagonism, but said simply and explosively, \u201cHas Miss Hope seen that\n      thing on the window?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOn the window?\u201d repeated the staring Angus.\n    \n\n      \u201cThere\u2019s no time to explain other things,\u201d said the small millionaire\n      shortly. \u201cThere\u2019s some tomfoolery going on here that has to be\n      investigated.\u201d\n     \n\n      He pointed his polished walking-stick at the window, recently depleted by\n      the bridal preparations of Mr. Angus; and that gentleman was astonished to\n      see along the front of the glass a long strip of paper pasted, which had\n      certainly not been on the window when he looked through it some time\n      before. Following the energetic Smythe outside into the street, he found\n      that some yard and a half of stamp paper had been carefully gummed along\n      the glass outside, and on this was written in straggly characters, \u201cIf you\n      marry Smythe, he will die.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cLaura,\u201d said Angus, putting his big red head into the shop, \u201cyou\u2019re not\n      mad.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIt\u2019s the writing of that fellow Welkin,\u201d said Smythe gruffly. \u201cI haven\u2019t\n      seen him for years, but he\u2019s always bothering me. Five times in the last\n      fortnight he\u2019s had threatening letters left at my flat, and I can\u2019t even\n      find out who leaves them, let alone if it is Welkin himself. The porter of\n      the flats swears that no suspicious characters have been seen, and here he\n      has pasted up a sort of dado on a public shop window, while the people in\n      the shop\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cQuite so,\u201d said Angus modestly, \u201cwhile the people in the shop were having\n      tea. Well, sir, I can assure you I appreciate your common sense in dealing\n      so directly with the matter. We can talk about other things afterwards.\n      The fellow cannot be very far off yet, for I swear there was no paper\n      there when I went last to the window, ten or fifteen minutes ago. On the\n      other hand, he\u2019s too far off to be chased, as we don\u2019t even know the\n      direction. If you\u2019ll take my advice, Mr. Smythe, you\u2019ll put this at once\n      in the hands of some energetic inquiry man, private rather than public. I\n      know an extremely clever fellow, who has set up in business five minutes\n      from here in your car. His name\u2019s Flambeau, and though his youth was a bit\n      stormy, he\u2019s a strictly honest man now, and his brains are worth money. He\n      lives in Lucknow Mansions, Hampstead.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThat is odd,\u201d said the little man, arching his black eyebrows. \u201cI live,\n      myself, in Himylaya Mansions, round the corner. Perhaps you might care to\n      come with me; I can go to my rooms and sort out these queer Welkin\n      documents, while you run round and get your friend the detective.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYou are very good,\u201d said Angus politely. \u201cWell, the sooner we act the\n      better.\u201d\n     \n\n      Both men, with a queer kind of impromptu fairness, took the same sort of\n      formal farewell of the lady, and both jumped into the brisk little car. As\n      Smythe took the handles and they turned the great corner of the street,\n      Angus was amused to see a gigantesque poster of \u201cSmythe\u2019s Silent Service,\u201d\n       with a picture of a huge headless iron doll, carrying a saucepan with the\n      legend, \u201cA Cook Who is Never Cross.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI use them in my own flat,\u201d said the little black-bearded man, laughing,\n      \u201cpartly for advertisements, and partly for real convenience. Honestly, and\n      all above board, those big clockwork dolls of mine do bring your coals or\n      claret or a timetable quicker than any live servants I\u2019ve ever known, if\n      you know which knob to press. But I\u2019ll never deny, between ourselves, that\n      such servants have their disadvantages, too.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIndeed?\u201d said Angus; \u201cis there something they can\u2019t do?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d replied Smythe coolly; \u201cthey can\u2019t tell me who left those\n      threatening letters at my flat.\u201d\n     \n\n      The man\u2019s motor was small and swift like himself; in fact, like his\n      domestic service, it was of his own invention. If he was an advertising\n      quack, he was one who believed in his own wares. The sense of something\n      tiny and flying was accentuated as they swept up long white curves of road\n      in the dead but open daylight of evening. Soon the white curves came\n      sharper and dizzier; they were upon ascending spirals, as they say in the\n      modern religions. For, indeed, they were cresting a corner of London which\n      is almost as precipitous as Edinburgh, if not quite so picturesque.\n      Terrace rose above terrace, and the special tower of flats they sought,\n      rose above them all to almost Egyptian height, gilt by the level sunset.\n      The change, as they turned the corner and entered the crescent known as\n      Himylaya Mansions, was as abrupt as the opening of a window; for they\n      found that pile of flats sitting above London as above a green sea of\n      slate. Opposite to the mansions, on the other side of the gravel crescent,\n      was a bushy enclosure more like a steep hedge or dyke than a garden, and\n      some way below that ran a strip of artificial water, a sort of canal, like\n      the moat of that embowered fortress. As the car swept round the crescent\n      it passed, at one corner, the stray stall of a man selling chestnuts; and\n      right away at the other end of the curve, Angus could see a dim blue\n      policeman walking slowly. These were the only human shapes in that high\n      suburban solitude; but he had an irrational sense that they expressed the\n      speechless poetry of London. He felt as if they were figures in a story.\n    \n\n      The little car shot up to the right house like a bullet, and shot out its\n      owner like a bomb shell. He was immediately inquiring of a tall\n      commissionaire in shining braid, and a short porter in shirt sleeves,\n      whether anybody or anything had been seeking his apartments. He was\n      assured that nobody and nothing had passed these officials since his last\n      inquiries; whereupon he and the slightly bewildered Angus were shot up in\n      the lift like a rocket, till they reached the top floor.\n    \n\n      \u201cJust come in for a minute,\u201d said the breathless Smythe. \u201cI want to show\n      you those Welkin letters. Then you might run round the corner and fetch\n      your friend.\u201d He pressed a button concealed in the wall, and the door\n      opened of itself.\n    \n\n      It opened on a long, commodious ante-room, of which the only arresting\n      features, ordinarily speaking, were the rows of tall half-human mechanical\n      figures that stood up on both sides like tailors\u2019 dummies. Like tailors\u2019 \n      dummies they were headless; and like tailors\u2019 dummies they had a handsome\n      unnecessary humpiness in the shoulders, and a pigeon-breasted protuberance\n      of chest; but barring this, they were not much more like a human figure\n      than any automatic machine at a station that is about the human height.\n      They had two great hooks like arms, for carrying trays; and they were\n      painted pea-green, or vermilion, or black for convenience of distinction;\n      in every other way they were only automatic machines and nobody would have\n      looked twice at them. On this occasion, at least, nobody did. For between\n      the two rows of these domestic dummies lay something more interesting than\n      most of the mechanics of the world. It was a white, tattered scrap of\n      paper scrawled with red ink; and the agile inventor had snatched it up\n      almost as soon as the door flew open. He handed it to Angus without a\n      word. The red ink on it actually was not dry, and the message ran, \u201cIf you\n      have been to see her today, I shall kill you.\u201d\n     \n\n      There was a short silence, and then Isidore Smythe said quietly, \u201cWould\n      you like a little whiskey? I rather feel as if I should.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThank you; I should like a little Flambeau,\u201d said Angus, gloomily. \u201cThis\n      business seems to me to be getting rather grave. I\u2019m going round at once\n      to fetch him.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cRight you are,\u201d said the other, with admirable cheerfulness. \u201cBring him\n      round here as quick as you can.\u201d\n     \n\n      But as Angus closed the front door behind him he saw Smythe push back a\n      button, and one of the clockwork images glided from its place and slid\n      along a groove in the floor carrying a tray with syphon and decanter.\n      There did seem something a trifle weird about leaving the little man alone\n      among those dead servants, who were coming to life as the door closed.\n    \n\n      Six steps down from Smythe\u2019s landing the man in shirt sleeves was doing\n      something with a pail. Angus stopped to extract a promise, fortified with\n      a prospective bribe, that he would remain in that place until the return\n      with the detective, and would keep count of any kind of stranger coming up\n      those stairs. Dashing down to the front hall he then laid similar charges\n      of vigilance on the commissionaire at the front door, from whom he learned\n      the simplifying circumstances that there was no back door. Not content\n      with this, he captured the floating policeman and induced him to stand\n      opposite the entrance and watch it; and finally paused an instant for a\n      pennyworth of chestnuts, and an inquiry as to the probable length of the\n      merchant\u2019s stay in the neighbourhood.\n    \n\n      The chestnut seller, turning up the collar of his coat, told him he should\n      probably be moving shortly, as he thought it was going to snow. Indeed,\n      the evening was growing grey and bitter, but Angus, with all his\n      eloquence, proceeded to nail the chestnut man to his post.\n    \n\n      \u201cKeep yourself warm on your own chestnuts,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cEat up\n      your whole stock; I\u2019ll make it worth your while. I\u2019ll give you a sovereign\n      if you\u2019ll wait here till I come back, and then tell me whether any man,\n      woman, or child has gone into that house where the commissionaire is\n      standing.\u201d\n     \n\n      He then walked away smartly, with a last look at the besieged tower.\n    \n\n      \u201cI\u2019ve made a ring round that room, anyhow,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t all four\n      of them be Mr. Welkin\u2019s accomplices.\u201d\n     \n\n      Lucknow Mansions were, so to speak, on a lower platform of that hill of\n      houses, of which Himylaya Mansions might be called the peak. Mr.\n      Flambeau\u2019s semi-official flat was on the ground floor, and presented in\n      every way a marked contrast to the American machinery and cold hotel-like\n      luxury of the flat of the Silent Service. Flambeau, who was a friend of\n      Angus, received him in a rococo artistic den behind his office, of which\n      the ornaments were sabres, harquebuses, Eastern curiosities, flasks of\n      Italian wine, savage cooking-pots, a plumy Persian cat, and a small\n      dusty-looking Roman Catholic priest, who looked particularly out of place.\n    \n\n      \u201cThis is my friend Father Brown,\u201d said Flambeau. \u201cI\u2019ve often wanted you to\n      meet him. Splendid weather, this; a little cold for Southerners like me.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes, I think it will keep clear,\u201d said Angus, sitting down on a\n      violet-striped Eastern ottoman.\n    \n\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said the priest quietly, \u201cit has begun to snow.\u201d\n     \n\n      And, indeed, as he spoke, the first few flakes, foreseen by the man of\n      chestnuts, began to drift across the darkening windowpane.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell,\u201d said Angus heavily. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve come on business, and rather\n      jumpy business at that. The fact is, Flambeau, within a stone\u2019s throw of\n      your house is a fellow who badly wants your help; he\u2019s perpetually being\n      haunted and threatened by an invisible enemy\u2014a scoundrel whom nobody\n      has even seen.\u201d As Angus proceeded to tell the whole tale of Smythe and\n      Welkin, beginning with Laura\u2019s story, and going on with his own, the\n      supernatural laugh at the corner of two empty streets, the strange\n      distinct words spoken in an empty room, Flambeau grew more and more\n      vividly concerned, and the little priest seemed to be left out of it, like\n      a piece of furniture. When it came to the scribbled stamp-paper pasted on\n      the window, Flambeau rose, seeming to fill the room with his huge\n      shoulders.\n    \n\n      \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, \u201cI think you had better tell me the rest on\n      the nearest road to this man\u2019s house. It strikes me, somehow, that there\n      is no time to be lost.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cDelighted,\u201d said Angus, rising also, \u201cthough he\u2019s safe enough for the\n      present, for I\u2019ve set four men to watch the only hole to his burrow.\u201d\n     \n\n      They turned out into the street, the small priest trundling after them\n      with the docility of a small dog. He merely said, in a cheerful way, like\n      one making conversation, \u201cHow quick the snow gets thick on the ground.\u201d\n     \n\n      As they threaded the steep side streets already powdered with silver,\n      Angus finished his story; and by the time they reached the crescent with\n      the towering flats, he had leisure to turn his attention to the four\n      sentinels. The chestnut seller, both before and after receiving a\n      sovereign, swore stubbornly that he had watched the door and seen no\n      visitor enter. The policeman was even more emphatic. He said he had had\n      experience of crooks of all kinds, in top hats and in rags; he wasn\u2019t so\n      green as to expect suspicious characters to look suspicious; he looked out\n      for anybody, and, so help him, there had been nobody. And when all three\n      men gathered round the gilded commissionaire, who still stood smiling\n      astride of the porch, the verdict was more final still.\n    \n\n      \u201cI\u2019ve got a right to ask any man, duke or dustman, what he wants in these\n      flats,\u201d said the genial and gold-laced giant, \u201cand I\u2019ll swear there\u2019s been\n      nobody to ask since this gentleman went away.\u201d\n     \n\n      The unimportant Father Brown, who stood back, looking modestly at the\n      pavement, here ventured to say meekly, \u201cHas nobody been up and down\n      stairs, then, since the snow began to fall? It began while we were all\n      round at Flambeau\u2019s.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNobody\u2019s been in here, sir, you can take it from me,\u201d said the official,\n      with beaming authority.\n    \n\n      \u201cThen I wonder what that is?\u201d said the priest, and stared at the ground\n      blankly like a fish.\n    \n\n      The others all looked down also; and Flambeau used a fierce exclamation\n      and a French gesture. For it was unquestionably true that down the middle\n      of the entrance guarded by the man in gold lace, actually between the\n      arrogant, stretched legs of that colossus, ran a stringy pattern of grey\n      footprints stamped upon the white snow.\n    \n\n      \u201cGod!\u201d cried Angus involuntarily, \u201cthe Invisible Man!\u201d\n     \n\n      Without another word he turned and dashed up the stairs, with Flambeau\n      following; but Father Brown still stood looking about him in the snow-clad\n      street as if he had lost interest in his query.\n    \n\n      Flambeau was plainly in a mood to break down the door with his big\n      shoulders; but the Scotchman, with more reason, if less intuition, fumbled\n      about on the frame of the door till he found the invisible button; and the\n      door swung slowly open.\n    \n\n      It showed substantially the same serried interior; the hall had grown\n      darker, though it was still struck here and there with the last crimson\n      shafts of sunset, and one or two of the headless machines had been moved\n      from their places for this or that purpose, and stood here and there about\n      the twilit place. The green and red of their coats were all darkened in\n      the dusk; and their likeness to human shapes slightly increased by their\n      very shapelessness. But in the middle of them all, exactly where the paper\n      with the red ink had lain, there lay something that looked like red ink\n      spilt out of its bottle. But it was not red ink.\n    \n\n      With a French combination of reason and violence Flambeau simply said\n      \u201cMurder!\u201d and, plunging into the flat, had explored, every corner and\n      cupboard of it in five minutes. But if he expected to find a corpse he\n      found none. Isidore Smythe was not in the place, either dead or alive.\n      After the most tearing search the two men met each other in the outer\n      hall, with streaming faces and staring eyes. \u201cMy friend,\u201d said Flambeau,\n      talking French in his excitement, \u201cnot only is your murderer invisible,\n      but he makes invisible also the murdered man.\u201d\n     \n\n      Angus looked round at the dim room full of dummies, and in some Celtic\n      corner of his Scotch soul a shudder started. One of the life-size dolls\n      stood immediately overshadowing the blood stain, summoned, perhaps, by the\n      slain man an instant before he fell. One of the high-shouldered hooks that\n      served the thing for arms, was a little lifted, and Angus had suddenly the\n      horrid fancy that poor Smythe\u2019s own iron child had struck him down. Matter\n      had rebelled, and these machines had killed their master. But even so,\n      what had they done with him?\n    \n\n      \u201cEaten him?\u201d said the nightmare at his ear; and he sickened for an instant\n      at the idea of rent, human remains absorbed and crushed into all that\n      acephalous clockwork.\n    \n\n      He recovered his mental health by an emphatic effort, and said to\n      Flambeau, \u201cWell, there it is. The poor fellow has evaporated like a cloud\n      and left a red streak on the floor. The tale does not belong to this\n      world.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThere is only one thing to be done,\u201d said Flambeau, \u201cwhether it belongs\n      to this world or the other. I must go down and talk to my friend.\u201d\n     \n\n      They descended, passing the man with the pail, who again asseverated that\n      he had let no intruder pass, down to the commissionaire and the hovering\n      chestnut man, who rigidly reasserted their own watchfulness. But when\n      Angus looked round for his fourth confirmation he could not see it, and\n      called out with some nervousness, \u201cWhere is the policeman?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Father Brown; \u201cthat is my fault. I just sent him\n      down the road to investigate something\u2014that I just thought worth\n      investigating.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, we want him back pretty soon,\u201d said Angus abruptly, \u201cfor the\n      wretched man upstairs has not only been murdered, but wiped out.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHow?\u201d asked the priest.\n    \n\n      \u201cFather,\u201d said Flambeau, after a pause, \u201cupon my soul I believe it is more\n      in your department than mine. No friend or foe has entered the house, but\n      Smythe is gone, as if stolen by the fairies. If that is not supernatural,\n      I\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      As he spoke they were all checked by an unusual sight; the big blue\n      policeman came round the corner of the crescent, running. He came straight\n      up to Brown.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou\u2019re right, sir,\u201d he panted, \u201cthey\u2019ve just found poor Mr. Smythe\u2019s body\n      in the canal down below.\u201d\n     \n\n      Angus put his hand wildly to his head. \u201cDid he run down and drown\n      himself?\u201d he asked.\n    \n\n      \u201cHe never came down, I\u2019ll swear,\u201d said the constable, \u201cand he wasn\u2019t\n      drowned either, for he died of a great stab over the heart.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAnd yet you saw no one enter?\u201d said Flambeau in a grave voice.\n    \n\n      \u201cLet us walk down the road a little,\u201d said the priest.\n    \n\n      As they reached the other end of the crescent he observed abruptly,\n      \u201cStupid of me! I forgot to ask the policeman something. I wonder if they\n      found a light brown sack.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhy a light brown sack?\u201d asked Angus, astonished.\n    \n\n      \u201cBecause if it was any other coloured sack, the case must begin over\n      again,\u201d said Father Brown; \u201cbut if it was a light brown sack, why, the\n      case is finished.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI am pleased to hear it,\u201d said Angus with hearty irony. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t begun,\n      so far as I am concerned.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYou must tell us all about it,\u201d said Flambeau with a strange heavy\n      simplicity, like a child.\n    \n\n      Unconsciously they were walking with quickening steps down the long sweep\n      of road on the other side of the high crescent, Father Brown leading\n      briskly, though in silence. At last he said with an almost touching\n      vagueness, \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll think it so prosy. We always begin at\n      the abstract end of things, and you can\u2019t begin this story anywhere else.\n    \n\n      \u201cHave you ever noticed this\u2014that people never answer what you say?\n      They answer what you mean\u2014or what they think you mean. Suppose one\n      lady says to another in a country house, \u2018Is anybody staying with you?\u2019 \n      the lady doesn\u2019t answer \u2018Yes; the butler, the three footmen, the\n      parlourmaid, and so on,\u2019 though the parlourmaid may be in the room, or the\n      butler behind her chair. She says \u2018There is nobody staying with us,\u2019 \n      meaning nobody of the sort you mean. But suppose a doctor inquiring into\n      an epidemic asks, \u2018Who is staying in the house?\u2019 then the lady will\n      remember the butler, the parlourmaid, and the rest. All language is used\n      like that; you never get a question answered literally, even when you get\n      it answered truly. When those four quite honest men said that no man had\n      gone into the Mansions, they did not really mean that no man had gone into\n      them. They meant no man whom they could suspect of being your man. A man\n      did go into the house, and did come out of it, but they never noticed\n      him.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAn invisible man?\u201d inquired Angus, raising his red eyebrows. \u201cA mentally\n      invisible man,\u201d said Father Brown.\n    \n\n      A minute or two after he resumed in the same unassuming voice, like a man\n      thinking his way. \u201cOf course you can\u2019t think of such a man, until you do\n      think of him. That\u2019s where his cleverness comes in. But I came to think of\n      him through two or three little things in the tale Mr. Angus told us.\n      First, there was the fact that this Welkin went for long walks. And then\n      there was the vast lot of stamp paper on the window. And then, most of\n      all, there were the two things the young lady said\u2014things that\n      couldn\u2019t be true. Don\u2019t get annoyed,\u201d he added hastily, noting a sudden\n      movement of the Scotchman\u2019s head; \u201cshe thought they were true. A person\n      can\u2019t be quite alone in a street a second before she receives a letter.\n      She can\u2019t be quite alone in a street when she starts reading a letter just\n      received. There must be somebody pretty near her; he must be mentally\n      invisible.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhy must there be somebody near her?\u201d asked Angus.\n    \n\n      \u201cBecause,\u201d said Father Brown, \u201cbarring carrier-pigeons, somebody must have\n      brought her the letter.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cDo you really mean to say,\u201d asked Flambeau, with energy, \u201cthat Welkin\n      carried his rival\u2019s letters to his lady?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said the priest. \u201cWelkin carried his rival\u2019s letters to his lady.\n      You see, he had to.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOh, I can\u2019t stand much more of this,\u201d exploded Flambeau. \u201cWho is this\n      fellow? What does he look like? What is the usual get-up of a mentally\n      invisible man?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHe is dressed rather handsomely in red, blue and gold,\u201d replied the\n      priest promptly with precision, \u201cand in this striking, and even showy,\n      costume he entered Himylaya Mansions under eight human eyes; he killed\n      Smythe in cold blood, and came down into the street again carrying the\n      dead body in his arms\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cReverend sir,\u201d cried Angus, standing still, \u201care you raving mad, or am\n      I?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYou are not mad,\u201d said Brown, \u201conly a little unobservant. You have not\n      noticed such a man as this, for example.\u201d\n     \n\n      He took three quick strides forward, and put his hand on the shoulder of\n      an ordinary passing postman who had bustled by them unnoticed under the\n      shade of the trees.\n    \n\n      \u201cNobody ever notices postmen somehow,\u201d he said thoughtfully; \u201cyet they\n      have passions like other men, and even carry large bags where a small\n      corpse can be stowed quite easily.\u201d\n     \n\n      The postman, instead of turning naturally, had ducked and tumbled against\n      the garden fence. He was a lean fair-bearded man of very ordinary\n      appearance, but as he turned an alarmed face over his shoulder, all three\n      men were fixed with an almost fiendish squint.\n    \n\n      Flambeau went back to his sabres, purple rugs and Persian cat, having many\n      things to attend to. John Turnbull Angus went back to the lady at the\n      shop, with whom that imprudent young man contrives to be extremely\n      comfortable. But Father Brown walked those snow-covered hills under the\n      stars for many hours with a murderer, and what they said to each other\n      will never be known.\n    ",
