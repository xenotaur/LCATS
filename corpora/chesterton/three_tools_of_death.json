    "name": "Chesterton - The Three Tools Of Death",
    "body": "\n      Both by calling and conviction Father Brown knew better than most of us,\n      that every man is dignified when he is dead. But even he felt a pang of\n      incongruity when he was knocked up at daybreak and told that Sir Aaron\n      Armstrong had been murdered. There was something absurd and unseemly about\n      secret violence in connection with so entirely entertaining and popular a\n      figure. For Sir Aaron Armstrong was entertaining to the point of being\n      comic; and popular in such a manner as to be almost legendary. It was like\n      hearing that Sunny Jim had hanged himself; or that Mr. Pickwick had died\n      in Hanwell. For though Sir Aaron was a philanthropist, and thus dealt with\n      the darker side of our society, he prided himself on dealing with it in\n      the brightest possible style. His political and social speeches were\n      cataracts of anecdotes and \u201cloud laughter\u201d; his bodily health was of a\n      bursting sort; his ethics were all optimism; and he dealt with the Drink\n      problem (his favourite topic) with that immortal or even monotonous gaiety\n      which is so often a mark of the prosperous total abstainer.\n    \n\n      The established story of his conversion was familiar on the more puritanic\n      platforms and pulpits, how he had been, when only a boy, drawn away from\n      Scotch theology to Scotch whisky, and how he had risen out of both and\n      become (as he modestly put it) what he was. Yet his wide white beard,\n      cherubic face, and sparkling spectacles, at the numberless dinners and\n      congresses where they appeared, made it hard to believe, somehow, that he\n      had ever been anything so morbid as either a dram-drinker or a Calvinist.\n      He was, one felt, the most seriously merry of all the sons of men.\n    \n\n      He had lived on the rural skirt of Hampstead in a handsome house, high but\n      not broad, a modern and prosaic tower. The narrowest of its narrow sides\n      overhung the steep green bank of a railway, and was shaken by passing\n      trains. Sir Aaron Armstrong, as he boisterously explained, had no nerves.\n      But if the train had often given a shock to the house, that morning the\n      tables were turned, and it was the house that gave a shock to the train.\n    \n\n      The engine slowed down and stopped just beyond that point where an angle\n      of the house impinged upon the sharp slope of turf. The arrest of most\n      mechanical things must be slow; but the living cause of this had been very\n      rapid. A man clad completely in black, even (it was remembered) to the\n      dreadful detail of black gloves, appeared on the ridge above the engine,\n      and waved his black hands like some sable windmill. This in itself would\n      hardly have stopped even a lingering train. But there came out of him a\n      cry which was talked of afterwards as something utterly unnatural and new.\n      It was one of those shouts that are horridly distinct even when we cannot\n      hear what is shouted. The word in this case was \u201cMurder!\u201d\n     \n\n      But the engine-driver swears he would have pulled up just the same if he\n      had heard only the dreadful and definite accent and not the word.\n    \n\n      The train once arrested, the most superficial stare could take in many\n      features of the tragedy. The man in black on the green bank was Sir Aaron\n      Armstrong\u2019s man-servant Magnus. The baronet in his optimism had often\n      laughed at the black gloves of this dismal attendant; but no one was\n      likely to laugh at him just now.\n    \n\n      So soon as an inquirer or two had stepped off the line and across the\n      smoky hedge, they saw, rolled down almost to the bottom of the bank, the\n      body of an old man in a yellow dressing-gown with a very vivid scarlet\n      lining. A scrap of rope seemed caught about his leg, entangled presumably\n      in a struggle. There was a smear or so of blood, though very little; but\n      the body was bent or broken into a posture impossible to any living thing.\n      It was Sir Aaron Armstrong. A few more bewildered moments brought out a\n      big fair-bearded man, whom some travellers could salute as the dead man\u2019s\n      secretary, Patrick Royce, once well known in Bohemian society and even\n      famous in the Bohemian arts. In a manner more vague, but even more\n      convincing, he echoed the agony of the servant. By the time the third\n      figure of that household, Alice Armstrong, daughter of the dead man, had\n      come already tottering and waving into the garden, the engine-driver had\n      put a stop to his stoppage. The whistle had blown and the train had panted\n      on to get help from the next station.\n    \n\n      Father Brown had been thus rapidly summoned at the request of Patrick\n      Royce, the big ex-Bohemian secretary. Royce was an Irishman by birth; and\n      that casual kind of Catholic that never remembers his religion until he is\n      really in a hole. But Royce\u2019s request might have been less promptly\n      complied with if one of the official detectives had not been a friend and\n      admirer of the unofficial Flambeau; and it was impossible to be a friend\n      of Flambeau without hearing numberless stories about Father Brown. Hence,\n      while the young detective (whose name was Merton) led the little priest\n      across the fields to the railway, their talk was more confidential than\n      could be expected between two total strangers.\n    \n\n      \u201cAs far as I can see,\u201d said Mr. Merton candidly, \u201cthere is no sense to be\n      made of it at all. There is nobody one can suspect. Magnus is a solemn old\n      fool; far too much of a fool to be an assassin. Royce has been the\n      baronet\u2019s best friend for years; and his daughter undoubtedly adored him.\n      Besides, it\u2019s all too absurd. Who would kill such a cheery old chap as\n      Armstrong? Who could dip his hands in the gore of an after-dinner speaker?\n      It would be like killing Father Christmas.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes, it was a cheery house,\u201d assented Father Brown. \u201cIt was a cheery\n      house while he was alive. Do you think it will be cheery now he is dead?\u201d\n     \n\n      Merton started a little and regarded his companion with an enlivened eye.\n      \u201cNow he is dead?\u201d he repeated.\n    \n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d continued the priest stolidly, \u201che was cheerful. But did he\n      communicate his cheerfulness? Frankly, was anyone else in the house\n      cheerful but he?\u201d\n     \n\n      A window in Merton\u2019s mind let in that strange light of surprise in which\n      we see for the first time things we have known all along. He had often\n      been to the Armstrongs\u2019, on little police jobs of the philanthropist; and,\n      now he came to think of it, it was in itself a depressing house. The rooms\n      were very high and very cold; the decoration mean and provincial; the\n      draughty corridors were lit by electricity that was bleaker than\n      moonlight. And though the old man\u2019s scarlet face and silver beard had\n      blazed like a bonfire in each room or passage in turn, it did not leave\n      any warmth behind it. Doubtless this spectral discomfort in the place was\n      partly due to the very vitality and exuberance of its owner; he needed no\n      stoves or lamps, he would say, but carried his own warmth with him. But\n      when Merton recalled the other inmates, he was compelled to confess that\n      they also were as shadows of their lord. The moody man-servant, with his\n      monstrous black gloves, was almost a nightmare; Royce, the secretary, was\n      solid enough, a big bull of a man, in tweeds, with a short beard; but the\n      straw-coloured beard was startlingly salted with grey like the tweeds, and\n      the broad forehead was barred with premature wrinkles. He was good-natured\n      enough also, but it was a sad sort of good-nature, almost a heart-broken\n      sort\u2014he had the general air of being some sort of failure in life.\n      As for Armstrong\u2019s daughter, it was almost incredible that she was his\n      daughter; she was so pallid in colour and sensitive in outline. She was\n      graceful, but there was a quiver in the very shape of her that was like\n      the lines of an aspen. Merton had sometimes wondered if she had learnt to\n      quail at the crash of the passing trains.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou see,\u201d said Father Brown, blinking modestly, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the\n      Armstrong cheerfulness is so very cheerful\u2014for other people. You say\n      that nobody could kill such a happy old man, but I\u2019m not sure; ne nos\n      inducas in tentationem. If ever I murdered somebody,\u201d he added quite\n      simply, \u201cI dare say it might be an Optimist.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhy?\u201d cried Merton amused. \u201cDo you think people dislike cheerfulness?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cPeople like frequent laughter,\u201d answered Father Brown, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think\n      they like a permanent smile. Cheerfulness without humour is a very trying\n      thing.\u201d\n     \n\n      They walked some way in silence along the windy grassy bank by the rail,\n      and just as they came under the far-flung shadow of the tall Armstrong\n      house, Father Brown said suddenly, like a man throwing away a troublesome\n      thought rather than offering it seriously: \u201cOf course, drink is neither\n      good nor bad in itself. But I can\u2019t help sometimes feeling that men like\n      Armstrong want an occasional glass of wine to sadden them.\u201d\n     \n\n      Merton\u2019s official superior, a grizzled and capable detective named Gilder,\n      was standing on the green bank waiting for the coroner, talking to Patrick\n      Royce, whose big shoulders and bristly beard and hair towered above him.\n      This was the more noticeable because Royce walked always with a sort of\n      powerful stoop, and seemed to be going about his small clerical and\n      domestic duties in a heavy and humbled style, like a buffalo drawing a\n      go-cart.\n    \n\n      He raised his head with unusual pleasure at the sight of the priest, and\n      took him a few paces apart. Meanwhile Merton was addressing the older\n      detective respectfully indeed, but not without a certain boyish\n      impatience.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell, Mr. Gilder, have you got much farther with the mystery?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThere is no mystery,\u201d replied Gilder, as he looked under dreamy eyelids\n      at the rooks.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell, there is for me, at any rate,\u201d said Merton, smiling.\n    \n\n      \u201cIt is simple enough, my boy,\u201d observed the senior investigator, stroking\n      his grey, pointed beard. \u201cThree minutes after you\u2019d gone for Mr. Royce\u2019s\n      parson the whole thing came out. You know that pasty-faced servant in the\n      black gloves who stopped the train?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI should know him anywhere. Somehow he rather gave me the creeps.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell,\u201d drawled Gilder, \u201cwhen the train had gone on again, that man had\n      gone too. Rather a cool criminal, don\u2019t you think, to escape by the very\n      train that went off for the police?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYou\u2019re pretty sure, I suppose,\u201d remarked the young man, \u201cthat he really\n      did kill his master?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes, my son, I\u2019m pretty sure,\u201d replied Gilder drily, \u201cfor the trifling\n      reason that he has gone off with twenty thousand pounds in papers that\n      were in his master\u2019s desk. No, the only thing worth calling a difficulty\n      is how he killed him. The skull seems broken as with some big weapon, but\n      there\u2019s no weapon at all lying about, and the murderer would have found it\n      awkward to carry it away, unless the weapon was too small to be noticed.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cPerhaps the weapon was too big to be noticed,\u201d said the priest, with an\n      odd little giggle.\n    \n\n      Gilder looked round at this wild remark, and rather sternly asked Brown\n      what he meant.\n    \n\n      \u201cSilly way of putting it, I know,\u201d said Father Brown apologetically.\n      \u201cSounds like a fairy tale. But poor Armstrong was killed with a giant\u2019s\n      club, a great green club, too big to be seen, and which we call the earth.\n      He was broken against this green bank we are standing on.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d asked the detective quickly.\n    \n\n      Father Brown turned his moon face up to the narrow fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the house and\n      blinked hopelessly up. Following his eyes, they saw that right at the top\n      of this otherwise blind back quarter of the building, an attic window\n      stood open.\n    \n\n      \u201cDon\u2019t you see,\u201d he explained, pointing a little awkwardly like a child,\n      \u201che was thrown down from there?\u201d\n     \n\n      Gilder frowningly scrutinised the window, and then said: \u201cWell, it is\n      certainly possible. But I don\u2019t see why you are so sure about it.\u201d\n     \n\n      Brown opened his grey eyes wide. \u201cWhy,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a bit of rope\n      round the dead man\u2019s leg. Don\u2019t you see that other bit of rope up there\n      caught at the corner of the window?\u201d\n     \n\n      At that height the thing looked like the faintest particle of dust or\n      hair, but the shrewd old investigator was satisfied. \u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\n      sir,\u201d he said to Father Brown; \u201cthat is certainly one to you.\u201d\n     \n\n      Almost as he spoke a special train with one carriage took the curve of the\n      line on their left, and, stopping, disgorged another group of policemen,\n      in whose midst was the hangdog visage of Magnus, the absconded servant.\n    \n\n      \u201cBy Jove! they\u2019ve got him,\u201d cried Gilder, and stepped forward with quite a\n      new alertness.\n    \n\n      \u201cHave you got the money!\u201d he cried to the first policeman.\n    \n\n      The man looked him in the face with a rather curious expression and said:\n      \u201cNo.\u201d Then he added: \u201cAt least, not here.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhich is the inspector, please?\u201d asked the man called Magnus.\n    \n\n      When he spoke everyone instantly understood how this voice had stopped a\n      train. He was a dull-looking man with flat black hair, a colourless face,\n      and a faint suggestion of the East in the level slits in his eyes and\n      mouth. His blood and name, indeed, had remained dubious, ever since Sir\n      Aaron had \u201crescued\u201d him from a waitership in a London restaurant, and (as\n      some said) from more infamous things. But his voice was as vivid as his\n      face was dead. Whether through exactitude in a foreign language, or in\n      deference to his master (who had been somewhat deaf), Magnus\u2019s tones had a\n      peculiarly ringing and piercing quality, and the whole group quite jumped\n      when he spoke.\n    \n\n      \u201cI always knew this would happen,\u201d he said aloud with brazen blandness.\n      \u201cMy poor old master made game of me for wearing black; but I always said I\n      should be ready for his funeral.\u201d\n     \n\n      And he made a momentary movement with his two dark-gloved hands.\n    \n\n      \u201cSergeant,\u201d said Inspector Gilder, eyeing the black hands with wrath,\n      \u201caren\u2019t you putting the bracelets on this fellow; he looks pretty\n      dangerous.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said the sergeant, with the same odd look of wonder, \u201cI don\u2019t\n      know that we can.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked the other sharply. \u201cHaven\u2019t you arrested him?\u201d\n     \n\n      A faint scorn widened the slit-like mouth, and the whistle of an\n      approaching train seemed oddly to echo the mockery.\n    \n\n      \u201cWe arrested him,\u201d replied the sergeant gravely, \u201cjust as he was coming\n      out of the police station at Highgate, where he had deposited all his\n      master\u2019s money in the care of Inspector Robinson.\u201d\n     \n\n      Gilder looked at the man-servant in utter amazement. \u201cWhy on earth did you\n      do that?\u201d he asked of Magnus.\n    \n\n      \u201cTo keep it safe from the criminal, of course,\u201d replied that person\n      placidly.\n    \n\n      \u201cSurely,\u201d said Gilder, \u201cSir Aaron\u2019s money might have been safely left with\n      Sir Aaron\u2019s family.\u201d\n     \n\n      The tail of his sentence was drowned in the roar of the train as it went\n      rocking and clanking; but through all the hell of noises to which that\n      unhappy house was periodically subject, they could hear the syllables of\n      Magnus\u2019s answer, in all their bell-like distinctness: \u201cI have no reason to\n      feel confidence in Sir Aaron\u2019s family.\u201d\n     \n\n      All the motionless men had the ghostly sensation of the presence of some\n      new person; and Merton was scarcely surprised when he looked up and saw\n      the pale face of Armstrong\u2019s daughter over Father Brown\u2019s shoulder. She\n      was still young and beautiful in a silvery style, but her hair was of so\n      dusty and hueless a brown that in some shadows it seemed to have turned\n      totally grey.\n    \n\n      \u201cBe careful what you say,\u201d said Royce gruffly, \u201cyou\u2019ll frighten Miss\n      Armstrong.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI hope so,\u201d said the man with the clear voice.\n    \n\n      As the woman winced and everyone else wondered, he went on: \u201cI am somewhat\n      used to Miss Armstrong\u2019s tremors. I have seen her trembling off and on for\n      years. And some said she was shaking with cold and some she was shaking\n      with fear, but I know she was shaking with hate and wicked anger\u2014fiends\n      that have had their feast this morning. She would have been away by now\n      with her lover and all the money but for me. Ever since my poor old master\n      prevented her from marrying that tipsy blackguard\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cStop,\u201d said Gilder very sternly. \u201cWe have nothing to do with your family\n      fancies or suspicions. Unless you have some practical evidence, your mere\n      opinions\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cOh! I\u2019ll give you practical evidence,\u201d cut in Magnus, in his hacking\n      accent. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to subpoena me, Mr. Inspector, and I shall have to\n      tell the truth. And the truth is this: An instant after the old man was\n      pitched bleeding out of the window, I ran into the attic, and found his\n      daughter swooning on the floor with a red dagger still in her hand. Allow\n      me to hand that also to the proper authorities.\u201d He took from his\n      tail-pocket a long horn-hilted knife with a red smear on it, and handed it\n      politely to the sergeant. Then he stood back again, and his slits of eyes\n      almost faded from his face in one fat Chinese sneer.\n    \n\n      Merton felt an almost bodily sickness at the sight of him; and he muttered\n      to Gilder: \u201cSurely you would take Miss Armstrong\u2019s word against his?\u201d\n     \n\n      Father Brown suddenly lifted a face so absurdly fresh that it looked\n      somehow as if he had just washed it. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, radiating innocence,\n      \u201cbut is Miss Armstrong\u2019s word against his?\u201d\n     \n\n      The girl uttered a startled, singular little cry; everyone looked at her.\n      Her figure was rigid as if paralysed; only her face within its frame of\n      faint brown hair was alive with an appalling surprise. She stood like one\n      of a sudden lassooed and throttled.\n    \n\n      \u201cThis man,\u201d said Mr. Gilder gravely, \u201cactually says that you were found\n      grasping a knife, insensible, after the murder.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHe says the truth,\u201d answered Alice.\n    \n\n      The next fact of which they were conscious was that Patrick Royce strode\n      with his great stooping head into their ring and uttered the singular\n      words: \u201cWell, if I\u2019ve got to go, I\u2019ll have a bit of pleasure first.\u201d\n     \n\n      His huge shoulder heaved and he sent an iron fist smash into Magnus\u2019s\n      bland Mongolian visage, laying him on the lawn as flat as a starfish. Two\n      or three of the police instantly put their hands on Royce; but to the rest\n      it seemed as if all reason had broken up and the universe were turning\n      into a brainless harlequinade.\n    \n\n      \u201cNone of that, Mr. Royce,\u201d Gilder had called out authoritatively. \u201cI shall\n      arrest you for assault.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d answered the secretary in a voice like an iron gong, \u201cyou\n      will arrest me for murder.\u201d\n     \n\n      Gilder threw an alarmed glance at the man knocked down; but since that\n      outraged person was already sitting up and wiping a little blood off a\n      substantially uninjured face, he only said shortly: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIt is quite true, as this fellow says,\u201d explained Royce, \u201cthat Miss\n      Armstrong fainted with a knife in her hand. But she had not snatched the\n      knife to attack her father, but to defend him.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cTo defend him,\u201d repeated Gilder gravely. \u201cAgainst whom?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAgainst me,\u201d answered the secretary.\n    \n\n      Alice looked at him with a complex and baffling face; then she said in a\n      low voice: \u201cAfter it all, I am still glad you are brave.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cCome upstairs,\u201d said Patrick Royce heavily, \u201cand I will show you the\n      whole cursed thing.\u201d\n     \n\n      The attic, which was the secretary\u2019s private place (and rather a small\n      cell for so large a hermit), had indeed all the vestiges of a violent\n      drama. Near the centre of the floor lay a large revolver as if flung away;\n      nearer to the left was rolled a whisky bottle, open but not quite empty.\n      The cloth of the little table lay dragged and trampled, and a length of\n      cord, like that found on the corpse, was cast wildly across the\n      windowsill. Two vases were smashed on the mantelpiece and one on the\n      carpet.\n    \n\n      \u201cI was drunk,\u201d said Royce; and this simplicity in the prematurely battered\n      man somehow had the pathos of the first sin of a baby.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou all know about me,\u201d he continued huskily; \u201ceverybody knows how my\n      story began, and it may as well end like that too. I was called a clever\n      man once, and might have been a happy one; Armstrong saved the remains of\n      a brain and body from the taverns, and was always kind to me in his own\n      way, poor fellow! Only he wouldn\u2019t let me marry Alice here; and it will\n      always be said that he was right enough. Well, you can form your own\n      conclusions, and you won\u2019t want me to go into details. That is my whisky\n      bottle half emptied in the corner; that is my revolver quite emptied on\n      the carpet. It was the rope from my box that was found on the corpse, and\n      it was from my window the corpse was thrown. You need not set detectives\n      to grub up my tragedy; it is a common enough weed in this world. I give\n      myself to the gallows; and, by God, that is enough!\u201d\n     \n\n      At a sufficiently delicate sign, the police gathered round the large man\n      to lead him away; but their unobtrusiveness was somewhat staggered by the\n      remarkable appearance of Father Brown, who was on his hands and knees on\n      the carpet in the doorway, as if engaged in some kind of undignified\n      prayers. Being a person utterly insensible to the social figure he cut, he\n      remained in this posture, but turned a bright round face up at the\n      company, presenting the appearance of a quadruped with a very comic human\n      head.\n    \n\n      \u201cI say,\u201d he said good-naturedly, \u201cthis really won\u2019t do at all, you know.\n      At the beginning you said we\u2019d found no weapon. But now we\u2019re finding too\n      many; there\u2019s the knife to stab, and the rope to strangle, and the pistol\n      to shoot; and after all he broke his neck by falling out of a window! It\n      won\u2019t do. It\u2019s not economical.\u201d And he shook his head at the ground as a\n      horse does grazing.\n    \n\n      Inspector Gilder had opened his mouth with serious intentions, but before\n      he could speak the grotesque figure on the floor had gone on quite\n      volubly.\n    \n\n      \u201cAnd now three quite impossible things. First, these holes in the carpet,\n      where the six bullets have gone in. Why on earth should anybody fire at\n      the carpet? A drunken man lets fly at his enemy\u2019s head, the thing that\u2019s\n      grinning at him. He doesn\u2019t pick a quarrel with his feet, or lay siege to\n      his slippers. And then there\u2019s the rope\u201d\u2014and having done with the\n      carpet the speaker lifted his hands and put them in his pocket, but\n      continued unaffectedly on his knees\u2014\u201cin what conceivable\n      intoxication would anybody try to put a rope round a man\u2019s neck and\n      finally put it round his leg? Royce, anyhow, was not so drunk as that, or\n      he would be sleeping like a log by now. And, plainest of all, the whisky\n      bottle. You suggest a dipsomaniac fought for the whisky bottle, and then\n      having won, rolled it away in a corner, spilling one half and leaving the\n      other. That is the very last thing a dipsomaniac would do.\u201d\n     \n\n      He scrambled awkwardly to his feet, and said to the self-accused murderer\n      in tones of limpid penitence: \u201cI\u2019m awfully sorry, my dear sir, but your\n      tale is really rubbish.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cSir,\u201d said Alice Armstrong in a low tone to the priest, \u201ccan I speak to\n      you alone for a moment?\u201d\n     \n\n      This request forced the communicative cleric out of the gangway, and\n      before he could speak in the next room, the girl was talking with strange\n      incisiveness.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou are a clever man,\u201d she said, \u201cand you are trying to save Patrick, I\n      know. But it\u2019s no use. The core of all this is black, and the more things\n      you find out the more there will be against the miserable man I love.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Brown, looking at her steadily.\n    \n\n      \u201cBecause,\u201d she answered equally steadily, \u201cI saw him commit the crime\n      myself.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAh!\u201d said the unmoved Brown, \u201cand what did he do?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI was in this room next to them,\u201d she explained; \u201cboth doors were closed,\n      but I suddenly heard a voice, such as I had never heard on earth, roaring\n      \u2018Hell, hell, hell,\u2019 again and again, and then the two doors shook with the\n      first explosion of the revolver. Thrice again the thing banged before I\n      got the two doors open and found the room full of smoke; but the pistol\n      was smoking in my poor, mad Patrick\u2019s hand; and I saw him fire the last\n      murderous volley with my own eyes. Then he leapt on my father, who was\n      clinging in terror to the window-sill, and, grappling, tried to strangle\n      him with the rope, which he threw over his head, but which slipped over\n      his struggling shoulders to his feet. Then it tightened round one leg and\n      Patrick dragged him along like a maniac. I snatched a knife from the mat,\n      and, rushing between them, managed to cut the rope before I fainted.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI see,\u201d said Father Brown, with the same wooden civility. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n     \n\n      As the girl collapsed under her memories, the priest passed stiffly into\n      the next room, where he found Gilder and Merton alone with Patrick Royce,\n      who sat in a chair, handcuffed. There he said to the Inspector\n      submissively:\n    \n\n      \u201cMight I say a word to the prisoner in your presence; and might he take\n      off those funny cuffs for a minute?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHe is a very powerful man,\u201d said Merton in an undertone. \u201cWhy do you want\n      them taken off?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhy, I thought,\u201d replied the priest humbly, \u201cthat perhaps I might have\n      the very great honour of shaking hands with him.\u201d\n     \n\n      Both detectives stared, and Father Brown added: \u201cWon\u2019t you tell them about\n      it, sir?\u201d\n     \n\n      The man on the chair shook his tousled head, and the priest turned\n      impatiently.\n    \n\n      \u201cThen I will,\u201d he said. \u201cPrivate lives are more important than public\n      reputations. I am going to save the living, and let the dead bury their\n      dead.\u201d\n     \n\n      He went to the fatal window, and blinked out of it as he went on talking.\n    \n\n      \u201cI told you that in this case there were too many weapons and only one\n      death. I tell you now that they were not weapons, and were not used to\n      cause death. All those grisly tools, the noose, the bloody knife, the\n      exploding pistol, were instruments of a curious mercy. They were not used\n      to kill Sir Aaron, but to save him.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cTo save him!\u201d repeated Gilder. \u201cAnd from what?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cFrom himself,\u201d said Father Brown. \u201cHe was a suicidal maniac.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhat?\u201d cried Merton in an incredulous tone. \u201cAnd the Religion of\n      Cheerfulness\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIt is a cruel religion,\u201d said the priest, looking out of the window. \u201cWhy\n      couldn\u2019t they let him weep a little, like his fathers before him? His\n      plans stiffened, his views grew cold; behind that merry mask was the empty\n      mind of the atheist. At last, to keep up his hilarious public level, he\n      fell back on that dram-drinking he had abandoned long ago. But there is\n      this horror about alcoholism in a sincere teetotaler: that he pictures and\n      expects that psychological inferno from which he has warned others. It\n      leapt upon poor Armstrong prematurely, and by this morning he was in such\n      a case that he sat here and cried he was in hell, in so crazy a voice that\n      his daughter did not know it. He was mad for death, and with the monkey\n      tricks of the mad he had scattered round him death in many shapes\u2014a\n      running noose and his friend\u2019s revolver and a knife. Royce entered\n      accidentally and acted in a flash. He flung the knife on the mat behind\n      him, snatched up the revolver, and having no time to unload it, emptied it\n      shot after shot all over the floor. The suicide saw a fourth shape of\n      death, and made a dash for the window. The rescuer did the only thing he\n      could\u2014ran after him with the rope and tried to tie him hand and\n      foot. Then it was that the unlucky girl ran in, and misunderstanding the\n      struggle, strove to slash her father free. At first she only slashed poor\n      Royce\u2019s knuckles, from which has come all the little blood in this affair.\n      But, of course, you noticed that he left blood, but no wound, on that\n      servant\u2019s face? Only before the poor woman swooned, she did hack her\n      father loose, so that he went crashing through that window into eternity.\u201d\n     \n\n      There was a long stillness slowly broken by the metallic noises of Gilder\n      unlocking the handcuffs of Patrick Royce, to whom he said: \u201cI think I\n      should have told the truth, sir. You and the young lady are worth more\n      than Armstrong\u2019s obituary notices.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cConfound Armstrong\u2019s notices,\u201d cried Royce roughly. \u201cDon\u2019t you see it was\n      because she mustn\u2019t know?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cMustn\u2019t know what?\u201d asked Merton.\n    \n\n      \u201cWhy, that she killed her father, you fool!\u201d roared the other. \u201cHe\u2019d have\n      been alive now but for her. It might craze her to know that.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it would,\u201d remarked Father Brown, as he picked up his\n      hat. \u201cI rather think I should tell her. Even the most murderous blunders\n      don\u2019t poison life like sins; anyhow, I think you may both be the happier\n      now. I\u2019ve got to go back to the Deaf School.\u201d\n     \n\n      As he went out on to the gusty grass an acquaintance from Highgate stopped\n      him and said:\n    \n\n      \u201cThe Coroner has arrived. The inquiry is just going to begin.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to the Deaf School,\u201d said Father Brown. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\n      can\u2019t stop for the inquiry.\u201d\n     ",
