    "name": "Chesterton - The Secret Garden",
    "body": "\n      Aristide Valentin, Chief of the Paris Police, was late for his dinner, and\n      some of his guests began to arrive before him. These were, however,\n      reassured by his confidential servant, Ivan, the old man with a scar, and\n      a face almost as grey as his moustaches, who always sat at a table in the\n      entrance hall\u2014a hall hung with weapons. Valentin\u2019s house was perhaps\n      as peculiar and celebrated as its master. It was an old house, with high\n      walls and tall poplars almost overhanging the Seine; but the oddity\u2014and\n      perhaps the police value\u2014of its architecture was this: that there\n      was no ultimate exit at all except through this front door, which was\n      guarded by Ivan and the armoury. The garden was large and elaborate, and\n      there were many exits from the house into the garden. But there was no\n      exit from the garden into the world outside; all round it ran a tall,\n      smooth, unscalable wall with special spikes at the top; no bad garden,\n      perhaps, for a man to reflect in whom some hundred criminals had sworn to\n      kill.\n    \n\n      As Ivan explained to the guests, their host had telephoned that he was\n      detained for ten minutes. He was, in truth, making some last arrangements\n      about executions and such ugly things; and though these duties were\n      rootedly repulsive to him, he always performed them with precision.\n      Ruthless in the pursuit of criminals, he was very mild about their\n      punishment. Since he had been supreme over French\u2014and largely over\n      European\u2014policial methods, his great influence had been honourably\n      used for the mitigation of sentences and the purification of prisons. He\n      was one of the great humanitarian French freethinkers; and the only thing\n      wrong with them is that they make mercy even colder than justice.\n    \n\n      When Valentin arrived he was already dressed in black clothes and the red\n      rosette\u2014an elegant figure, his dark beard already streaked with\n      grey. He went straight through his house to his study, which opened on the\n      grounds behind. The garden door of it was open, and after he had carefully\n      locked his box in its official place, he stood for a few seconds at the\n      open door looking out upon the garden. A sharp moon was fighting with the\n      flying rags and tatters of a storm, and Valentin regarded it with a\n      wistfulness unusual in such scientific natures as his. Perhaps such\n      scientific natures have some psychic prevision of the most tremendous\n      problem of their lives. From any such occult mood, at least, he quickly\n      recovered, for he knew he was late, and that his guests had already begun\n      to arrive. A glance at his drawing-room when he entered it was enough to\n      make certain that his principal guest was not there, at any rate. He saw\n      all the other pillars of the little party; he saw Lord Galloway, the\n      English Ambassador\u2014a choleric old man with a russet face like an\n      apple, wearing the blue ribbon of the Garter. He saw Lady Galloway, slim\n      and threadlike, with silver hair and a face sensitive and superior. He saw\n      her daughter, Lady Margaret Graham, a pale and pretty girl with an elfish\n      face and copper-coloured hair. He saw the Duchess of Mont St. Michel,\n      black-eyed and opulent, and with her her two daughters, black-eyed and\n      opulent also. He saw Dr. Simon, a typical French scientist, with glasses,\n      a pointed brown beard, and a forehead barred with those parallel wrinkles\n      which are the penalty of superciliousness, since they come through\n      constantly elevating the eyebrows. He saw Father Brown, of Cobhole, in\n      Essex, whom he had recently met in England. He saw\u2014perhaps with more\n      interest than any of these\u2014a tall man in uniform, who had bowed to\n      the Galloways without receiving any very hearty acknowledgment, and who\n      now advanced alone to pay his respects to his host. This was Commandant\n      O\u2019Brien, of the French Foreign Legion. He was a slim yet somewhat\n      swaggering figure, clean-shaven, dark-haired, and blue-eyed, and, as\n      seemed natural in an officer of that famous regiment of victorious\n      failures and successful suicides, he had an air at once dashing and\n      melancholy. He was by birth an Irish gentleman, and in boyhood had known\n      the Galloways\u2014especially Margaret Graham. He had left his country\n      after some crash of debts, and now expressed his complete freedom from\n      British etiquette by swinging about in uniform, sabre and spurs. When he\n      bowed to the Ambassador\u2019s family, Lord and Lady Galloway bent stiffly, and\n      Lady Margaret looked away.\n    \n\n      But for whatever old causes such people might be interested in each other,\n      their distinguished host was not specially interested in them. No one of\n      them at least was in his eyes the guest of the evening. Valentin was\n      expecting, for special reasons, a man of world-wide fame, whose friendship\n      he had secured during some of his great detective tours and triumphs in\n      the United States. He was expecting Julius K. Brayne, that\n      multi-millionaire whose colossal and even crushing endowments of small\n      religions have occasioned so much easy sport and easier solemnity for the\n      American and English papers. Nobody could quite make out whether Mr.\n      Brayne was an atheist or a Mormon or a Christian Scientist; but he was\n      ready to pour money into any intellectual vessel, so long as it was an\n      untried vessel. One of his hobbies was to wait for the American\n      Shakespeare\u2014a hobby more patient than angling. He admired Walt\n      Whitman, but thought that Luke P. Tanner, of Paris, Pa., was more\n      \u201cprogressive\u201d than Whitman any day. He liked anything that he thought\n      \u201cprogressive.\u201d He thought Valentin \u201cprogressive,\u201d thereby doing him a\n      grave injustice.\n    \n\n      The solid appearance of Julius K. Brayne in the room was as decisive as a\n      dinner bell. He had this great quality, which very few of us can claim,\n      that his presence was as big as his absence. He was a huge fellow, as fat\n      as he was tall, clad in complete evening black, without so much relief as\n      a watch-chain or a ring. His hair was white and well brushed back like a\n      German\u2019s; his face was red, fierce and cherubic, with one dark tuft under\n      the lower lip that threw up that otherwise infantile visage with an effect\n      theatrical and even Mephistophelean. Not long, however, did that salon\n      merely stare at the celebrated American; his lateness had already become a\n      domestic problem, and he was sent with all speed into the dining-room with\n      Lady Galloway on his arm.\n    \n\n      Except on one point the Galloways were genial and casual enough. So long\n      as Lady Margaret did not take the arm of that adventurer O\u2019Brien, her\n      father was quite satisfied; and she had not done so, she had decorously\n      gone in with Dr. Simon. Nevertheless, old Lord Galloway was restless and\n      almost rude. He was diplomatic enough during dinner, but when, over the\n      cigars, three of the younger men\u2014Simon the doctor, Brown the priest,\n      and the detrimental O\u2019Brien, the exile in a foreign uniform\u2014all\n      melted away to mix with the ladies or smoke in the conservatory, then the\n      English diplomatist grew very undiplomatic indeed. He was stung every\n      sixty seconds with the thought that the scamp O\u2019Brien might be signalling\n      to Margaret somehow; he did not attempt to imagine how. He was left over\n      the coffee with Brayne, the hoary Yankee who believed in all religions,\n      and Valentin, the grizzled Frenchman who believed in none. They could\n      argue with each other, but neither could appeal to him. After a time this\n      \u201cprogressive\u201d logomachy had reached a crisis of tedium; Lord Galloway got\n      up also and sought the drawing-room. He lost his way in long passages for\n      some six or eight minutes: till he heard the high-pitched, didactic voice\n      of the doctor, and then the dull voice of the priest, followed by general\n      laughter. They also, he thought with a curse, were probably arguing about\n      \u201cscience and religion.\u201d But the instant he opened the salon door he saw\n      only one thing\u2014he saw what was not there. He saw that Commandant\n      O\u2019Brien was absent, and that Lady Margaret was absent too.\n    \n\n      Rising impatiently from the drawing-room, as he had from the dining-room,\n      he stamped along the passage once more. His notion of protecting his\n      daughter from the Irish-Algerian n\u2019er-do-well had become something central\n      and even mad in his mind. As he went towards the back of the house, where\n      was Valentin\u2019s study, he was surprised to meet his daughter, who swept\n      past with a white, scornful face, which was a second enigma. If she had\n      been with O\u2019Brien, where was O\u2019Brien! If she had not been with O\u2019Brien,\n      where had she been? With a sort of senile and passionate suspicion he\n      groped his way to the dark back parts of the mansion, and eventually found\n      a servants\u2019 entrance that opened on to the garden. The moon with her\n      scimitar had now ripped up and rolled away all the storm-wrack. The argent\n      light lit up all four corners of the garden. A tall figure in blue was\n      striding across the lawn towards the study door; a glint of moonlit silver\n      on his facings picked him out as Commandant O\u2019Brien.\n    \n\n      He vanished through the French windows into the house, leaving Lord\n      Galloway in an indescribable temper, at once virulent and vague. The\n      blue-and-silver garden, like a scene in a theatre, seemed to taunt him\n      with all that tyrannic tenderness against which his worldly authority was\n      at war. The length and grace of the Irishman\u2019s stride enraged him as if he\n      were a rival instead of a father; the moonlight maddened him. He was\n      trapped as if by magic into a garden of troubadours, a Watteau fairyland;\n      and, willing to shake off such amorous imbecilities by speech, he stepped\n      briskly after his enemy. As he did so he tripped over some tree or stone\n      in the grass; looked down at it first with irritation and then a second\n      time with curiosity. The next instant the moon and the tall poplars looked\n      at an unusual sight\u2014an elderly English diplomatist running hard and\n      crying or bellowing as he ran.\n    \n\n      His hoarse shouts brought a pale face to the study door, the beaming\n      glasses and worried brow of Dr. Simon, who heard the nobleman\u2019s first\n      clear words. Lord Galloway was crying: \u201cA corpse in the grass\u2014a\n      blood-stained corpse.\u201d O\u2019Brien at last had gone utterly out of his mind.\n    \n\n      \u201cWe must tell Valentin at once,\u201d said the doctor, when the other had\n      brokenly described all that he had dared to examine. \u201cIt is fortunate that\n      he is here;\u201d and even as he spoke the great detective entered the study,\n      attracted by the cry. It was almost amusing to note his typical\n      transformation; he had come with the common concern of a host and a\n      gentleman, fearing that some guest or servant was ill. When he was told\n      the gory fact, he turned with all his gravity instantly bright and\n      businesslike; for this, however abrupt and awful, was his business.\n    \n\n      \u201cStrange, gentlemen,\u201d he said as they hurried out into the garden, \u201cthat I\n      should have hunted mysteries all over the earth, and now one comes and\n      settles in my own back-yard. But where is the place?\u201d They crossed the\n      lawn less easily, as a slight mist had begun to rise from the river; but\n      under the guidance of the shaken Galloway they found the body sunken in\n      deep grass\u2014the body of a very tall and broad-shouldered man. He lay\n      face downwards, so they could only see that his big shoulders were clad in\n      black cloth, and that his big head was bald, except for a wisp or two of\n      brown hair that clung to his skull like wet seaweed. A scarlet serpent of\n      blood crawled from under his fallen face.\n    \n\n      \u201cAt least,\u201d said Simon, with a deep and singular intonation, \u201che is none\n      of our party.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cExamine him, doctor,\u201d cried Valentin rather sharply. \u201cHe may not be\n      dead.\u201d\n     \n\n      The doctor bent down. \u201cHe is not quite cold, but I am afraid he is dead\n      enough,\u201d he answered. \u201cJust help me to lift him up.\u201d\n     \n\n      They lifted him carefully an inch from the ground, and all doubts as to\n      his being really dead were settled at once and frightfully. The head fell\n      away. It had been entirely sundered from the body; whoever had cut his\n      throat had managed to sever the neck as well. Even Valentin was slightly\n      shocked. \u201cHe must have been as strong as a gorilla,\u201d he muttered.\n    \n\n      Not without a shiver, though he was used to anatomical abortions, Dr.\n      Simon lifted the head. It was slightly slashed about the neck and jaw, but\n      the face was substantially unhurt. It was a ponderous, yellow face, at\n      once sunken and swollen, with a hawk-like nose and heavy lids\u2014a face\n      of a wicked Roman emperor, with, perhaps, a distant touch of a Chinese\n      emperor. All present seemed to look at it with the coldest eye of\n      ignorance. Nothing else could be noted about the man except that, as they\n      had lifted his body, they had seen underneath it the white gleam of a\n      shirt-front defaced with a red gleam of blood. As Dr. Simon said, the man\n      had never been of their party. But he might very well have been trying to\n      join it, for he had come dressed for such an occasion.\n    \n\n      Valentin went down on his hands and knees and examined with his closest\n      professional attention the grass and ground for some twenty yards round\n      the body, in which he was assisted less skillfully by the doctor, and\n      quite vaguely by the English lord. Nothing rewarded their grovellings\n      except a few twigs, snapped or chopped into very small lengths, which\n      Valentin lifted for an instant\u2019s examination and then tossed away.\n    \n\n      \u201cTwigs,\u201d he said gravely; \u201ctwigs, and a total stranger with his head cut\n      off; that is all there is on this lawn.\u201d\n     \n\n      There was an almost creepy stillness, and then the unnerved Galloway\n      called out sharply:\n    \n\n      \u201cWho\u2019s that! Who\u2019s that over there by the garden wall!\u201d\n     \n\n      A small figure with a foolishly large head drew waveringly near them in\n      the moonlit haze; looked for an instant like a goblin, but turned out to\n      be the harmless little priest whom they had left in the drawing-room.\n    \n\n      \u201cI say,\u201d he said meekly, \u201cthere are no gates to this garden, do you know.\u201d\n     \n\n      Valentin\u2019s black brows had come together somewhat crossly, as they did on\n      principle at the sight of the cassock. But he was far too just a man to\n      deny the relevance of the remark. \u201cYou are right,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore we\n      find out how he came to be killed, we may have to find out how he came to\n      be here. Now listen to me, gentlemen. If it can be done without prejudice\n      to my position and duty, we shall all agree that certain distinguished\n      names might well be kept out of this. There are ladies, gentlemen, and\n      there is a foreign ambassador. If we must mark it down as a crime, then it\n      must be followed up as a crime. But till then I can use my own discretion.\n      I am the head of the police; I am so public that I can afford to be\n      private. Please Heaven, I will clear everyone of my own guests before I\n      call in my men to look for anybody else. Gentlemen, upon your honour, you\n      will none of you leave the house till tomorrow at noon; there are bedrooms\n      for all. Simon, I think you know where to find my man, Ivan, in the front\n      hall; he is a confidential man. Tell him to leave another servant on guard\n      and come to me at once. Lord Galloway, you are certainly the best person\n      to tell the ladies what has happened, and prevent a panic. They also must\n      stay. Father Brown and I will remain with the body.\u201d\n     \n\n      When this spirit of the captain spoke in Valentin he was obeyed like a\n      bugle. Dr. Simon went through to the armoury and routed out Ivan, the\n      public detective\u2019s private detective. Galloway went to the drawing-room\n      and told the terrible news tactfully enough, so that by the time the\n      company assembled there the ladies were already startled and already\n      soothed. Meanwhile the good priest and the good atheist stood at the head\n      and foot of the dead man motionless in the moonlight, like symbolic\n      statues of their two philosophies of death.\n    \n\n      Ivan, the confidential man with the scar and the moustaches, came out of\n      the house like a cannon ball, and came racing across the lawn to Valentin\n      like a dog to his master. His livid face was quite lively with the glow of\n      this domestic detective story, and it was with almost unpleasant eagerness\n      that he asked his master\u2019s permission to examine the remains.\n    \n\n      \u201cYes; look, if you like, Ivan,\u201d said Valentin, \u201cbut don\u2019t be long. We must\n      go in and thrash this out in the house.\u201d\n     \n\n      Ivan lifted the head, and then almost let it drop.\n    \n\n      \u201cWhy,\u201d he gasped, \u201cit\u2019s\u2014no, it isn\u2019t; it can\u2019t be. Do you know this\n      man, sir?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said Valentin indifferently; \u201cwe had better go inside.\u201d\n     \n\n      Between them they carried the corpse to a sofa in the study, and then all\n      made their way to the drawing-room.\n    \n\n      The detective sat down at a desk quietly, and even without hesitation; but\n      his eye was the iron eye of a judge at assize. He made a few rapid notes\n      upon paper in front of him, and then said shortly: \u201cIs everybody here?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNot Mr. Brayne,\u201d said the Duchess of Mont St. Michel, looking round.\n    \n\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said Lord Galloway in a hoarse, harsh voice. \u201cAnd not Mr. Neil\n      O\u2019Brien, I fancy. I saw that gentleman walking in the garden when the\n      corpse was still warm.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIvan,\u201d said the detective, \u201cgo and fetch Commandant O\u2019Brien and Mr.\n      Brayne. Mr. Brayne, I know, is finishing a cigar in the dining-room;\n      Commandant O\u2019Brien, I think, is walking up and down the conservatory. I am\n      not sure.\u201d\n     \n\n      The faithful attendant flashed from the room, and before anyone could stir\n      or speak Valentin went on with the same soldierly swiftness of exposition.\n    \n\n      \u201cEveryone here knows that a dead man has been found in the garden, his\n      head cut clean from his body. Dr. Simon, you have examined it. Do you\n      think that to cut a man\u2019s throat like that would need great force? Or,\n      perhaps, only a very sharp knife?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI should say that it could not be done with a knife at all,\u201d said the\n      pale doctor.\n    \n\n      \u201cHave you any thought,\u201d resumed Valentin, \u201cof a tool with which it could\n      be done?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cSpeaking within modern probabilities, I really haven\u2019t,\u201d said the doctor,\n      arching his painful brows. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to hack a neck through even\n      clumsily, and this was a very clean cut. It could be done with a\n      battle-axe or an old headsman\u2019s axe, or an old two-handed sword.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cBut, good heavens!\u201d cried the Duchess, almost in hysterics, \u201cthere aren\u2019t\n      any two-handed swords and battle-axes round here.\u201d\n     \n\n      Valentin was still busy with the paper in front of him. \u201cTell me,\u201d he\n      said, still writing rapidly, \u201ccould it have been done with a long French\n      cavalry sabre?\u201d\n     \n\n      A low knocking came at the door, which, for some unreasonable reason,\n      curdled everyone\u2019s blood like the knocking in Macbeth. Amid that frozen\n      silence Dr. Simon managed to say: \u201cA sabre\u2014yes, I suppose it could.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThank you,\u201d said Valentin. \u201cCome in, Ivan.\u201d\n     \n\n      The confidential Ivan opened the door and ushered in Commandant Neil\n      O\u2019Brien, whom he had found at last pacing the garden again.\n    \n\n      The Irish officer stood up disordered and defiant on the threshold. \u201cWhat\n      do you want with me?\u201d he cried.\n    \n\n      \u201cPlease sit down,\u201d said Valentin in pleasant, level tones. \u201cWhy, you\n      aren\u2019t wearing your sword. Where is it?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI left it on the library table,\u201d said O\u2019Brien, his brogue deepening in\n      his disturbed mood. \u201cIt was a nuisance, it was getting\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIvan,\u201d said Valentin, \u201cplease go and get the Commandant\u2019s sword from the\n      library.\u201d Then, as the servant vanished, \u201cLord Galloway says he saw you\n      leaving the garden just before he found the corpse. What were you doing in\n      the garden?\u201d\n     \n\n      The Commandant flung himself recklessly into a chair. \u201cOh,\u201d he cried in\n      pure Irish, \u201cadmirin\u2019 the moon. Communing with Nature, me bhoy.\u201d\n     \n\n      A heavy silence sank and endured, and at the end of it came again that\n      trivial and terrible knocking. Ivan reappeared, carrying an empty steel\n      scabbard. \u201cThis is all I can find,\u201d he said.\n    \n\n      \u201cPut it on the table,\u201d said Valentin, without looking up.\n    \n\n      There was an inhuman silence in the room, like that sea of inhuman silence\n      round the dock of the condemned murderer. The Duchess\u2019s weak exclamations\n      had long ago died away. Lord Galloway\u2019s swollen hatred was satisfied and\n      even sobered. The voice that came was quite unexpected.\n    \n\n      \u201cI think I can tell you,\u201d cried Lady Margaret, in that clear, quivering\n      voice with which a courageous woman speaks publicly. \u201cI can tell you what\n      Mr. O\u2019Brien was doing in the garden, since he is bound to silence. He was\n      asking me to marry him. I refused; I said in my family circumstances I\n      could give him nothing but my respect. He was a little angry at that; he\n      did not seem to think much of my respect. I wonder,\u201d she added, with\n      rather a wan smile, \u201cif he will care at all for it now. For I offer it him\n      now. I will swear anywhere that he never did a thing like this.\u201d\n     \n\n      Lord Galloway had edged up to his daughter, and was intimidating her in\n      what he imagined to be an undertone. \u201cHold your tongue, Maggie,\u201d he said\n      in a thunderous whisper. \u201cWhy should you shield the fellow? Where\u2019s his\n      sword? Where\u2019s his confounded cavalry\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      He stopped because of the singular stare with which his daughter was\n      regarding him, a look that was indeed a lurid magnet for the whole group.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou old fool!\u201d she said in a low voice without pretence of piety, \u201cwhat\n      do you suppose you are trying to prove? I tell you this man was innocent\n      while with me. But if he wasn\u2019t innocent, he was still with me. If he\n      murdered a man in the garden, who was it who must have seen\u2014who must\n      at least have known? Do you hate Neil so much as to put your own daughter\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      Lady Galloway screamed. Everyone else sat tingling at the touch of those\n      satanic tragedies that have been between lovers before now. They saw the\n      proud, white face of the Scotch aristocrat and her lover, the Irish\n      adventurer, like old portraits in a dark house. The long silence was full\n      of formless historical memories of murdered husbands and poisonous\n      paramours.\n    \n\n      In the centre of this morbid silence an innocent voice said: \u201cWas it a\n      very long cigar?\u201d\n     \n\n      The change of thought was so sharp that they had to look round to see who\n      had spoken.\n    \n\n      \u201cI mean,\u201d said little Father Brown, from the corner of the room, \u201cI mean\n      that cigar Mr. Brayne is finishing. It seems nearly as long as a\n      walking-stick.\u201d\n     \n\n      Despite the irrelevance there was assent as well as irritation in\n      Valentin\u2019s face as he lifted his head.\n    \n\n      \u201cQuite right,\u201d he remarked sharply. \u201cIvan, go and see about Mr. Brayne\n      again, and bring him here at once.\u201d\n     \n\n      The instant the factotum had closed the door, Valentin addressed the girl\n      with an entirely new earnestness.\n    \n\n      \u201cLady Margaret,\u201d he said, \u201cwe all feel, I am sure, both gratitude and\n      admiration for your act in rising above your lower dignity and explaining\n      the Commandant\u2019s conduct. But there is a hiatus still. Lord Galloway, I\n      understand, met you passing from the study to the drawing-room, and it was\n      only some minutes afterwards that he found the garden and the Commandant\n      still walking there.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYou have to remember,\u201d replied Margaret, with a faint irony in her voice,\n      \u201cthat I had just refused him, so we should scarcely have come back arm in\n      arm. He is a gentleman, anyhow; and he loitered behind\u2014and so got\n      charged with murder.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIn those few moments,\u201d said Valentin gravely, \u201che might really\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      The knock came again, and Ivan put in his scarred face.\n    \n\n      \u201cBeg pardon, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Mr. Brayne has left the house.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cLeft!\u201d cried Valentin, and rose for the first time to his feet.\n    \n\n      \u201cGone. Scooted. Evaporated,\u201d replied Ivan in humorous French. \u201cHis hat and\n      coat are gone, too, and I\u2019ll tell you something to cap it all. I ran\n      outside the house to find any traces of him, and I found one, and a big\n      trace, too.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Valentin.\n    \n\n      \u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d said his servant, and reappeared with a flashing naked\n      cavalry sabre, streaked with blood about the point and edge. Everyone in\n      the room eyed it as if it were a thunderbolt; but the experienced Ivan\n      went on quite quietly:\n    \n\n      \u201cI found this,\u201d he said, \u201cflung among the bushes fifty yards up the road\n      to Paris. In other words, I found it just where your respectable Mr.\n      Brayne threw it when he ran away.\u201d\n     \n\n      There was again a silence, but of a new sort. Valentin took the sabre,\n      examined it, reflected with unaffected concentration of thought, and then\n      turned a respectful face to O\u2019Brien. \u201cCommandant,\u201d he said, \u201cwe trust you\n      will always produce this weapon if it is wanted for police examination.\n      Meanwhile,\u201d he added, slapping the steel back in the ringing scabbard,\n      \u201clet me return you your sword.\u201d\n     \n\n      At the military symbolism of the action the audience could hardly refrain\n      from applause.\n    \n\n      For Neil O\u2019Brien, indeed, that gesture was the turning-point of existence.\n      By the time he was wandering in the mysterious garden again in the colours\n      of the morning the tragic futility of his ordinary mien had fallen from\n      him; he was a man with many reasons for happiness. Lord Galloway was a\n      gentleman, and had offered him an apology. Lady Margaret was something\n      better than a lady, a woman at least, and had perhaps given him something\n      better than an apology, as they drifted among the old flowerbeds before\n      breakfast. The whole company was more lighthearted and humane, for though\n      the riddle of the death remained, the load of suspicion was lifted off\n      them all, and sent flying off to Paris with the strange millionaire\u2014a\n      man they hardly knew. The devil was cast out of the house\u2014he had\n      cast himself out.\n    \n\n      Still, the riddle remained; and when O\u2019Brien threw himself on a garden\n      seat beside Dr. Simon, that keenly scientific person at once resumed it.\n      He did not get much talk out of O\u2019Brien, whose thoughts were on pleasanter\n      things.\n    \n\n      \u201cI can\u2019t say it interests me much,\u201d said the Irishman frankly, \u201cespecially\n      as it seems pretty plain now. Apparently Brayne hated this stranger for\n      some reason; lured him into the garden, and killed him with my sword. Then\n      he fled to the city, tossing the sword away as he went. By the way, Ivan\n      tells me the dead man had a Yankee dollar in his pocket. So he was a\n      countryman of Brayne\u2019s, and that seems to clinch it. I don\u2019t see any\n      difficulties about the business.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThere are five colossal difficulties,\u201d said the doctor quietly; \u201clike\n      high walls within walls. Don\u2019t mistake me. I don\u2019t doubt that Brayne did\n      it; his flight, I fancy, proves that. But as to how he did it. First\n      difficulty: Why should a man kill another man with a great hulking sabre,\n      when he can almost kill him with a pocket knife and put it back in his\n      pocket? Second difficulty: Why was there no noise or outcry? Does a man\n      commonly see another come up waving a scimitar and offer no remarks? Third\n      difficulty: A servant watched the front door all the evening; and a rat\n      cannot get into Valentin\u2019s garden anywhere. How did the dead man get into\n      the garden? Fourth difficulty: Given the same conditions, how did Brayne\n      get out of the garden?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cAnd the fifth,\u201d said Neil, with eyes fixed on the English priest who was\n      coming slowly up the path.\n    \n\n      \u201cIs a trifle, I suppose,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cbut I think an odd one. When I\n      first saw how the head had been slashed, I supposed the assassin had\n      struck more than once. But on examination I found many cuts across the\n      truncated section; in other words, they were struck after the head was\n      off. Did Brayne hate his foe so fiendishly that he stood sabring his body\n      in the moonlight?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHorrible!\u201d said O\u2019Brien, and shuddered.\n    \n\n      The little priest, Brown, had arrived while they were talking, and had\n      waited, with characteristic shyness, till they had finished. Then he said\n      awkwardly:\n    \n\n      \u201cI say, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt. But I was sent to tell you the news!\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNews?\u201d repeated Simon, and stared at him rather painfully through his\n      glasses.\n    \n\n      \u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Father Brown mildly. \u201cThere\u2019s been another murder,\n      you know.\u201d\n     \n\n      Both men on the seat sprang up, leaving it rocking.\n    \n\n      \u201cAnd, what\u2019s stranger still,\u201d continued the priest, with his dull eye on\n      the rhododendrons, \u201cit\u2019s the same disgusting sort; it\u2019s another beheading.\n      They found the second head actually bleeding into the river, a few yards\n      along Brayne\u2019s road to Paris; so they suppose that he\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cGreat Heaven!\u201d cried O\u2019Brien. \u201cIs Brayne a monomaniac?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cThere are American vendettas,\u201d said the priest impassively. Then he\n      added: \u201cThey want you to come to the library and see it.\u201d\n     \n\n      Commandant O\u2019Brien followed the others towards the inquest, feeling\n      decidedly sick. As a soldier, he loathed all this secretive carnage;\n      where were these extravagant amputations going to stop? First one head\n      was hacked off, and then another; in this case (he told himself bitterly)\n      it was not true that two heads were better than one. As he crossed the\n      study he almost staggered at a shocking coincidence. Upon\n      Valentin\u2019s table lay the coloured picture of yet a third bleeding\n      head; and it was the head of Valentin himself. A second glance showed him\n      it was only a Nationalist paper, called The Guillotine, which\n      every week showed one of its political opponents with rolling eyes and\n      writhing features just after execution; for Valentin was an anti-clerical\n      of some note. But O\u2019Brien was an Irishman, with a kind of chastity\n      even in his sins; and his gorge rose against that great brutality of the\n      intellect which belongs only to France. He felt Paris as a whole, from\n      the grotesques on the Gothic churches to the gross caricatures in the\n      newspapers. He remembered the gigantic jests of the Revolution. He saw\n      the whole city as one ugly energy, from the sanguinary sketch lying on\n      Valentin\u2019s table up to where, above a mountain and forest of\n      gargoyles, the great devil grins on Notre Dame.\n    \n\n      The library was long, low, and dark; what light entered it shot from under\n      low blinds and had still some of the ruddy tinge of morning. Valentin and\n      his servant Ivan were waiting for them at the upper end of a long,\n      slightly-sloping desk, on which lay the mortal remains, looking enormous\n      in the twilight. The big black figure and yellow face of the man found in\n      the garden confronted them essentially unchanged. The second head, which\n      had been fished from among the river reeds that morning, lay streaming and\n      dripping beside it; Valentin\u2019s men were still seeking to recover the rest\n      of this second corpse, which was supposed to be afloat. Father Brown, who\n      did not seem to share O\u2019Brien\u2019s sensibilities in the least, went up to the\n      second head and examined it with his blinking care. It was little more\n      than a mop of wet white hair, fringed with silver fire in the red and\n      level morning light; the face, which seemed of an ugly, empurpled and\n      perhaps criminal type, had been much battered against trees or stones as\n      it tossed in the water.\n    \n\n      \u201cGood morning, Commandant O\u2019Brien,\u201d said Valentin, with quiet cordiality.\n      \u201cYou have heard of Brayne\u2019s last experiment in butchery, I suppose?\u201d\n     \n\n      Father Brown was still bending over the head with white hair, and he said,\n      without looking up:\n    \n\n      \u201cI suppose it is quite certain that Brayne cut off this head, too.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell, it seems common sense,\u201d said Valentin, with his hands in his\n      pockets. \u201cKilled in the same way as the other. Found within a few yards of\n      the other. And sliced by the same weapon which we know he carried away.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes, yes; I know,\u201d replied Father Brown submissively. \u201cYet, you know, I\n      doubt whether Brayne could have cut off this head.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhy not?\u201d inquired Dr. Simon, with a rational stare.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell, doctor,\u201d said the priest, looking up blinking, \u201ccan a man cut off\n      his own head? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n     \n\n      O\u2019Brien felt an insane universe crashing about his ears; but the doctor\n      sprang forward with impetuous practicality and pushed back the wet white\n      hair.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh, there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s Brayne,\u201d said the priest quietly. \u201cHe had\n      exactly that chip in the left ear.\u201d\n     \n\n      The detective, who had been regarding the priest with steady and\n      glittering eyes, opened his clenched mouth and said sharply: \u201cYou seem to\n      know a lot about him, Father Brown.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI do,\u201d said the little man simply. \u201cI\u2019ve been about with him for some\n      weeks. He was thinking of joining our church.\u201d\n     \n\n      The star of the fanatic sprang into Valentin\u2019s eyes; he strode towards the\n      priest with clenched hands. \u201cAnd, perhaps,\u201d he cried, with a blasting\n      sneer, \u201cperhaps he was also thinking of leaving all his money to your\n      church.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cPerhaps he was,\u201d said Brown stolidly; \u201cit is possible.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIn that case,\u201d cried Valentin, with a dreadful smile, \u201cyou may indeed\n      know a great deal about him. About his life and about his\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      Commandant O\u2019Brien laid a hand on Valentin\u2019s arm. \u201cDrop that slanderous\n      rubbish, Valentin,\u201d he said, \u201cor there may be more swords yet.\u201d\n     \n\n      But Valentin (under the steady, humble gaze of the priest) had already\n      recovered himself. \u201cWell,\u201d he said shortly, \u201cpeople\u2019s private opinions can\n      wait. You gentlemen are still bound by your promise to stay; you must\n      enforce it on yourselves\u2014and on each other. Ivan here will tell you\n      anything more you want to know; I must get to business and write to the\n      authorities. We can\u2019t keep this quiet any longer. I shall be writing in my\n      study if there is any more news.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIs there any more news, Ivan?\u201d asked Dr. Simon, as the chief of police\n      strode out of the room.\n    \n\n      \u201cOnly one more thing, I think, sir,\u201d said Ivan, wrinkling up his grey old\n      face, \u201cbut that\u2019s important, too, in its way. There\u2019s that old buffer you\n      found on the lawn,\u201d and he pointed without pretence of reverence at the\n      big black body with the yellow head. \u201cWe\u2019ve found out who he is, anyhow.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cIndeed!\u201d cried the astonished doctor, \u201cand who is he?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHis name was Arnold Becker,\u201d said the under-detective, \u201cthough he went by\n      many aliases. He was a wandering sort of scamp, and is known to have been\n      in America; so that was where Brayne got his knife into him. We didn\u2019t\n      have much to do with him ourselves, for he worked mostly in Germany. We\u2019ve\n      communicated, of course, with the German police. But, oddly enough, there\n      was a twin brother of his, named Louis Becker, whom we had a great deal to\n      do with. In fact, we found it necessary to guillotine him only yesterday.\n      Well, it\u2019s a rum thing, gentlemen, but when I saw that fellow flat on the\n      lawn I had the greatest jump of my life. If I hadn\u2019t seen Louis Becker\n      guillotined with my own eyes, I\u2019d have sworn it was Louis Becker lying\n      there in the grass. Then, of course, I remembered his twin brother in\n      Germany, and following up the clue\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      The explanatory Ivan stopped, for the excellent reason that nobody was\n      listening to him. The Commandant and the doctor were both staring at\n      Father Brown, who had sprung stiffly to his feet, and was holding his\n      temples tight like a man in sudden and violent pain.\n    \n\n      \u201cStop, stop, stop!\u201d he cried; \u201cstop talking a minute, for I see half. Will\n      God give me strength? Will my brain make the one jump and see all? Heaven\n      help me! I used to be fairly good at thinking. I could paraphrase any page\n      in Aquinas once. Will my head split\u2014or will it see? I see half\u2014I\n      only see half.\u201d\n     \n\n      He buried his head in his hands, and stood in a sort of rigid torture of\n      thought or prayer, while the other three could only go on staring at this\n      last prodigy of their wild twelve hours.\n    \n\n      When Father Brown\u2019s hands fell they showed a face quite fresh and serious,\n      like a child\u2019s. He heaved a huge sigh, and said: \u201cLet us get this said and\n      done with as quickly as possible. Look here, this will be the quickest way\n      to convince you all of the truth.\u201d He turned to the doctor. \u201cDr. Simon,\u201d\n       he said, \u201cyou have a strong head-piece, and I heard you this morning\n      asking the five hardest questions about this business. Well, if you will\n      ask them again, I will answer them.\u201d\n     \n\n      Simon\u2019s pince-nez dropped from his nose in his doubt and wonder, but he\n      answered at once. \u201cWell, the first question, you know, is why a man should\n      kill another with a clumsy sabre at all when a man can kill with a\n      bodkin?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cA man cannot behead with a bodkin,\u201d said Brown calmly, \u201cand for this\n      murder beheading was absolutely necessary.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhy?\u201d asked O\u2019Brien, with interest.\n    \n\n      \u201cAnd the next question?\u201d asked Father Brown.\n    \n\n      \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t the man cry out or anything?\u201d asked the doctor; \u201csabres\n      in gardens are certainly unusual.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cTwigs,\u201d said the priest gloomily, and turned to the window which looked\n      on the scene of death. \u201cNo one saw the point of the twigs. Why should they\n      lie on that lawn (look at it) so far from any tree? They were not snapped\n      off; they were chopped off. The murderer occupied his enemy with some\n      tricks with the sabre, showing how he could cut a branch in mid-air, or\n      what-not. Then, while his enemy bent down to see the result, a silent\n      slash, and the head fell.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor slowly, \u201cthat seems plausible enough. But my next\n      two questions will stump anyone.\u201d\n     \n\n      The priest still stood looking critically out of the window and waited.\n    \n\n      \u201cYou know how all the garden was sealed up like an air-tight chamber,\u201d\n       went on the doctor. \u201cWell, how did the strange man get into the garden?\u201d\n     \n\n      Without turning round, the little priest answered: \u201cThere never was any\n      strange man in the garden.\u201d\n     \n\n      There was a silence, and then a sudden cackle of almost childish laughter\n      relieved the strain. The absurdity of Brown\u2019s remark moved Ivan to open\n      taunts.\n    \n\n      \u201cOh!\u201d he cried; \u201cthen we didn\u2019t lug a great fat corpse on to a sofa last\n      night? He hadn\u2019t got into the garden, I suppose?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cGot into the garden?\u201d repeated Brown reflectively. \u201cNo, not entirely.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHang it all,\u201d cried Simon, \u201ca man gets into a garden, or he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d said the priest, with a faint smile. \u201cWhat is the nest\n      question, doctor?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cI fancy you\u2019re ill,\u201d exclaimed Dr. Simon sharply; \u201cbut I\u2019ll ask the next\n      question if you like. How did Brayne get out of the garden?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cHe didn\u2019t get out of the garden,\u201d said the priest, still looking out of\n      the window.\n    \n\n      \u201cDidn\u2019t get out of the garden?\u201d exploded Simon.\n    \n\n      \u201cNot completely,\u201d said Father Brown.\n    \n\n      Simon shook his fists in a frenzy of French logic. \u201cA man gets out of a\n      garden, or he doesn\u2019t,\u201d he cried.\n    \n\n      \u201cNot always,\u201d said Father Brown.\n    \n\n      Dr. Simon sprang to his feet impatiently. \u201cI have no time to spare on such\n      senseless talk,\u201d he cried angrily. \u201cIf you can\u2019t understand a man being on\n      one side of a wall or the other, I won\u2019t trouble you further.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cDoctor,\u201d said the cleric very gently, \u201cwe have always got on very\n      pleasantly together. If only for the sake of old friendship, stop and tell\n      me your fifth question.\u201d\n     \n\n      The impatient Simon sank into a chair by the door and said briefly: \u201cThe\n      head and shoulders were cut about in a queer way. It seemed to be done\n      after death.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said the motionless priest, \u201cit was done so as to make you assume\n      exactly the one simple falsehood that you did assume. It was done to make\n      you take for granted that the head belonged to the body.\u201d\n     \n\n      The borderland of the brain, where all the monsters are made, moved\n      horribly in the Gaelic O\u2019Brien. He felt the chaotic presence of all the\n      horse-men and fish-women that man\u2019s unnatural fancy has begotten. A voice\n      older than his first fathers seemed saying in his ear: \u201cKeep out of the\n      monstrous garden where grows the tree with double fruit. Avoid the evil\n      garden where died the man with two heads.\u201d Yet, while these shameful\n      symbolic shapes passed across the ancient mirror of his Irish soul, his\n      Frenchified intellect was quite alert, and was watching the odd priest as\n      closely and incredulously as all the rest.\n    \n\n      Father Brown had turned round at last, and stood against the window, with\n      his face in dense shadow; but even in that shadow they could see it was\n      pale as ashes. Nevertheless, he spoke quite sensibly, as if there were no\n      Gaelic souls on earth.\n    \n\n      \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, \u201cyou did not find the strange body of Becker in the\n      garden. You did not find any strange body in the garden. In face of Dr.\n      Simon\u2019s rationalism, I still affirm that Becker was only partly present.\n      Look here!\u201d (pointing to the black bulk of the mysterious corpse) \u201cyou\n      never saw that man in your lives. Did you ever see this man?\u201d\n     \n\n      He rapidly rolled away the bald, yellow head of the unknown, and put in\n      its place the white-maned head beside it. And there, complete, unified,\n      unmistakable, lay Julius K. Brayne.\n    \n\n      \u201cThe murderer,\u201d went on Brown quietly, \u201chacked off his enemy\u2019s head and\n      flung the sword far over the wall. But he was too clever to fling the\n      sword only. He flung the head over the wall also. Then he had only to clap\n      on another head to the corpse, and (as he insisted on a private inquest)\n      you all imagined a totally new man.\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cClap on another head!\u201d said O\u2019Brien staring. \u201cWhat other head? Heads\n      don\u2019t grow on garden bushes, do they?\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said Father Brown huskily, and looking at his boots;\n      \u201cthere is only one place where they grow. They grow in the basket\n      of the guillotine, beside which the chief of police, Aristide Valentin,\n      was standing not an hour before the murder. Oh, my friends, hear me a\n      minute more before you tear me in pieces. Valentin is an honest man, if\n      being mad for an arguable cause is honesty. But did you never see in that\n      cold, grey eye of his that he is mad! He would do anything, anything, to\n      break what he calls the superstition of the Cross. He has fought for it\n      and starved for it, and now he has murdered for it. Brayne\u2019s crazy\n      millions had hitherto been scattered among so many sects that they did\n      little to alter the balance of things. But Valentin heard a whisper that\n      Brayne, like so many scatter-brained sceptics, was drifting to us; and\n      that was quite a different thing. Brayne would pour supplies into the\n      impoverished and pugnacious Church of France; he would support six\n      Nationalist newspapers like The Guillotine. The battle was already\n      balanced on a point, and the fanatic took flame at the risk. He resolved\n      to destroy the millionaire, and he did it as one would expect the\n      greatest of detectives to commit his only crime. He abstracted the\n      severed head of Becker on some criminological excuse, and took it home in\n      his official box. He had that last argument with Brayne, that Lord\n      Galloway did not hear the end of; that failing, he led him out into the\n      sealed garden, talked about swordsmanship, used twigs and a sabre for\n      illustration, and\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      Ivan of the Scar sprang up. \u201cYou lunatic,\u201d he yelled; \u201cyou\u2019ll go to my\n      master now, if I take you by\u2014\u201d\n     \n\n      \u201cWhy, I was going there,\u201d said Brown heavily; \u201cI must ask him to confess,\n      and all that.\u201d\n     \n\n      Driving the unhappy Brown before them like a hostage or sacrifice, they\n      rushed together into the sudden stillness of Valentin\u2019s study.\n    \n\n      The great detective sat at his desk apparently too occupied to hear their\n      turbulent entrance. They paused a moment, and then something in the look\n      of that upright and elegant back made the doctor run forward suddenly. A\n      touch and a glance showed him that there was a small box of pills at\n      Valentin\u2019s elbow, and that Valentin was dead in his chair; and on the\n      blind face of the suicide was more than the pride of Cato.\n    ",
