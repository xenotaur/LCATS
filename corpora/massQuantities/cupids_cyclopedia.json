It seems to us the\nmost important branch of co-education._\n\n_How few of us know how to make love properly, and how very few, after\nmaking it, know how to keep it!_\n\n_So much depends upon the kind of love which is made. There are no\nartificial methods of preserving love, but the best kind will keep\nforever. Few beginners know how to make the lasting kind, and many, even,\nof those with vast experience are still quite clumsy. The only way is to\nkeep at it._\n\n_We hope that this book will fill a long-felt want. Surely of all\nlong-felt wants the want of love seems longest._\n\n_It is for the earnest student of True Love that we have compiled this\ncyclopedia._\n\nJohn Cecil Clay]\n\n\n\n\nA\n\nThe origin of the form of our capital letter A is supposed to have\nbeen an Egyptian symbol (see illustration) representing two people\nengaged in the ancient pastime called Kyssin, which survives even at the\npresent day. A, by many supposed to be the oldest of the alphabet and\nconstituting, as it does, the initial of Adam\u2019s name, was doubtless the\nonly letter in existence at the time Adam learned to write.\n\nThe words Ark, Antediluvian, Ancestry, Arch\u00e6ology, and Antiquity all\nsupport the above theory.\n\nGirls like Adelaide, Agatha, Agnes, Alice, Althea, Amanda, Amy, Angelina,\nand Arabella, whose initials fall in this letter will be Attractive,\nAmiable, Artless, and in the opposite sex most attracted by those of\nArdent, Ambitious, and Affable disposition.\n\n    ABSENCE.

In the hieroglyphics of the times\nit was written as this fragment will show, the form being taken from\nHipopotamia\u2019s little pet dog, Hydrophobia.\n\nD has turned out to be one of the most useful letters in Cupid\u2019s\nAlphabet, beginning as it does, Dearie, Ducky, Dreams, Delight,\nDetermination, and Desire. But it has an unhappy side in Don\u2019t,\nDisappointment, and Despair.\n\nThe girls under this letter are all Darlings. See any one of them.\n\n    DARLING.

A way for two people, who are not married to each\n    other, to pass the time. As a matter of fact a flirtation isn\u2019t\n    anything, it\u2019s a thing to do and is really easier to do than to\n    describe. There are many sorts of Flirtation. The Every-day\n    or Sidewalk Flirtation is the commonest kind. Other very\n    popular forms are the Eye, the Eyebrow, the Fan, the Glove, the\n    Handkerchief, and the Foot Flirtation.\n\n    A natural attribute to woman, but an easily acquired\n    accomplishment in man.\n\n    FOREVER.

And O\nthe joys of life! For without H where would Happiness and the Honeymoon\nbe? And where Heart, Hope, Health, and Harmony?\n\nGirls under this sign will be Handsome, Honest, and Home-loving, but\nthose named Helen, Harriet, Henrietta, and Hannah seem to be easily\nHypnotized by Hollow, Hypocritical Humbugs of the opposite sex.\n\n_Hooray!_\n\n    HAPPINESS.

Why? Because a Jay\nBird is blue, a Duck has webbed feet, and an Owl a hooked bill.\n\nIt is a jolly letter and has been the beginning of much Joy and foolish\nJealousy. The worst thing it ever did was when it started the word Jilt.\n\nThe men most attractive to such Jolly girls as Jane, Julia, Josephine,\nJemima, Juliet, and Juliana are those of Just but Jovial disposition.\n\n    JEALOUSY.

An angel unawares. Originally _Jolt_, _i. e._, a jolt on\n    the path of True Love which never runs smooth.

The\nbirds never sang so sweetly, the butterflies never seemed so brilliant.\nThe little silver brook fell into the lake with so soothing a sound and\nthe drowsy hum of the bee was like a lullaby. Such a dreamy contentment\nseemed to pervade the whole Garden. Like the breath of a rose a caressing\nzephyr sighed overhead and creaked ever so little the old signboard\nnestled among the leaves. The old signboard with this inscription in\nquaint characters, \u201c_Quamdiu se bene gesserit_.\u201d Adam looked up from\nwhere he lolled in the soft grass and smiled as at an old friend. He\nstretched and drew a deep breath of content. The day seemed the most\nwonderful he had known.\n\n_Friday_, Black Friday they called it afterward, broke clear and bright,\nbut on the horizon great piles of black cloud and far off the ominous\nmuttering of thunder. All nature seemed nervous and a-tremble. The breeze\nwas fitful and petulant and the hush of some impending evil hung over the\nGarden. The old signboard creaked sharply. Poor Adam! (Poor Us!!!)

It is a\ngreen and fertile country, and the principal occupation of its people\nis hearticultural husbandry. The form of government is Home Rule, and\nto become a citizen, although born in the country, it is required that\nat least one complete journey be made from end to end of the country\u2019s\nprincipal highway. This at first seems an odd requirement, but there is\ngood reasoning behind it. First, as this great highway, known as the Path\nof True Love, in its devious windings touches practically every portion\nof the kingdom\u2014the trip is likely to open the traveller\u2019s eyes and teach\nhim much of the resources and conditions of the country he wishes to call\nhis own. Second, as the road is rough and in places sometimes seemingly\nimpassable, the trip will test the determination and stability of the\nmost hearty.\n\nTurn to the map and we find Amoria bounded on three sides by\nMisanthropia, the State of Indifference, and the Sea of Oblivion,\nemptying into which the Quarrel River forever pours its flotsam and\njetsam. On the upper side you will see it is bounded by the edge of the\nmap; this is because it is too cold in that direction to sustain human\nlife.\n\nSHOWING THE DEVIOUS WINDINGS OF THE PATH OF TRUE LOVE WITH THE MANY\nDANGERS AND OBSTACLES THAT BESET THE WAY, AND SHOWING, LIKEWISE, THE\nSEVERAL UNFORTUNATE BY-PATHS LIKELY TO MISLEAD THE WAYFARER TO A WRONG\nTURNING. WHEREBY MUCH VALUABLE TIME MIGHT BE LOST AND A LARGE DEGREE OF\nUNHAPPINESS ENCOUNTERED, BESIDES A RETRACING OF MANY SAD AND FATIGUING\nSTEPS]\n\nLet us now follow, upon the map, the course of this historic road.\n\nFar up in the corner of the map we find Mount Curiosity\u2014its snow-capped\npeaks lost in the soft gray veil of mist that has prevented the\nscientists from determining its greatest heights. The ascent of the\nmountain is usually made on the side where it comes nearest to the State\nof Indifference (see note Y); here a well-worn path, known as the Path\nof Least Resistance, takes one by such a gradual and agreeable route\nthat little or no effort is realized in the climb, and it is usually a\nsurprise when, just a little below the frost line, one comes suddenly\nupon a little plateau high, high, in the heavens. Here the air is\nsalubrious and the temperature even. The view is so wonderful in the\nearly Dawn that the most phlegmatic will become enthusiastic. This little\nplateau is known as the Plateau Platonic and is quite flat. In spite of\nits beauty and charm few travellers are satisfied to rest here long.\n\nIn leaving the plateau one must have a care, for there are two paths\nquite similar in appearance\u2014one leading up the mountain to nowhere and\nloneliness, and the other the commencement of the Path of True Love. The\ncareful traveller need not mistake the path, for beside the entrance,\nat about the height of a man\u2019s heart and nailed to a great Oak, is a\ncrudely fashioned hand with finger pointing the way. This is called the\nHand of Fate. Alas, too few take the trouble to look for this guide, and\nmany take the wrong path; while those who, by sheer luck, take the right\none are easily discouraged because of the very uncertain condition of\nmind they soon find themselves in. These usually lose heart before going\na great way, or in their careless method of progress take some wrong\nturning and come to a swift and bad end.\n\nBut we will follow the progress of the traveller who believes in signs.\n\nIt is hard to describe those first impressions as one comes swinging down\nthe mountainside and sees winding far out and across the verdant Valley\nof Dreams, dotted here and there with its picturesque castles, the Path\nof True Love like a silver thread. It seems so bright and pure, and off\nto the right there is such a happy pink glow in the sky, that one usually\nfinds himself humming some old love song.\n\nLucky the traveller who puts a clover in his buttonhole, while crossing\nthe Valley of Dreams, for all too soon the cold winds that sweep\nacross Lake Indifference, and make the trip around it a perilous and\ndiscouraging one, will be chilling his marrow. He will need both courage\nand luck when, rounding the upper end of the lake, he comes upon the\nrough and rocky stretch of road running along the edge of a fearful\nprecipice which overhangs the lake, and is known as the Height of\nIndifference; here one false step and all is lost. Past this danger\nthe road turns from the lake, but the traveller has hardly time to\ncongratulate himself upon the warmer conditions when he is confronted\nby a most disconcerting range of mountains known as the Mountains of\nOpposition. If you do not cross the mountains the mountains will double\ncross you, so push on and with tact and determination they will be\novercome.\n\nThe mountains passed, a smooth bit of road is reached and brighter\nweather, that, after the lowering clouds, the storms and many obstacles\nmet with in the mountains, will likely mislead the traveller into\nthinking his troubles over. Light-hearted he will push forward hurriedly,\ntaking little heed of the fast increasing cold. Fortunately, just at\nthe edge of the map and just upon the longitude of Respect, the road\ntakes a sudden sharp turn, but it is almost from bad to worse, for it\nplunges the traveller into the Forest of Misunderstanding, a dark and\ndismal place that will fill the strongest with misgivings. The only way\nis to stick close to the road. This is sometimes hard in the darkness\nas there are many by-paths. Travellers once off the correct road have\nbeen known to wander for years without once seeing the sunlight. About\nhalf way through the forest there is a road turning to the right; it\nseems the easier way, dipping down, as it does, into a little valley and\nacross a turbulent little stream, beyond which it disappears from sight\nin the tangle of brilliant foliage covering Mount Folly. Unhappy he who\ntakes this turn, for there is many a slippery stone in the bed of this\nstream and the crossing is not a happy one. If one would turn back at the\nfirst slip, but human nature is stubborn and few do; besides there seems\nlittle choice between the dismal forest behind and the lure of Mt. Folly\nahead. Folly lasts but a day, however, and the foliage soon loses its\nattractive coloring. The foolish wayfarer then pushing on finds himself\nagain confronted by the turbulent stream, but easier to cross this time.\nA little way further the path ends at what appears to be a refreshing\nspring; it is the Spring of Untruth, and he who lies to drink of its\nwaters will ever be a slave of the drug.\n\nAgain as one is nearing the edges of the Black Forest is another road\nleading off to the left and to the Spring of Mistrust. Turn not aside nor\ndrink of this spring; its waters are bitter and this turning but takes\none back into the depths of the dismal forest.\n\nEmerging from the Black Forest of Misunderstanding the road winds across\na fertile and easy-going prairie land, twice crossing the acid waters of\nBicker Brook (see note 23), and crossing the Quarrel River takes its\ncourse along the foot of what, by many, is considered the most beautiful\nmountain in Amoria, Mount Unselfishness. The going is easy here, and\nwhen one comes to a little road branching off and running right up the\nmountain side he is apt to feel very little inclination to take it.\nNearly every traveller knows by hearsay that this is a short-cut one\nshould take, but standing at the foot of the mountain, with a broad\nsmooth road on one hand and this little used difficult mountain path\n(it is hardly more than a blazed trail) on the other, it is much to the\ntraveller\u2019s credit who attempts it at all. Quite a few do, however,\nbegin the ascent, but almost without exception have not the strength to\ncontinue and turn back to the main highway, only to be shortly plunged\nagain and again in the cold and caustic waters of the Quarrel River as\nthe road crosses and recrosses it. There are no bridges here, and many\na poor traveller becoming exhausted in the mad battle with the current\nhopelessly loses all self-control and is carried away to be lost in the\nSea of Oblivion. At the river\u2019s mouth is Lost Hope Island; this is really\nnothing more than a bar, and superstition has it that there, on stormy\nnights when the tide is coming in, congregate those poor lost souls, and\nit is claimed, on good authority, that the discords of their mournful\nsongs can be heard even as far as to the edges of the Desert of Absence.\n\nAfter these several crossings of the Quarrel River the road again becomes\neasy and travel should be a pleasure, but the traveller is weary from\nthe recent struggle with the river, and is almost thankful for the\nflat stretch of road where it first crosses the Desert of Absence.\nIt were often better if this bit of road were longer, for before the\ntraveller entirely regains his former vim he is deep in the unhealthy\nmists and quicksands of the Slough of Despond, and it is in a very\nweakened condition that he commences the second crossing of the Desert of\nAbsence. In this condition is it strange that one loiter in the Oasis of\nFlirtation\u2014the one bright spot in an otherwise dull desert? But an oasis\nand a flirtation have their limits, and when one\u2019s thirst is satisfied\none wants to move on. And well this is for the traveller on the Path\nof True Love, for only a little and the desert is passed, and the road\nleads for many happy miles through the sweetest and most beautiful meadow\nland where the warm sunlight, the songs of the birds, and the sweet\nodor of new-mown hay repay one for all the hardships of the past, and\nso stimulate the traveller that he strikes out upon the third crossing\nof the Desert of Absence with a light step and a song in his heart,\nand though the trip is longer it seems far shorter than either of the\nprevious crossings. So happy indeed has he been and, with the soft airs\nof the desert making his heart grow fonder, the way seems so easy that\nthe sudden obstruction of two of the lesser spurs of the Mountains of\nOpposition fill him with misgiving, and the valley between them is well\nnamed Blue Valley. (See note 13.)\n\nIn such a condition of mind the traveller plunges down the mountain\nside and is soon deep in a great gloomy forest, not likely to raise his\nspirits, but rather calculated to depress them still more.\n\nImagine then the elation when bursting at length from the depression of\nthe Forest of Gloom the traveller sees before him that transcendently\nbeautiful mountain, Mount Hope. Well may he hold his breath and gaze in\nrapture, for before him rises the most beautiful mountain in all the\nworld and will ever be as long as life lasts. With its velvety slopes and\nshaded dells, its little silver rills tinkling down the mountain side,\nsounding like fairy laughter through the trees, the gently stirring air\nfreighted with the perfume of myriads of fragrant blossoms, and over all\na tender rose-colored glow reflected from the soft pinky clouds that\nforever tenderly rest upon the mountain\u2019s top, it is indeed the most\nbeautiful of nature\u2019s jewels. So it seems, with Hope so long deferred,\nto that tired-eyed struggler upon Love\u2019s Highway, often heartsick and\noppressed by the vicissitudes of the way, for here he may rest and,\ngazing again out over the dear Valley of Dreams, rejuvenate the Yearning,\nthe Ambition, and the Determination that have brought him through so much.\n\nTo these he may now add Hope, and so equipped and refreshed he dashes\na second time through the Forest of Gloom, and though confronted by\nthe most stubborn and rocky section (known as the Parent Peak) in the\nentire range of the Mountains of Opposition, his past experience and\nhis added strength carry him over with little effort, and, coming down\nthe last steep slope, his heart gives a bound as his eye follows the\nsmooth roadway stretching invitingly across a nearly level expanse of\nwell-cultivated country thickly dotted with the happy homes of those\nwho had once been travellers like himself. If he be not short-sighted,\nhe is able to see even as far ahead as to where the road and his lonely\njourney end in heavenly Mount Heart\u2019s Desire. As he passes along many a\ncheerful face smiles out at him from the doorways, and many a cheerful\nword of welcome and greeting encourages him to hasten. The smiles of the\nrosy-cheeked children seem especially sweet to him.\n\nThe journey\u2019s end! The goal is reached! Naught remains further for the\ntraveller now except the Oath of Allegiance which is performed with\nconsiderable ceremony in the little church just around the corner to the\nleft.\n\nNOTE:\u2014Mount Heart\u2019s Desire is of an attractive shape and thickly\nsurrounded by orange blossoms. No two travellers agree as to its height,\nbut we are of the opinion that it _must_ be about five feet, three or\nfour inches. Within it is a little shrine called Trust, which it is the\nduty of every worshipper to protect.\n\nNOTE Y. It seems more than mere coincidence that the Path of Least\nResistance should run up Mount Curiosity on the side nearest to the\nborders of the State of Indifference, and there is a very ancient\ntradition that the first person to make the ascent came from that\neasy-going country.\n\nWe believe this tradition to be another version of the Adam and Eve\nstory, and feel that it conclusively proves us right in our calculations\nas to the exact location of the Garden of Eden. We claim it was situated\nin that part of the State of Indifference near to and in full view of\nMount Curiosity, and that Adam was the first man to make the climb. We\nalso believe that Adam became lost on the mountainside and never returned\nto Eden, and that the Path of True Love gives a pretty good idea of his\nsubsequent wanderings, of which so little heretofore has been known.\n\nAt any rate, vast numbers from the State of Indifference make the ascent\nof Mount Curiosity every year, and many of our best citizens have come\nfrom that state.\n\nNOTE 23. At this point, after the more or less extended journey through\nthe unhealthy Forest of Misunderstanding, the traveller must have a\ncare, especially if he be of a sensitive nature, for the shock of the\nfirst plunge through Bicker Brook will often throw one into a distemper\nor fever. Some, going absolutely out of their heads, wander far afield.\nHerein lies a grave danger because of the nearness of the road at this\npoint to the boundaries of Misanthropia, which state is little more than\na barren waste. The peculiar mental attitude of its inhabitants gives\nstrength to the theory advanced in Amoria that its population is made up\nof those poor fever-ridden souls who have wandered from the Path of True\nLove and gone quite mad.\n\nNOTE 13. The higher one climbs the duller the thud. So with the traveller\nwho has been dreaming across sweet meadow land and balmy wastes when\nsuddenly confronted by a renewal of obstacles which his optimism had made\nhim believe passed forever, and it is in a nervous and uncertain state of\nmind we find him groping his way through the mists that always fill Blue\nValley. Here is a great danger, for with the steep mountains on three\nsides the traveller, if he once stumble from the road, is apt to follow\nthe depression of the valley until morbid and benumbed he wander into the\nState of Indifference.\n\nThe same danger, in a lesser degree, is lurking in the Forest of Gloom.\n\n\n\n\n_APPENDIX_\n\n\nThe Appendix has been removed.\n\n\n\n\n",
