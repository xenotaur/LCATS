    "body": "WHY Mrs. General Talboys first made up her mind to pass the winter of\n1859 at Rome I never clearly understood.  To myself she explained her\npurposes, soon after her arrival at the Eternal City, by declaring, in\nher own enthusiastic manner, that she was inspired by a burning desire to\ndrink fresh at the still living fountains of classical poetry and\nsentiment.  But I always thought that there was something more than this\nin it.  Classical poetry and sentiment were doubtless very dear to her;\nbut so also, I imagine, were the substantial comforts of Hardover Lodge,\nthe General's house in Berkshire; and I do not think that she would have\nemigrated for the winter had there not been some slight domestic\nmisunderstanding.  Let this, however, be fully made clear,--that such\nmisunderstanding, if it existed, must have been simply an affair of\ntemper.  No impropriety of conduct has, I am very sure, ever been imputed\nto the lady.  The General, as all the world knows, is hot; and Mrs.\nTalboys, when the sweet rivers of her enthusiasm are unfed by congenial\nwaters, can, I believe, make herself disagreeable.\n\nBut be this as it may, in November, 1859, Mrs. Talboys came among us\nEnglish at Rome, and soon succeeded in obtaining for herself a\ncomfortable footing in our society.  We all thought her more remarkable\nfor her mental attributes than for physical perfection; but,\nnevertheless, she was, in her own way, a sightly woman.  She had no\nspecial brilliance, either of eye or complexion, such as would produce\nsudden flames in susceptible hearts; nor did she seem to demand instant\nhomage by the form and step of a goddess; but we found her to be a\ngood-looking woman of some thirty or thirty-three years of age, with\nsoft, peach-like cheeks,--rather too like those of a cherub, with\nsparkling eyes which were hardly large enough, with good teeth, a white\nforehead, a dimpled chin and a full bust.  Such, outwardly, was Mrs.\nGeneral Talboys.  The description of the inward woman is the purport to\nwhich these few pages will be devoted.\n\nThere are two qualities to which the best of mankind are much subject,\nwhich are nearly related to each other, and as to which the world has not\nyet decided whether they are to be classed among the good or evil\nattributes of our nature.  Men and women are under the influence of them\nboth, but men oftenest undergo the former, and women the latter.  They\nare ambition and enthusiasm.  Now Mrs. Talboys was an enthusiastic woman.\n\nAs to ambition, generally as the world agrees with Mark Antony in\nstigmatising it as a grievous fault, I am myself clear that it is a\nvirtue; but with ambition at present we have no concern.  Enthusiasm\nalso, as I think, leans to virtue's side; or, at least, if it be a fault,\nof all faults it is the prettiest.  But then, to partake at all of\nvirtue, or even to be in any degree pretty, the enthusiasm must be true.\n\nBad coin is known from good by the ring of it; and so is bad enthusiasm.\nLet the coiner be ever so clever at his art, in the coining of enthusiasm\nthe sound of true gold can never be imparted to the false metal.  And I\ndoubt whether the cleverest she in the world can make false enthusiasm\npalatable to the taste of man.  To the taste of any woman the enthusiasm\nof another woman is never very palatable.\n\nWe understood at Home that Mrs. Talboys had a considerable family,--four\nor five children, we were told; but she brought with her only one\ndaughter, a little girl about twelve years of age.  She had torn herself\nasunder, as she told me, from the younger nurslings of her heart, and had\nleft them to the care of a devoted female attendant, whose love was all\nbut maternal.  And then she said a word or two about the General, in\nterms which made me almost think that this quasi-maternal love extended\nitself beyond the children.  The idea, however, was a mistaken one,\narising from the strength of her language, to which I was then\nunaccustomed.  I have since become aware that nothing can be more\ndecorous than old Mrs. Upton, the excellent head-nurse at Hardover Lodge;\nand no gentleman more discreet in his conduct than General Talboys.\n\nAnd I may as well here declare, also, that there could be no more\nvirtuous woman than the General's wife.  Her marriage vow was to her\nparamount to all other vows and bonds whatever.  The General's honour was\nquite safe when he sent her off to Rome by herself; and he no doubt knew\nthat it was so.  Illi robur et aes triplex, of which I believe no weapons\nof any assailant could get the better.  But, nevertheless, we used to\nfancy that she had no repugnance to impropriety in other women,--to what\nthe world generally calls impropriety.  Invincibly attached herself to\nthe marriage tie, she would constantly speak of it as by no means\nnecessarily binding on others; and, virtuous herself as any griffin of\npropriety, she constantly patronised, at any rate, the theory of\ninfidelity in her neighbours.  She was very eager in denouncing the\nprejudices of the English world, declaring that she had found existence\namong them to be no longer possible for herself.  She was hot against the\nstern unforgiveness of British matrons, and equally eager in reprobating\nthe stiff conventionalities of a religion in which she said that none of\nits votaries had faith, though they all allowed themselves to be\nenslaved.\n\nWe had at that time a small set at Rome, consisting chiefly of English\nand Americans, who habitually met at each other's rooms, and spent many\nof our evening hours in discussing Italian politics.  We were, most of\nus, painters, poets, novelists, or sculptors;--perhaps I should say\nwould-be painters, poets, novelists, and sculptors,--aspirants hoping to\nbecome some day recognised; and among us Mrs. Talboys took her place,\nnaturally enough, on account of a very pretty taste she had for painting.\n\nI do not know that she ever originated anything that was grand; but she\nmade some nice copies, and was fond, at any rate, of art conversation.\nShe wrote essays, too, which she showed in confidence to various\ngentlemen, and had some idea of taking lessons in modelling.\n\nIn all our circle Conrad Mackinnon, an American, was, perhaps, the person\nmost qualified to be styled its leader.  He was one who absolutely did\ngain his living, and an ample living too, by his pen, and was regarded on\nall sides as a literary lion, justified by success in roaring at any tone\nhe might please.  His usual roar was not exactly that of a sucking-dove\nor a nightingale; but it was a good-humoured roar, not very offensive to\nany man, and apparently acceptable enough to some ladies.  He was a big\nburly man, near to fifty as I suppose, somewhat awkward in his gait, and\nsomewhat loud in his laugh.  But though nigh to fifty, and thus ungainly,\nhe liked to be smiled on by pretty women, and liked, as some said, to be\nflattered by them also.  If so, he should have been happy, for the ladies\nat Rome at that time made much of Conrad Mackinnon.\n\nOf Mrs. Mackinnon no one did make very much, and yet she was one of the\nsweetest, dearest, quietest, little creatures that ever made glad a man's\nfireside.  She was exquisitely pretty, always in good humour, never\nstupid, self-denying to a fault, and yet she was generally in the\nbackground.  She would seldom come forward of her own will, but was\ncontented to sit behind her teapot and hear Mackinnon do his roaring.  He\nwas certainly much given to what the world at Rome called flirting, but\nthis did not in the least annoy her.  She was twenty years his junior,\nand yet she never flirted with any one.  Women would tell\nher--good-natured friends--how Mackinnon went on; but she received such\ntidings as an excellent joke, observing that he had always done the same,\nand no doubt always would until he was ninety.  I do believe that she was\na happy woman; and yet I used to think that she should have been happier.\nThere is, however, no knowing the inside of another man's house, or\nreading the riddles of another man's joy and sorrow.\n\nWe had also there another lion,--a lion cub,--entitled to roar a little,\nand of him also I must say something.  Charles O'Brien was a young man,\nabout twenty-five years of age, who had sent out from his studio in the\npreceding year a certain bust, supposed by his admirers to be unsurpassed\nby any effort of ancient or modern genius.  I am no judge of sculpture,\nand will not, therefore, pronounce an opinion; but many who considered\nthemselves to be judges, declared that it was a \"goodish head and\nshoulders,\" and nothing more.  I merely mention the fact, as it was on\nthe strength of that head and shoulders that O'Brien separated himself\nfrom a throng of others such as himself in Rome, walked solitary during\nthe days, and threw himself at the feet of various ladies when the days\nwere over.  He had ridden on the shoulders of his bust into a prominent\nplace in our circle, and there encountered much feminine admiration--from\nMrs. General Talboys and others.\n\nSome eighteen or twenty of us used to meet every Sunday evening in Mrs.\nMackinnon's drawing-room.  Many of us, indeed, were in the habit of\nseeing each other daily, and of visiting together the haunts in Rome\nwhich are best loved by art-loving strangers; but here, in this\ndrawing-room, we were sure to come together, and here before the end of\nNovember, Mrs. Talboys might always be found, not in any accustomed seat,\nbut moving about the room as the different male mental attractions of our\nsociety might chance to move themselves.  She was at first greatly taken\nby Mackinnon,--who also was, I think, a little stirred by her admiration,\nthough he stoutly denied the charge.  She became, however, very dear to\nus all before she left us, and certainly we owed to her our love, for she\nadded infinitely to the joys of our winter.\n\n\"I have come here to refresh myself,\" she said to Mackinnon one\nevening--to Mackinnon and myself; for we were standing together.\n\n\"Shall I get you tea?\" said I.\n\n\"And will you have something to eat?\" Mackinnon asked.\n\n\"No, no, no;\" she answered.  \"Tea, yes; but for Heaven's sake let nothing\nsolid dispel the associations of such a meeting as this!\"\n\n\"I thought you might have dined early,\" said Mackinnon.  Now Mackinnon\nwas a man whose own dinner was very dear to him.  I have seen him become\nhasty and unpleasant, even under the pillars of the Forum, when he\nthought that the party were placing his fish in jeopardy by their desire\nto linger there too long.\n\n\"Early!  Yes.  No; I know not when it was.  One dines and sleeps in\nobedience to that dull clay which weighs down so generally the particle\nof our spirit.  But the clay may sometimes be forgotten.  Here I can\nalways forget it.\"\n\n\"I thought you asked for refreshment,\" I said.  She only looked at me,\nwhose small attempts at prose composition had, up to that time, been\naltogether unsuccessful, and then addressed herself in reply to\nMackinnon.\n\n\"It is the air which we breathe that fills our lungs and gives us life\nand light.  It is that which refreshes us if pure, or sinks us into\nstagnation if it be foul.  Let me for awhile inhale the breath of an\ninvigorating literature.  Sit down, Mr. Mackinnon; I have a question that\nI must put to you.\"  And then she succeeded in carrying him off into a\ncorner.  As far as I could see he went willingly enough at that time,\nthough he soon became averse to any long retirement in company with Mrs.\nTalboys.\n\nWe none of us quite understood what were her exact ideas on the subject\nof revealed religion.  Somebody, I think, had told her that there were\namong us one or two whose opinions were not exactly orthodox according to\nthe doctrines of the established English church.  If so, she was\ndetermined to show us that she also was advanced beyond the prejudices of\nan old and dry school of theology.  \"I have thrown down all the barriers\nof religion,\" she said to poor Mrs. Mackinnon, \"and am looking for the\nsentiments of a pure Christianity.\"\n\n\"Thrown down all the barriers of religion!\" said Mrs. Mackinnon, in a\ntone of horror which was not appreciated.\n\n\"Indeed, yes,\" said Mrs. Talboys, with an exulting voice.  \"Are not the\ndays for such trammels gone by?\"\n\n\"But yet you hold by Christianity?\"\n\n\"A pure Christianity, unstained by blood and perjury, by hypocrisy and\nverbose genuflection.  Can I not worship and say my prayers among the\nclouds?\"  And she pointed to the lofty ceiling and the handsome\nchandelier.\n\n\"But Ida goes to church,\" said Mrs. Mackinnon.  Ida Talboys was her\ndaughter.  Now, it may be observed, that many who throw down the barriers\nof religion, so far as those barriers may affect themselves, still\nmaintain them on behalf of their children.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Talboys;\n\"dear Ida! her soft spirit is not yet adapted to receive the perfect\ntruth.  We are obliged to govern children by the strength of their\nprejudices.\"  And then she moved away, for it was seldom that Mrs.\nTalboys remained long in conversation with any lady.\n\nMackinnon, I believe, soon became tired of her.  He liked her flattery,\nand at first declared that she was clever and nice; but her niceness was\ntoo purely celestial to satisfy his mundane tastes.  Mackinnon himself\ncan revel among the clouds in his own writings, and can leave us\nsometimes in doubt whether he ever means to come back to earth; but when\nhis foot is on terra firma, he loves to feel the earthly substratum which\nsupports his weight.  With women he likes a hand that can remain an\nunnecessary moment within his own, an eye that can glisten with the\nsparkle of champagne, a heart weak enough to make its owner's arm tremble\nwithin his own beneath the moonlight gloom of the Coliseum arches.  A\ndash of sentiment the while makes all these things the sweeter; but the\nsentiment alone will not suffice for him.  Mrs. Talboys did, I believe,\ndrink her glass of champagne, as do other ladies; but with her it had no\nsuch pleasing effect.  It loosened only her tongue, but never her eye.\nHer arm, I think, never trembled, and her hand never lingered.  The\nGeneral was always safe, and happy, perhaps, in his solitary safety.\n\nIt so happened that we had unfortunately among us two artists who had\nquarrelled with their wives.  O'Brien, whom I have before mentioned, was\none of them.  In his case, I believe him to have been almost as free from\nblame as a man can be whose marriage was in itself a fault.  However, he\nhad a wife in Ireland some ten years older than himself; and though he\nmight sometimes almost forget the fact, his friends and neighbours were\nwell aware of it.  In the other case the whole fault probably was with\nthe husband.  He was an ill-tempered, bad-hearted man, clever enough, but\nwithout principle; and he was continually guilty of the great sin of\nspeaking evil of the woman whose name he should have been anxious to\nprotect.  In both cases our friend Mrs. Talboys took a warm interest, and\nin each of them she sympathised with the present husband against the\nabsent wife.\n\nOf the consolation which she offered in the latter instance we used to\nhear something from Mackinnon.  He would repeat to his wife, and to me\nand my wife, the conversations which she had with him.  \"Poor Brown;\" she\nwould say, \"I pity him, with my very heart's blood.\"\n\n\"You are aware that he has comforted himself in his desolation,\"\nMackinnon replied.\n\n\"I know very well to what you allude.  I think I may say that I am\nconversant with all the circumstances of this heart-blighting sacrifice.\"\nMrs. Talboys was apt to boast of the thorough confidence reposed in her\nby all those in whom she took an interest.  \"Yes, he has sought such\ncomfort in another love as the hard cruel world would allow him.\"\n\n\"Or perhaps something more than that,\" said Mackinnon.  \"He has a family\nhere in Rome, you know; two little babies.\"\n\n\"I know it, I know it,\" she said.  \"Cherub angels!\" and as she spoke she\nlooked up into the ugly face of Marcus Aurelius; for they were standing\nat the moment under the figure of the great horseman on the Campidoglio.\n\"I have seen them, and they are the children of innocence.  If all the\nblood of all the Howards ran in their veins it could not make their birth\nmore noble!\"\n\n\"Not if the father and mother of all the Howards had never been married,\"\nsaid Mackinnon.\n\n\"What; that from you, Mr. Mackinnon!\" said Mrs. Talboys, turning her back\nwith energy upon the equestrian statue, and looking up into the faces,\nfirst of Pollux and then of Castor, as though from them she might gain\nsome inspiration on the subject which Marcus Aurelius in his coldness had\ndenied to her.  \"From you, who have so nobly claimed for mankind the\ndivine attributes of free action!  From you, who have taught my mind to\nsoar above the petty bonds which one man in his littleness contrives for\nthe subjection of his brother.  Mackinnon! you who are so great!\"  And\nshe now looked up into his face.  \"Mackinnon, unsay those words.\"\n\n\"They _are_ illegitimate,\" said he; \"and if there was any landed\nproperty--\"\n\n\"Landed property! and that from an American!\"\n\n\"The children are English, you know.\"\n\n\"Landed property!  The time will shortly come--ay, and I see it\ncoming--when that hateful word shall be expunged from the calendar; when\nlanded property shall be no more.  What! shall the free soul of a\nGod-born man submit itself for ever to such trammels as that?  Shall we\nnever escape from the clay which so long has manacled the subtler\nparticles of the divine spirit?  Ay, yes, Mackinnon;\" and then she took\nhim by the arm, and led him to the top of the huge steps which lead down\nfrom the Campidoglio into the streets of modern Rome.  \"Look down upon\nthat countless multitude.\"  Mackinnon looked down, and saw three groups\nof French soldiers, with three or four little men in each group; he saw,\nalso, a couple of dirty friars, and three priests very slowly beginning\nthe side ascent to the church of the Ara Coeli.  \"Look down upon that\ncountless multitude,\" said Mrs. Talboys, and she stretched her arms out\nover the half-deserted city.  \"They are escaping now from these\ntrammels,--now, now,--now that I am speaking.\"\n\n\"They have escaped long ago from all such trammels as that of landed\nproperty,\" said Mackinnon.\n\n\"Ay, and from all terrestrial bonds,\" she continued, not exactly\nremarking the pith of his last observation; \"from bonds quasi-terrestrial\nand quasi-celestial.  The full-formed limbs of the present age, running\nwith quick streams of generous blood, will no longer bear the ligatures\nwhich past times have woven for the decrepit.  Look down upon that\nmultitude, Mackinnon; they shall all be free.\"  And then, still clutching\nhim by the arm, and still standing at the top of those stairs, she gave\nforth her prophecy with the fury of a Sybil.\n\n\"They shall all be free.  Oh, Rome, thou eternal one! thou who hast bowed\nthy neck to imperial pride and priestly craft; thou who hast suffered\nsorely, even to this hour, from Nero down to Pio Nono,--the days of thine\noppression are over.  Gone from thy enfranchised ways for ever is the\nclang of the Praetorian cohorts and the more odious drone of meddling\nmonks!\"  And yet, as Mackinnon observed, there still stood the dirty\nfriars and the small French soldiers; and there still toiled the slow\npriests, wending their tedious way up to the church of the Ara Coeli.\nBut that was the mundane view of the matter,--a view not regarded by Mrs.\nTalboys in her ecstasy.  \"O Italia,\" she continued, \"O Italia una, one\nand indivisible in thy rights, and indivisible also in thy wrongs! to us\nis it given to see the accomplishment of thy glory.  A people shall arise\naround thine altars greater in the annals of the world than thy Scipios,\nthy Gracchi, or thy Caesars.  Not in torrents of blood, or with screams\nof bereaved mothers, shall thy new triumphs be stained.  But mind shall\ndominate over matter; and doomed, together with Popes and Bourbons, with\ncardinals, diplomatists, and police spies, ignorance and prejudice shall\nbe driven from thy smiling terraces.  And then Rome shall again become\nthe fair capital of the fairest region of Europe.  Hither shall flock the\nartisans of the world, crowding into thy marts all that God and man can\ngive.  Wealth, beauty, and innocence shall meet in thy streets--\"\n\n\"There will be a considerable change before that takes place,\" said\nMackinnon.\n\n\"There shall be a considerable change,\" she answered.  \"Mackinnon, to\nthee it is given to read the signs of the time; and hast thou not read?\nWhy have the fields of Magenta and Solferino been piled with the corpses\nof dying heroes?  Why have the waters of the Mincio ran red with the\nblood of martyrs?  That Italy might be united and Rome immortal.  Here,\nstanding on the Capitolium of the ancient city, I say that it shall be\nso; and thou, Mackinnon, who hearest me, knowest that my words are true.\"\n\nThere was not then in Rome,--I may almost say there was not in Italy, an\nEnglishman or an American who did not wish well to the cause for which\nItaly was and is still contending; as also there is hardly one who does\nnot now regard that cause as well-nigh triumphant; but, nevertheless, it\nwas almost impossible to sympathise with Mrs. Talboys.  As Mackinnon\nsaid, she flew so high that there was no comfort in flying with her.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"Brown and the rest of them are down below.  Shall we go\nand join them?\"\n\n\"Poor Brown!  How was it that, in speaking of his troubles, we were led\non to this heart-stirring theme?  Yes, I have seen them, the sweet\nangels; and I tell you also that I have seen their mother.  I insisted on\ngoing to her when I heard her history from him.\"\n\n\"And what is she like, Mrs. Talboys?\"\n\n\"Well; education has done more for some of us than for others; and there\nare those from whose morals and sentiments we might thankfully draw a\nlesson, whose manners and outward gestures are not such as custom has\nmade agreeable to us.  You, I know, can understand that.  I have seen\nher, and feel sure that she is pure in heart and high in principle.  Has\nshe not sacrificed herself; and is not self-sacrifice the surest\nguarantee for true nobility of character?  Would Mrs. Mackinnon object to\nmy bringing them together?\"\n\nMackinnon was obliged to declare that he thought his wife would object;\nand from that time forth he and Mrs. Talboys ceased to be very close in\ntheir friendship.  She still came to the house every Sunday evening,\nstill refreshed herself at the fountains of his literary rills; but her\nspecial prophecies from henceforth were poured into other ears.  And it\nso happened that O'Brien now became her chief ally.  I do not remember\nthat she troubled herself much further with the cherub angels or with\ntheir mother; and I am inclined to think that, taking up warmly, as she\ndid, the story of O'Brien's matrimonial wrongs, she forgot the little\nhistory of the Browns.  Be that as it may, Mrs. Talboys and O'Brien now\nbecame strictly confidential, and she would enlarge by the half-hour\ntogether on the miseries of her friend's position, to any one whom she\ncould get to hear her.\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Fanny,\" Mackinnon said to his wife one day,--to his\nwife and to mine, for we were all together; \"we shall have a row in the\nhouse if we don't take care.  O'Brien will be making love to Mrs.\nTalboys.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Mrs. Mackinnon.  \"You are always thinking that somebody\nis going to make love to some one.\"\n\n\"Somebody always is,\" said he.\n\n\"She's old enough to be his mother,\" said Mrs. Mackinnon.\n\n\"What does that matter to an Irishman?\" said Mackinnon.  \"Besides, I\ndoubt if there is more than five years' difference between them.\"\n\n\"There must be more than that,\" said my wife.  \"Ida Talboys is twelve, I\nknow, and I am not quite sure that Ida is the eldest.\"\n\n\"If she had a son in the Guards it would make no difference,\" said\nMackinnon.  \"There are men who consider themselves bound to make love to\na woman under certain circumstances, let the age of the lady be what it\nmay.  O'Brien is such a one; and if she sympathises with him much\noftener, he will mistake the matter, and go down on his knees.  You ought\nto put him on his guard,\" he said, addressing himself to his wife.\n\n\"Indeed, I shall do no such thing,\" said she; \"if they are two fools,\nthey must, like other fools, pay the price of their folly.\"  As a rule\nthere could be no softer creature than Mrs. Mackinnon; but it seemed to\nme that her tenderness never extended itself in the direction of Mrs.\nTalboys.\n\nJust at this time, towards the end, that is, of November, we made a party\nto visit the tombs which lie along the Appian Way, beyond that most\nbeautiful of all sepulchres, the tomb of Cecilia Metella.  It was a\ndelicious day, and we had driven along this road for a couple of miles\nbeyond the walls of the city, enjoying the most lovely view which the\nneighbourhood of Rome affords,--looking over the wondrous ruins of the\nold aqueducts, up towards Tivoli and Palestrina.  Of all the environs of\nRome this is, on a fair clear day, the most enchanting; and here perhaps,\namong a world of tombs, thoughts and almost memories of the old, old days\ncome upon one with the greatest force.  The grandeur of Rome is best seen\nand understood from beneath the walls of the Coliseum, and its beauty\namong the pillars of the Forum and the arches of the Sacred Way; but its\nhistory and fall become more palpable to the mind, and more clearly\nrealised, out here among the tombs, where the eyes rest upon the\nmountains whose shades were cool to the old Romans as to us,--than\nanywhere within the walls of the city.  Here we look out at the same\nTivoli and the same Praeneste, glittering in the sunshine, embowered\namong the far-off valleys, which were dear to them; and the blue\nmountains have not crumbled away into ruins.  Within Rome itself we can\nsee nothing as they saw it.\n\nOur party consisted of some dozen or fifteen persons, and as a hamper\nwith luncheon in it had been left on the grassy slope at the base of the\ntomb of Cecilia Metella, the expedition had in it something of the nature\nof a picnic.  Mrs. Talboys was of course with us, and Ida Talboys.\nO'Brien also was there.  The hamper had been prepared in Mrs. Mackinnon's\nroom, under the immediate eye of Mackinnon himself, and they therefore\nwere regarded as the dominant spirits of the party.  My wife was leagued\nwith Mrs. Mackinnon, as was usually the case; and there seemed to be a\ngeneral opinion among those who were closely in confidence together, that\nsomething would happen in the O'Brien-Talboys matter.  The two had been\ninseparable on the previous evening, for Mrs. Talboys had been urging on\nthe young Irishman her counsels respecting his domestic troubles.  Sir\nCresswell Cresswell, she had told him, was his refuge.  \"Why should his\nsoul submit to bonds which the world had now declared to be intolerable?\nDivorce was not now the privilege of the dissolute rich.  Spirits which\nwere incompatible need no longer be compelled to fret beneath the same\ncobbles.\"  In short, she had recommended him to go to England and get rid\nof his wife, as she would, with a little encouragement, have recommended\nany man to get rid of anything.  I am sure that, had she been skilfully\nbrought on to the subject, she might have been induced to pronounce a\nverdict against such ligatures for the body as coats, waistcoats, and\ntrowsers.  Her aspirations for freedom ignored all bounds, and, in\ntheory, there were no barriers which she was not willing to demolish.\n\nPoor O'Brien, as we all now began to see, had taken the matter amiss.  He\nhad offered to make a bust of Mrs. Talboys, and she had consented,\nexpressing a wish that it might find a place among those who had devoted\nthemselves to the enfranchisement of their fellow-creatures.  I really\nthink she had but little of a woman's customary personal vanity.  I know\nshe had an idea that her eye was lighted up in her warmer moments by some\nspecial fire, that sparks of liberty shone round her brow, and that her\nbosom heaved with glorious aspirations; but all these feelings had\nreference to her inner genius, not to any outward beauty.  But O'Brien\nmisunderstood the woman, and thought it necessary to gaze into her face,\nand sigh as though his heart were breaking.  Indeed he declared to a\nyoung friend that Mrs. Talboys was perfect in her style of beauty, and\nbegan the bust with this idea.  It was gradually becoming clear to us all\nthat he would bring himself to grief; but in such a matter who can\ncaution a man?\n\nMrs. Mackinnon had contrived to separate them in making the carriage\narrangements on this day, but this only added fuel to the fire which was\nnow burning within O'Brien's bosom.  I believe that he really did love\nher, in his easy, eager, susceptible Irish way.  That he would get over\nthe little episode without any serious injury to his heart no one\ndoubted; but then, what would occur when the declaration was made?  How\nwould Mrs. Talboys bear it?\n\n\"She deserves it,\" said Mrs. Mackinnon.\n\n\"And twice as much,\" my wife added.  Why is it that women are so spiteful\nto each other?\n\nEarly in the day Mrs. Talboys clambered up to the top of a tomb, and made\na little speech, holding a parasol over her head.  Beneath her feet, she\nsaid, reposed the ashes of some bloated senator, some glutton of the\nempire, who had swallowed into his maw the provision necessary for a\ntribe.  Old Rome had fallen through such selfishness as that; but new\nRome would not forget the lesson.  All this was very well, and then\nO'Brien helped her down; but after this there was no separating them.\nFor her own part she would sooner have had Mackinnon at her elbow.  But\nMackinnon now had found some other elbow.\n\n\"Enough of that was as good as a feast,\" he had said to his wife.  And\ntherefore Mrs. Talboys, quite unconscious of evil, allowed herself to be\nengrossed by O'Brien.\n\nAnd then, about three o'clock, we returned to the hamper.  Luncheon under\nsuch circumstances always means dinner, and we arranged ourselves for a\nvery comfortable meal.  To those who know the tomb of Cecilia Metella no\ndescription of the scene is necessary, and to those who do not, no\ndescription will convey a fair idea of its reality.  It is itself a large\nlow tower of great diameter, but of beautiful proportion, standing far\noutside the city, close on to the side of the old Roman way.  It has been\nembattled on the top by some latter-day baron, in order that it might be\nused for protection to the castle, which has been built on and attached\nto it.  If I remember rightly, this was done by one of the Frangipani,\nand a very lovely ruin he has made of it.  I know no castellated old\ntumble-down residence in Italy more picturesque than this baronial\nadjunct to the old Roman tomb, or which better tallies with the ideas\nengendered within our minds by Mrs. Radcliffe and the Mysteries of\nUdolpho.  It lies along the road, protected on the side of the city by\nthe proud sepulchre of the Roman matron, and up to the long ruined walls\nof the back of the building stretches a grassy slope, at the bottom of\nwhich are the remains of an old Roman circus.  Beyond that is the long,\nthin, graceful line of the Claudian aqueduct, with Soracte in the\ndistance to the left, and Tivoli, Palestine, and Frascati lying among the\nhills which bound the view.  That Frangipani baron was in the right of\nit, and I hope he got the value of his money out of the residence which\nhe built for himself.  I doubt, however, that he did but little good to\nthose who lived in his close neighbourhood.\n\nWe had a very comfortable little banquet seated on the broken lumps of\nstone which lie about under the walls of the tomb.  I wonder whether the\nshade of Cecilia Metella was looking down upon us.  We have heard much of\nher in these latter days, and yet we know nothing about her, nor can\nconceive why she was honoured with a bigger tomb than any other Roman\nmatron.  There were those then among our party who believed that she\nmight still come back among us, and with due assistance from some cognate\nsusceptible spirit, explain to us the cause of her widowed husband's\nliberality.  Alas, alas! if we may judge of the Romans by ourselves, the\ntrue reason for such sepulchral grandeur would redound little to the\ncredit of the lady Cecilia Metella herself, or to that of Crassus, her\nbereaved and desolate lord.\n\nShe did not come among us on the occasion of this banquet, possibly\nbecause we had no tables there to turn in preparation for her presence;\nbut, had she done so, she could not have been more eloquent of things of\nthe other world than was Mrs. Talboys.  I have said that Mrs. Talboys'\neye never glanced more brightly after a glass of champagne, but I am\ninclined to think that on this occasion it may have done so.  O'Brien\nenacted Ganymede, and was, perhaps, more liberal than other latter-day\nGanymedes, to whose services Mrs. Talboys had been accustomed.  Let it\nnot, however, be suspected by any one that she exceeded the limits of a\ndiscreet joyousness.  By no means!  The generous wine penetrated,\nperhaps, to some inner cells of her heart, and brought forth thoughts in\nsparkling words, which otherwise might have remained concealed; but there\nwas nothing in what she thought or spoke calculated to give umbrage\neither to an anchorite or to a vestal.  A word or two she said or sung\nabout the flowing bowl, and once she called for Falernian; but beyond\nthis her converse was chiefly of the rights of man and the weakness of\nwomen; of the iron ages that were past, and of the golden time that was\nto come.\n\nShe called a toast and drank to the hopes of the latter historians of the\nnineteenth century.  Then it was that she bade O'Brien \"Fill high the\nbowl with Samian wine.\"  The Irishman took her at her word, and she\nraised the bumper, and waved it over her head before she put it to her\nlips.  I am bound to declare that she did not spill a drop.  \"The true\n'Falernian grape,'\" she said, as she deposited the empty beaker on the\ngrass beneath her elbow.  Viler champagne I do not think I ever\nswallowed; but it was the theory of the wine, not its palpable body\npresent there, as it were, in the flesh, which inspired her.  There was\nreally something grand about her on that occasion, and her enthusiasm\nalmost amounted to reality.\n\nMackinnon was amused, and encouraged her, as, I must confess, did I also.\nMrs. Mackinnon made useless little signs to her husband, really fearing\nthat the Falernian would do its good offices too thoroughly.  My wife,\ngetting me apart as I walked round the circle distributing viands,\nremarked that \"the woman was a fool, and would disgrace herself.\"  But I\nobserved that after the disposal of that bumper she worshipped the rosy\ngod in theory only, and therefore saw no occasion to interfere.  \"Come,\nBacchus,\" she said; \"and come, Silenus, if thou wilt; I know that ye are\nhovering round the graves of your departed favourites.  And ye, too,\nnymphs of Egeria,\" and she pointed to the classic grove which was all but\nclose to us as we sat there.  \"In olden days ye did not always despise\nthe abodes of men.  But why should we invoke the presence of the\ngods,--we, who can become godlike ourselves!  We ourselves are the\ndeities of the present age.  For us shall the tables be spread with\nambrosia; for us shall the nectar flow.\"\n\nUpon the whole it was very good fooling,--for awhile; and as soon as we\nwere tired of it we arose from our seats, and began to stroll about the\nplace.  It was beginning to be a little dusk, and somewhat cool, but the\nevening air was pleasant, and the ladies, putting on their shawls, did\nnot seem inclined at once to get into the carriages.  At any rate, Mrs.\nTalboys was not so inclined, for she started down the hill towards the\nlong low wall of the old Roman circus at the bottom; and O'Brien, close\nat her elbow, started with her.\n\n\"Ida, my dear, you had better remain here,\" she said to her daughter;\n\"you will be tired if you come as far as we are going.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, mamma, I shall not,\" said Ida.  \"You get tired much quicker than\nI do.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will; besides I do not wish you to come.\"  There was an end\nof it for Ida, and Mrs. Talboys and O'Brien walked off together, while we\nall looked into each other's faces.\n\n\"It would be a charity to go with them,\" said Mackinnon.\n\n\"Do you be charitable, then,\" said his wife.\n\n\"It should be a lady,\" said he.\n\n\"It is a pity that the mother of the spotless cherubim is not here for\nthe occasion,\" said she.  \"I hardly think that any one less gifted will\nundertake such a self sacrifice.\"  Any attempt of the kind would,\nhowever, now have been too late, for they were already at the bottom of\nthe hill.  O'Brien had certainly drunk freely of the pernicious contents\nof those long-necked bottles; and though no one could fairly accuse him\nof being tipsy, nevertheless that which might have made others drunk had\nmade him bold, and he dared to do--perhaps more than might become a man.\nIf under any circumstances he could be fool enough to make an avowal of\nlove to Mrs. Talboys, he might be expected, as we all thought, to do it\nnow.\n\nWe watched them as they made for a gap in the wall which led through into\nthe large enclosed space of the old circus.  It had been an arena for\nchariot games, and they had gone down with the avowed purpose of\nsearching where might have been the meta, and ascertaining how the\ndrivers could have turned when at their full speed.  For awhile we had\nheard their voices,--or rather her voice especially.  \"The heart of a\nman, O'Brien, should suffice for all emergencies,\" we had heard her say.\nShe had assumed a strange habit of calling men by their simple names, as\nmen address each other.  When she did this to Mackinnon, who was much\nolder than herself, we had been all amused by it, and, other ladies of\nour party had taken to call him \"Mackinnon\" when Mrs. Talboys was not by;\nbut we had felt the comedy to be less safe with O'Brien, especially when,\non one occasion, we heard him address her as Arabella.  She did not seem\nto be in any way struck by his doing so, and we supposed, therefore, that\nit had become frequent between them.  What reply he made at the moment\nabout the heart of a man I do not know;--and then in a few minutes they\ndisappeared through the gap in the wall.\n\nNone of us followed them, though it would have seemed the most natural\nthing in the world to do so had nothing out of the way been expected.  As\nit was we remained there round the tomb quizzing the little foibles of\nour dear friend, and hoping that O'Brien would be quick in what he was\ndoing.  That he would undoubtedly get a slap in the\nface--metaphorically--we all felt certain, for none of us doubted the\nrigid propriety of the lady's intentions.  Some of us strolled into the\nbuildings, and some of us got out on to the road; but we all of us were\nthinking that O'Brien was very slow a considerable time before we saw\nMrs. Talboys reappear through the gap.\n\nAt last, however, she was there, and we at once saw that she was alone.\nShe came on, breasting the hill with quick steps, and when she drew near\nwe could see that there was a frown as of injured majesty on her brow.\nMackinnon and his wife went forward to meet her.  If she were really in\ntrouble it would be fitting in some way to assist her; and of all women\nMrs. Mackinnon was the last to see another woman suffer from ill-usage\nwithout attempting to aid her.  \"I certainly never liked her,\" Mrs.\nMackinnon said afterwards; \"but I was bound to go and hear her tale, when\nshe really had a tale to tell.\"\n\nAnd Mrs. Talboys now had a tale to tell,--if she chose to tell it.  The\nladies of our party declared afterwards that she would have acted more\nwisely had she kept to herself both O'Brien's words to her and her\nanswer.  \"She was well able to take care of herself,\" Mrs. Mackinnon\nsaid; \"and, after all, the silly man had taken an answer when he got it.\"\nNot, however, that O'Brien had taken his answer quite immediately, as far\nas I could understand from what we heard of the matter afterwards.\n\nAt the present moment Mrs. Talboys came up the rising ground all alone,\nand at a quick pace.  \"The man has insulted me,\" she said aloud, as well\nas her panting breath would allow her, and as soon as she was near enough\nto Mrs. Mackinnon to speak to her.\n\n\"I am sorry for that,\" said Mrs. Mackinnon.  \"I suppose he has taken a\nlittle too much wine.\"\n\n\"No; it was a premeditated insult.  The base-hearted churl has failed to\nunderstand the meaning of true, honest sympathy.\"\n\n\"He will forget all about it when he is sober,\" said Mackinnon, meaning\nto comfort her.\n\n\"What care I what he remembers or what he forgets!\" she said, turning\nupon poor Mackinnon indignantly.  \"You men grovel so in your ideas--\"\n\"And yet,\" as Mackinnon said afterwards, \"she had been telling me that I\nwas a fool for the last three weeks.\"--\"You men grovel so in your ideas,\nthat you cannot understand the feelings of a true-hearted woman.  What\ncan his forgetfulness or his remembrance be to me?  Must not I remember\nthis insult?  Is it possible that I should forget it?\"\n\nMr. and Mrs. Mackinnon only had gone forward to meet her; but,\nnevertheless, she spoke so loud that all heard her who were still\nclustered round the spot on which we had dined.\n\n\"What has become of Mr. O'Brien?\" a lady whispered to me.\n\nI had a field-glass with me, and, looking round, I saw his hat as he was\nwalking inside the walls of the circus in the direction towards the city.\n\"And very foolish he must feel,\" said the lady.\n\n\"No doubt he is used to it,\" said another.\n\n\"But considering her age, you know,\" said the first, who might have been\nperhaps three years younger than Mrs. Talboys, and who was not herself\naverse to the excitement of a moderate flirtation.  But then why should\nshe have been averse, seeing that she had not as yet become subject to\nthe will of any imperial lord?\n\n\"He would have felt much more foolish,\" said the third, \"if she had\nlistened to what he said to her.\"\n\n\"Well I don't know,\" said the second; \"nobody would have known anything\nabout it then, and in a few weeks they would have gradually become tired\nof each other in the ordinary way.\"\n\nBut in the meantime Mrs. Talboys was among us.  There had been no attempt\nat secresy, and she was still loudly inveighing against the grovelling\npropensities of men.  \"That's quite true, Mrs. Talboys,\" said one of the\nelder ladies; \"but then women are not always so careful as they should\nbe.  Of course I do not mean to say that there has been any fault on your\npart.\"\n\n\"Fault on my part!  Of course there has been fault on my part.  No one\ncan make any mistake without fault to some extent.  I took him to be a\nman of sense, and he is a fool.  Go to Naples indeed!\"\n\n\"Did he want you to go to Naples?\" asked Mrs. Mackinnon.\n\n\"Yes; that was what he suggested.  We were to leave by the train for\nCivita Vecchia at six to-morrow morning and catch the steamer which\nleaves Leghorn to-night.  Don't tell me of wine.  He was prepared for\nit!\"  And she looked round about on us with an air of injured majesty in\nher face which was almost insupportable.\n\n\"I wonder whether he took the tickets over-night,\" said Mackinnon.\n\n\"Naples!\" she said, as though now speaking exclusively to herself; \"the\nonly ground in Italy which has as yet made no struggle on behalf of\nfreedom;--a fitting residence for such a dastard!\"\n\n\"You would have found it very pleasant at this season,\" said the\nunmarried lady, who was three years her junior.\n\nMy wife had taken Ida out of the way when the first complaining note from\nMrs. Talboys had been heard ascending the hill.  But now, when matters\nbegan gradually to become quiescent, she brought her back, suggesting, as\nshe did so, that they might begin to think of returning.\n\n\"It is getting very cold, Ida, dear, is it not?\" said she.\n\n\"But where is Mr. O'Brien?\" said Ida.\n\n\"He has fled,--as poltroons always fly,\" said Mrs. Talboys.  I believe in\nmy heart that she would have been glad to have had him there in the\nmiddle of the circle, and to have triumphed over him publicly among us\nall.  No feeling of shame would have kept her silent for a moment.\n\n\"Fled!\" said Ida, looking up into her mother's face.\n\n\"Yes, fled, my child.\"  And she seized her daughter in her arms, and\npressed her closely to her bosom.  \"Cowards always fly.\"\n\n\"Is Mr. O'Brien a coward?\" Ida asked.\n\n\"Yes, a coward, a very coward!  And he has fled before the glance of an\nhonest woman's eye.  Come, Mrs. Mackinnon, shall we go back to the city?\nI am sorry that the amusement of the day should have received this\ncheck.\"  And she walked forward to the carriage and took her place in it\nwith an air that showed that she was proud of the way in which she had\nconducted herself.\n\n\"She is a little conceited about it after all,\" said that unmarried lady.\n\"If poor Mr. O'Brien had not shown so much premature anxiety with\nreference to that little journey to Naples, things might have gone\nquietly after all.\"\n\nBut the unmarried lady was wrong in her judgment.  Mrs. Talboys was proud\nand conceited in the matter,--but not proud of having excited the\nadmiration of her Irish lover.  She was proud of her own subsequent\nconduct, and gave herself credit for coming out strongly as a\nnoble-minded matron.  \"I believe she thinks,\" said Mrs. Mackinnon, \"that\nher virtue is quite Spartan and unique; and if she remains in Rome she'll\nboast of it through the whole winter.\"\n\n\"If she does, she may be certain that O'Brien will do the same,\" said\nMackinnon.  \"And in spite of his having fled from the field, it is upon\nthe cards that he may get the best of it.  Mrs. Talboys is a very\nexcellent woman.  She has proved her excellence beyond a doubt.  But,\nnevertheless, she is susceptible of ridicule.\"\n\nWe all felt a little anxiety to hear O'Brien's account of the matter, and\nafter having deposited the ladies at their homes, Mackinnon and I went\noff to his lodgings.  At first he was denied to us, but after awhile we\ngot his servant to acknowledge that he was at home, and then we made our\nway up to his studio.  We found him seated behind a half-formed model, or\nrather a mere lump of clay punched into something resembling the shape of\na head, with a pipe in his mouth and a bit of stick in his hand.  He was\npretending to work, though we both knew that it was out of the question\nthat he should do anything in his present frame of mind.\n\n\"I think I heard my servant tell you that I was not at home,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, he did,\" said Mackinnon, \"and would have sworn to it too if we\nwould have let him.  Come, don't pretend to be surly.\"\n\n\"I am very busy, Mr. Mackinnon.\"\n\n\"Completing your head of Mrs. Talboys, I suppose, before you start for\nNaples.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say that she has told you all about it,\" and he turned\naway from his work, and looked up into our faces with a comical\nexpression, half of fun and half of despair.\n\n\"Every word of it,\" said I.  \"When you want a lady to travel with you,\nnever ask her to get up so early in winter.\"\n\n\"But, O'Brien, how could you be such an ass?\" said Mackinnon.  \"As it has\nturned out, there is no very great harm done.  You have insulted a\nrespectable middle-aged woman, the mother of a family, and the wife of a\ngeneral officer, and there is an end of it;--unless, indeed, the general\nofficer should come out from England to call you to account.\"\n\n\"He is welcome,\" said O'Brien, haughtily.\n\n\"No doubt, my dear fellow,\" said Mackinnon; \"that would be a dignified\nand pleasant ending to the affair.  But what I want to know is\nthis;--what would you have done if she had agreed to go?\"\n\n\"He never calculated on the possibility of such a contingency,\" said I.\n\n\"By heavens, then, I thought she would like it,\" said he.\n\n\"And to oblige her you were content to sacrifice yourself,\" said\nMackinnon.\n\n\"Well, that was just it.  What the deuce is a fellow to do when a woman\ngoes on in that way.  She told me down there, upon the old race course\nyou know, that matrimonial bonds were made for fools and slaves.  What\nwas I to suppose that she meant by that?  But to make all sure, I asked\nher what sort of a fellow the General was.  'Dear old man,' she said,\nclasping her hands together.  'He might, you know, have been my father.'\n'I wish he were,' said I, 'because then you'd be free.'  'I am free,'\nsaid she, stamping on the ground, and looking up at me as much as to say\nthat she cared for no one.  'Then,' said I, 'accept all that is left of\nthe heart of Wenceslaus O'Brien,' and I threw myself before her in her\npath.  'Hand,' said I, 'I have none to give, but the blood which runs red\nthrough my veins is descended from a double line of kings.'  I said that\nbecause she is always fond of riding a high horse.  I had gotten close\nunder the wall, so that none of you should see me from the tower.\"\n\n\"And what answer did she make?\" said Mackinnon.\n\n\"Why she was pleased as Punch;--gave me both her hands, and declared that\nwe would be friends for ever.  It is my belief, Mackinnon, that that\nwoman never heard anything of the kind before.  The General, no doubt,\ndid it by letter.\"\n\n\"And how was it that she changed her mind?\"\n\n\"Why; I got up, put my arm round her waist, and told her that we would be\noff to Naples.  I'm blest if she didn't give me a knock in the ribs that\nnearly sent me backwards.  She took my breath away, so that I couldn't\nspeak to her.\"\n\n\"And then--\"\n\n\"Oh, there was nothing more.  Of course I saw how it was.  So she walked\noff one way and I the other.  On the whole I consider that I am well out\nof it.\"\n\n\"And so do I,\" said Mackinnon, very gravely.  \"But if you will allow me\nto give you my advice, I would suggest that it would be well to avoid\nsuch mistakes in future.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said O'Brien, excusing himself, \"I don't know what a man\nis to do under such circumstances.  I give you my honour that I did it\nall to oblige her.\"\n\nWe then decided that Mackinnon should convey to the injured lady the\nhumble apology of her late admirer.  It was settled that no detailed\nexcuses should be made.  It should be left to her to consider whether the\ndeed which had been done might have been occasioned by wine, or by the\nfolly of a moment,--or by her own indiscreet enthusiasm.  No one but the\ntwo were present when the message was given, and therefore we were\nobliged to trust to Mackinnon's accuracy for an account of it.\n\nShe stood on very high ground indeed, he said, at first refusing to hear\nanything that he had to say on the matter.  \"The foolish young man,\" she\ndeclared, \"was below her anger and below her contempt.\"\n\n\"He is not the first Irishman that has been made indiscreet by beauty,\"\nsaid Mackinnon.\n\n\"A truce to that,\" she replied, waving her hand with an air of assumed\nmajesty.  \"The incident, contemptible as it is, has been unpleasant to\nme.  It will necessitate my withdrawal from Rome.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mrs. Talboys; that will be making too much of him.\"\n\n\"The greatest hero that lives,\" she answered, \"may have his house made\nuninhabitable by a very small insect.\"  Mackinnon swore that those were\nher own words.  Consequently a sobriquet was attached to O'Brien of which\nhe by no means approved.  And from that day we always called Mrs. Talboys\n\"the hero.\"\n\nMackinnon prevailed at last with her, and she did not leave Rome.  She\nwas even induced to send a message to O'Brien, conveying her forgiveness.\nThey shook hands together with great eclat in Mrs. Mackinnon's\ndrawing-room; but I do not suppose that she ever again offered to him\nsympathy on the score of his matrimonial troubles.\n\n\n\n",
