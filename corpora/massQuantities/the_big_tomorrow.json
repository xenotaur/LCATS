    "body": "He hadn't gotten any work done that morning. He'd spent most of the time\npacing the floor of his small back office, and the rest of it at the\nwindow--hands clasped behind his somewhat bowed back--staring up into\nthe cloudless sky.\n\nAt ten-forty, the intercom buzzed. He snapped the switch.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I've got those figures, Mr. Lake. We have nine--\"\n\n\"Maybe you'd better come in and tell me personally, Lucy.\"\n\n\"All right, Mr. Lake.\"\n\nThe intercom snapped off and a few moments later a girl entered the\noffice--if the prim little wisp that was Lucy Crane could be so\ngenerously classified.\n\nJoshua Lake stared at the elongated bun of black hair on the top of her\nhead as she came toward his desk. There was an odd streak of rich\nimagination in Joshua Lake and he always felt Lucy Crane's bun was a\nsymbol of disapproval. \"Sit down, Lucy. You use up too much energy.\"\n\n\"I try to do my job, Mr. Lake.\"\n\n\"You do that--and more. What are the figures, Lucy?\"\n\n\"We're in desperate shape. We have nine thousand, four hundred and\ntwenty dollars in the payroll account. That leaves it over five thousand\nshort. There is only about two thousand in General Disbursements, but\nthat isn't enough to cover invoices due tomorrow. I'm afraid--\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid, Lucy. That's negative. If we waste our time sitting\naround shivering, we won't make any progress at all.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean it that way, Mr. Lake. I'm not shivering. I was merely\nstating that we haven't got enough money.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go to the bank and get some more.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Lake. Is that all?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's all, Lucy. You run on to lunch.\"\n\n\"You aren't going out?\"\n\n\"No. I'm not hungry today.\"\n\nHer bun bobbed in disapproval as she left the office. Joshua Lake stared\nat the closed door and sighed. Lucy knew exactly how things were. She\nwasn't one to be fooled. But Joshua hoped the rest of the personnel were\nnot so perceptive. The engineers and the draftsmen particularly. They\ncould all walk out at noon and be working somewhere else by one o'clock,\nwhat with the huge current industrial demand.\n\nHe walked again to the window; an old man; bone-weary, with the weight\nof his sixty-odd years bending his shoulders like a brick-carrier's hod.\n\n\"_Then I'll go to the bank and get some more._\" He hadn't even fooled\nhimself this time. His chances at the bank were nil. Less than nil. His\nvery presence there could tip the balance of their decision. Loans could\nbe called; the doors locked before nightfall.\n\nAt the window, he lowered his eyes from the sky and looked to the gate\nthat led into the horseshoe sweep of low buildings and back to the\ngreat, bulking hangar where precious work was being done.\n\nA man and his dream, Lake mused.\n\nHe could see only the back of the sign hanging over the gate, but he was\nquite familiar with the other side. _Lake Interstellar Enterprises_ in\nbold, brave letters; and in the lower right-hand corner--barely\ndiscernible--_Joshua Lake--President_.\n\n\n\nA visitor looking closely at the sign could see that it had been done\nover--that a discarded legend lay beneath a coat of white paint. The old\nname of the firm was still faintly visible: _Lake and Gorman--Castings\nand Extrusions_.\n\nIt wasn't difficult for Joshua to conjure up Lee Gorman's craggy,\nhostile face. Nor his words. Lee had a voice like gravel being ground\nto powder. A voice to remember....\n\n\"Of course I won't go along with this damn-fool idea of yours! Turn a\nperfectly sound, entrenched business into a blue-sky factory? You've\ngone crazy, Joshua.\"\n\n\"But it's feasible, Lee! Entirely feasible. All we need is a little\nimagination. I've investigated. I've hired the best brains in the world.\nI have all the necessary preliminary data. A rocket _can_ be built that\nwill take three men to the Moon and bring them back!\"\n\n\"That's idiocy, Joshua!\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it can be done?\"\n\n\"I don't care whether it can be done or not!\"\n\n\"But open your eyes, man! This is an age of development. An era of\nmovement. We're on the threshold of the big tomorrow, and we can't let\nit pass us by! We can't let the honor and the glory go to others while\nwe sit on our hands and hoot from the gallery! Come alive, Lee! The\nworld is passing us!\"\n\n\"I don't want honor and glory. All I want is a sound going business.\nSuppose we could put a rocket on the Moon and bring it back? Where would\nthat leave us? Broke and famous. And laughed at probably in the\nbargain.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. We could write our own ticket. We'd control the\ngateway to the greatest mineral deposits within reach of Man! Think of\nit, Lee. Use your imagination.\"\n\n\"I won't go along with you, Joshua. That's all there is to it.\"\n\nMore of the same; days of it, and finally: \"You can have the customers\nthen, Lee. I'll keep the plant--the physical properties.\"\n\n\"But that's not fair.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not, but it's legal.\"\n\n\"How can I service them--from my basement?\"\n\n\"I offered you an alternative only a fool would have turned down--\"\n\n\"That only a fool would accept!\"\n\n\"--so now I'm going ahead and nothing can stop me. I've got a dream,\nman--a dream of a big tomorrow. I'm going to make that dream come true.\"\n\n\"Name it right, Joshua. You've got an obsession.\"\n\nThe end of _Lake and Gorman_....\n\nJoshua turned from the window, then paused and looked again into the\nsky. The Moon was up, a round, white will-o'-the-wisp in the clear blue\nafternoon sky. He stared at it and the old feeling of affinity swept\nover him, stronger than ever. The Moon was, for him, both a goal and a\ntonic. Sight of its illusive form could always sweep away his doubts;\nstraighten his shoulders.\n\nThe intercom buzzed. Joshua went over and snapped it. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Mr. Coving to see you, sir.\"\n\n\"Send him in.\"\n\nRayburn Coving was probably the best rocket-fuel man in the world. He\nhad a little of his sandy hair left, not much, and his forehead was\npermanently creased from frowning. \"I'm afraid that new benzoic\nderivative is a failure, Chief. It piles up corrosion in the tubes too\nfast. They'd be clogged halfway through the trip.\"\n\nOne hundred and twenty thousand dollars up the spout. Joshua sighed.\n\"Well, I suppose the chance of success was worth it. The added power in\nrelatively smaller space would have solved so many other problems.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry it failed.\"\n\nJoshua smiled. \"To paraphrase a certain American inventor--we're finding\nany number of ways you can't go to the Moon. What now, Coving?\"\n\n\"Back to the old method--and the other problems. None of them are\ninsurmountable, though. A little more time--\"\n\n\"Yes--a little more time.\" Joshua grimaced inwardly. He was talking to\nCoving as though they had years--not as though their time had run out.\nHe was even in debt for Coving's labor; overdrawn on it without enough\nmoney to pay.\n\nThe moment of weakness--of deep-down weariness--passed. Joshua Lake\nstiffened as he had stiffened so many times before. As he had stiffened\nwhen Zornoff's alloys had flunked out and the first trip to the bank had\nbeen made necessary. The first trip to the bank. Joshua smiled wryly.\nThe bank people had been cordial then. Even servile. Later it had been\ndifferent. Now--\n\n\"You were saying, Mr. Lake--?\"\n\n\"Have you seen Morton lately? What's the latest on the radar relay\nequipment?\"\n\n\"No major bugs, I think. It's coming along famously.\"\n\n\"Good!\" For two hundred odd thousand it certainly should, Joshua felt.\n\"Let me know how you make out, Coving.\"\n\n\"I will, Chief. I'll get the order in for the new chemicals\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Eh--oh, yes. Do that. Do that by all means.\"\n\nCoving left. Joshua Lake put his head against the back rest of the chair\nand closed his eyes. He dozed, drifting into a haze from weariness.\n_It's been so long--so very long. Seven years--eight--ten. Ten years.\nGood heavens! Was it possible? It didn't seem that long. Ten years to\nmake a dream succeed._\n\n_Or fail._\n\nJoshua slept and again--as in the past--his rest was plagued with\nvisions. The torment of his days took many forms in an alert\nsubconscious too taut to relax. He had seen before him mountains too\nsteep to cross--chasms too deep and wide to bridge. Often, when a great\nproblem was solved, he would look back, nights later, to see the\nmountain or the chasm from the other side.\n\nNow his vision was different. No mountain before him, but a face--the\nstern craggy face of an obstacle in his path.\n\nLee Gorman.\n\nThe face was of clay--yet it lived. The eyes were cold, disdainful. And\na weird, green creation of Joshua's own mind was sketching Gorman in the\nnumbers, signs, and symbols of a rocket that would never reach the Moon.\n\nJoshua awoke with a start and found Lucy bending over him. \"You didn't\nanswer the buzzer, Mr. Lake. I was worried.\"\n\n\"I must have dozed off, Lucy. Sorry.\"\n\n\"I'm going home now--if there's nothing else.\"\n\n\"Nothing else. I'm going home myself. Good night.\"\n\nJoshua paused beside his car in the parking lot to stare at the lighted\nwindows of the big hangar. The second shift had come on. They would work\nall night; then, tomorrow, they would line up with the others at the pay\nwindow. But there wouldn't be any money. The next night the hangar\nwindows would be dark.\n\nHe got into the car and drove home.\n\nMyra was waiting for him. She took his hat. After he kissed her, she\nsaid, \"Your eyes are red, dear. You've been working much too hard. Shall\nwe have dinner in the patio?\"\n\n\"That would be nice.\"\n\nJoshua had little to say during the meal, and Myra was quiet\nalso--adjusting herself, as she had always done, to his mood. Finally,\nshe said, \"That will be all, Bertha. Leave the coffee pot.\"\n\nThe maid left. A slight chill was coming in off the desert. Joshua\nshivered and said, \"We're through, Myra.\"\n\n\"Through? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"The Moon trip. I can't swing it. The money's run out. There's no place\nI can raise another dime.\"\n\n\"But you've worked so hard--and so long! And you are so close to\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"We've made a lot of progress, but the rocket isn't ready yet. Now it's\ntoo late.\"\n\nThey were silent for a time. Then Myra said, \"In a way, I'm glad. You\nshould have stopped long ago. You aren't strong enough to stand this\npace forever. Now we can go away--get a small place somewhere. That Moon\nrocket was killing you, Joshua.\"\n\nJoshua pondered the point. \"Killing me? No, I don't think so. I think it\nhas been keeping me alive.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, dear! You make it sound so--so brutal! Year in and\nyear out. Fighting disappointment--failure. Aging before my eyes while I\nsit here night after night!\"\n\n_Fighting disappointment--failure._ Yes. That was the kind of fight it\nhad been. How many failures? The first big one had come six years\nbefore....\n\n\"Acceleration, Monsieur, must be achieved in the first two thousand\nmiles of flight. After that, the speed of the ship remains constant. You\nfollow me?\" Tardeau, the half-mad French genius had explained it so\nlogically. And Joshua had believed in him. That's where you made your\nbig gamble in a project of this kind. You selected your men and then\nbelieved in them. Others dissented, of course. There are always\ndissenters. And always points that could not be proven or disproven on\nthe drawing boards or in the test pits....\n\n\n\n\"I follow you, Henri. The booster units will be in three sections.\"\n\n\"Exactly, Msieu. The primary--ah, booster, as you say, breaks free at\ntwelve miles. That one, and the secondary, we control with radar. We\ntouch a button and Voila! they are free!\"\n\n\"In case of the men in the ship blacking out, I think you said.\"\n\n\"Exactly. But the third will be disengaged from within the ship and she\nwill be free as a bird to fly to your most illusive Moon!\"\n\n\"And the return?\"\n\n\"There we have a much lighter ship, Monsieur. The smaller boosters will\nlift her easily. The return trip will be slower--much slower, but she\nwill return!\"\n\nMichael Bernard was the dissenter. \"The Frenchman's crazy! Mad as a\nhatter, Chief.\"\n\n\"You think it won't work, then?\"\n\n\"Too damn complicated. A dozen units of time and mechanism have to mesh\nperfectly. The odds are against that happening. After all, you've got to\nremember, what we're attempting has never been done before.\"\n\n\"But if it did work--?\"\n\n\"It would be a beauty.\"\n\n\"Better than your idea of a single booster?\"\n\n\"If it worked--yes. The weight problem would be solved. Five men could\nride the rocket. But--\"\n\n\"Let's try it, Mike. Let's believe in our destiny.\"\n\n\"Okay--you're the boss. But destiny's a hard thing to lay out and\nanalyze on a drawing board.\"\n\nA man and his dream....\n\nThe radar equipment had failed. Burdened with the weight of exhausted\nbooster sections, the rocket curved back into the clutches of gravity.\n\nIt crashed on the fringe of the Amazon jungles.\n\nFive Moon pioneers dead. Three uninsured, dependent families. Joshua\nprovided for them, but the critical newspapers overlooked that point.\nOne editorial observed that Joshua Lake would get a rocket to the Moon\nand back if it took every able-bodied man in the country. The project\nwould have died right there if Joshua had needed money. No bank in the\nnation would have loaned him a dime. Fortunately he was not yet broke.\nHe started over.\n\n_Fortunately?_\n\n\n\nAt times he had wondered. But always, his faith had returned to buoy him\nup....\n\nJoshua reached out and took Myra's hand. He looked up into the sky. \"You\nmay be wrong, my dear. Possibly it's the other way. A man's ambition--\"\nhe smiled. \"Lee called it an obsession once. A man's dream can keep him\nalive.\"\n\n\"But why does it have to be so hard? Why can't one of the big\ncorporations help you? They'll profit from your success!\"\n\n\"At least I had no competition in the fulfillment of my dream.\"\n\nThey were silent for a time; then Myra said, \"But now you can rest.\nWe'll go away. We don't need much money. We'll have a garden. You can\nlie in the sun.\"\n\nHe laughed softly; not with humor; rather from a quiet, new-welling\ncourage. \"We're talking as though it were all over--finished, done with.\nThat isn't right.\"\n\nShe glanced at him quickly. \"But you just said--\"\n\n\"I know. But I didn't really mean it that way. We aren't through yet.\"\n\n\"You know where you can raise--more money?\"\n\n\"I know where it is. I'm going to see Lee Gorman tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Lee Gorman! You aren't serious.\"\n\n\"There's no place else to go.\"\n\n\"You'll be wasting your time, Joshua. He'll--he'll humiliate you.\"\n\n\"He probably will. And I may not get the money. But there's no place\nelse to go.\"\n\nTears came into Myra's eyes. \"Don't do it, Joshua. Please don't do it.\"\n\n\"It won't be as bad as you think, dear. I guess Lee is entitled to crow\na little.\"\n\n\n\nLee Gorman looked at the intercom on his desk as though it had snapped\nat him. \"Who?\" he barked. But there had been no mistake. Gorman sat in\npuzzled silence for a few moments. Then he said, \"All right, show him\nin.\"\n\nJoshua Lake entered the office with his hat in one hand and a briefcase\nin the other. He paused halfway to Gorman's desk. \"You haven't changed\nmuch, Lee.\"\n\n\"You have,\" Gorman answered. \"You look like the devil.\"\n\n\"I've been working hard.\" Joshua Lake covered the intervening distance\nand stood before the desk. Gorman surveyed him coldly--up and down.\nJoshua looked around the office as Gorman sat silent, not inviting him\nto sit down.\n\n\"You've done very well, Lee. This is the first time I've seen your\nplant.\"\n\n\"I've expanded a little since my basement days. You remember my basement\ndays, don't you Joshua?\"\n\nJoshua winced. \"Yes, I remember.\"\n\n\"And now you might tell me the purpose of this visit.\"\n\n\"I came to you because I need money.\"\n\nGorman's eyes snapped open--wide. He opened his mouth to speak. He\nfailed, tightened his throat and tried again. \"You came here after\n_what_?\"\n\n\"Money. I'm broke, Lee. I haven't enough to meet my payroll.\"\n\n\"You expect me to bail you out--clean up your debts--put you clear?\"\n\n\"I came after more than that. Merely bailing me out wouldn't help a bit.\nI need three hundred thousand to put my rocket in the air.\"\n\nGorman collapsed gently back into his chair like a balloon mercifully\nrelieved of some of its content. When he spoke, it was with a slow,\ncontrolled viciousness. \"I've heard of guts, Joshua. I've heard of\ngall--plain unmitigated nerve. But this tops anything--why, man, you\nthrew me out! You robbed me! You left me standing in the street with a\nbookful of names and addresses under my arm--nothing more. Now you come\nhere and ask for money!\"\n\n\"I'm glad you've done well, Lee. There was nothing personal in what I\ndid. I'm glad you've gone on to even bigger things than we would have\nachieved together.\"\n\n\"You're glad I've done well! Why, you pious hypocrite! I ought to have\nyou thrown through the window instead of merely ordering you out!\"\n\n\"There is no reason why I should expect any better treatment, Lee. But I\nhad to come here. You were my last hope. I had to ask.\"\n\nJoshua turned slowly from the desk. He had taken but three steps when\nLee Gorman said, \"Wait a minute. I'm curious. Are you _really_ still at\nit--beating your brains out against that stone wall?\"\n\n\"It's my dream, Lee. I've got to be the first man to put a rocket on the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"But now you're broke--washed up. What's with the dream now?\"\n\n\"I guess it's finished.\" Joshua turned and took another step; but Gorman\nwas loath to let him go.\n\n\"Tell me,\" Gorman said. \"What have you got in that briefcase?\"\n\n\"Progress reports. Plans. I wanted to show them to you.\"\n\nGorman grinned. \"All right. I've got a few minutes. Come and do it.\"\n\nJoshua Lake retraced his steps. He sat down in a chair next to Gorman's\ndesk. He laid his hat on the desk and snapped open the case.\n\n\"No,\" Gorman said. \"Stand here by my elbow. The chair is for people I\nmeet on even terms.\"\n\nJoshua got obediently to his feet and placed himself as directed.\n\n\"And your hat,\" Gorman added. \"You'd better hold that. You might forget\nit when you leave.\"\n\n\"Of course, Lee.\"\n\nIt was a ludicrous, pitiful sight but, withal, a grim note ran through\nthe scene. Joshua supporting the case against his thigh, got out a sheaf\nof papers. \"These are the progress reports to date. These, the projected\nplans.\"\n\n\"And when these plans are carried out you expect success?\"\n\n\"Yes. Great foresight has been used. They will carry us through.\"\n\n\"And you expect me to loan you money on the strength of this--this\nday-dreaming on paper?\"\n\n\"It's far more than that, Lee. You'll find the plans sound.\"\n\nLee Gorman didn't give a tinker's hoot for the plans. He was only\nenjoying an interview--a vengeance--he was loath to terminate. \"You\nhaven't even begun to show me what I'd need before I even considered\nloaning you a dime.\"\n\n\"I'll bring you anything you want.\"\n\n\"Even if I promise to turn you down after I've gone over it.\"\n\n\"You're calling the dance, Lee.\"\n\n\"All right--I'll call it. Bring me your payroll records; your cost\nsheets; the background reports on the key men in your organization.\"\n\n\"As soon as I can get them. I need some money immediately to meet my\npayroll.\"\n\n\"Then what are you waiting for?\"\n\n\"I'll be back this afternoon.\" Joshua was halfway out the door when Lee\nGorman called. \"And bring the deeds to your plant--the bills of sale to\nyour machinery and equipment.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nJoshua left and Lee Gorman sat motionless staring at the surface of his\ndesk. There was a Mona Lisa smile on his rugged face.\n\n\n\n\"It's not worth it, Joshua,\" Myra said, hotly. \"You won't be able to\ntake his brow-beating and badgering day after day. And that's his\nintention. That's what he's giving you the money for--for the pleasure\nof humiliating you day after day.\"\n\n\"Of course, my dear. I'm fortunate that Lee is that kind of a man. He\nwants his revenge and he's willing to pay for it. I was hoping it would\nbe that way--praying for it. It was my last weapon. The last weapon I\nhad with which to beat the Moon.\"\n\nA man and his dream....\n\n\"I want you to sign these papers, Joshua.\" Lee Gorman held out a pen and\npushed the papers across the desk.\n\n\"Certainly, Lee.\"\n\n\"Four copies.\"\n\nJoshua pushed the papers back, looked at them and smiled.\n\n\"Do you know what you signed?\"\n\n\"A power of attorney, I believe. And I've signed the plant over to you.\nThere is a large mortgage against it, however.\"\n\nLee Gorman sat back, narrowed his eyes as he looked at the wizened\nlittle man with the giant obsession. \"Joshua, I think you've worked\nbeyond your time. You've slipped your gears completely. Do you realize\nthat with these papers I can put you in the street? That all I have to\ndo is raise my hand and you're done?\"\n\n\"I realize that, Lee.\"\n\n\"Then why on earth did you sign them?\"\n\n\"I had no alternative.\"\n\n\"But what kind of an alternative is this? Giving away everything you've\ngot?\"\n\nJoshua sighed. \"You haven't raised your hand yet, Lee. I can surmount my\ndifficulties only as I come to them. I'll think about that one when it\ngets here.\"\n\n\"Well--I've got news for you. The time to think about it is--\" Gorman\nstopped in mid-sentence. He studied Joshua Lake for a long minute. Then\nhe took a checkbook from his desk and wrote rapidly. \"There's money to\nmeet your payroll. The exact amount. Take it to the bank. Then, I want\nyou in this office every day at four-thirty with a complete report of\nwhat's gone on. Don't overlook a thing. And bring any bills with you\nthat want paying, together with material orders and projected costs. Is\nthat clear?\"\n\n\"I understand, Lee.\" At the door, Joshua Lake turned for a moment.\n\"And--thank you--thank you very much.\"\n\nAfter Joshua had left, Lee Gorman pondered one of those last words. If\nthey contained any bitterness, it was well hidden. \"A strange man,\"\nGorman muttered. \"A very strange man.\"\n\nIf that constituted a weak moment on the part of Lee Gorman, his dikes\nwere repaired well in time to present a hostile front....\n\n\"This twelve thousand to American Chemical--what are you doing--running\nan experimental laboratory on the side. I won't pay it.\"\n\n\"I've never questioned Coving's judgment in these matters, Lee. He's\ndone brilliant work for us. The man has to have materials to work\nwith.\"\n\n\"Well, you certainly should have questioned him. He's been satisfying\nevery whim of curiosity that pops into his mind. Send the stuff back.\"\n\n\"But that would be fatal to the project. The fuel _must_ be\npower-charged to safely handle the weight and time quotients. Coving\ncan't work with salt and baking soda.\"\n\n\"I don't care what he works with. Cut three thousand off that bill.\"\n\n\"Very well, Lee.\"\n\nA man and his dream....\n\n\"This payroll's out of all reason. Cut fifteen men off immediately.\"\n\n\"I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\"Cut fifteen men off immediately.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Here's a check for the interest on the last note. Take it over to the\nbank.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lee.\"\n\nJoshua Lake came and went as directed. He stood with his hat in his\nhand, took orders, carried them out. His shoulders drooped a little\nmore; his face became more pinched; he retreated deeper and deeper into\nhimself.\n\nBut as the days went on, his eyes brightened and there was a\nbreathlessness in his expression when he turned his face to the sky.\n\nSome three months after the day Joshua walked into Lee's office, the\nlatter said, \"The four men who are going with the rocket. You've\nselected them?\"\n\n\"Yes. They're waiting for the day. It was a long slow process, selecting\nthe best equipped men.\"\n\n\"Bring them here tomorrow afternoon.\"\n\n\"I'll check with them. If they all can't make it, would a later date--?\"\n\n\"I said tomorrow. See to it they _can_ make it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lee.\"\n\nJoshua brought the four young men to Lee Gorman's office the following\nday. Lee had a buffet table set up. He was the smiling, genial,\nexpansive host. \"Sit down gentlemen. I'm glad of this opportunity to\nmeet you.\"\n\nThere were five chairs in the room. Gorman had already seated himself.\nThe young men hesitated.\n\n\"Sit down, sit down.\"\n\nThey dropped into the chairs, glancing uneasily at Joshua Lake. Joshua\nturned and started toward the door.\n\n\"Don't go, Lake. I'm sure the boys would like a drink. You'll find the\nfixings on the buffet. Why don't you take their orders?\"\n\nThe crowning insult, Joshua wondered. The last, crude insult? Lee\nGorman's wounds must have been deep indeed. Joshua served drinks,\nbrought sandwiches. Lee Gorman's geniality kept the awkwardness of the\nsituation from bringing it to a complete standstill. \"Well, Thursday is\nthe day, I understand. How do you feel about it? Rocketing off into\nspace. Becoming a part of the big tomorrow.\" Gorman's eyes caught those\nof Joshua Lake as he spoke the last sentence. There was laughter behind\nthem.\n\nThe crew of the Moon rocket left shortly afterward. Joshua was the last\nto walk from the room. Just as he was going through the door, Lee Gorman\nwhispered into his ear. \"You can't be sure there'll be a rocket flight.\nI might stop it the last minute. I haven't made up my mind yet.\"\n\nJoshua turned and looked at his tormentor in silence. The others had\ngone on down the hall. Gorman laughed and said, \"I suppose that's a\nproblem you'll face when you come to it?\"\n\n\"Yes--when I come to it.\"\n\nAlone in his office, Lee Gorman strode angrily to the buffet. With a\nsweep of his arm, he knocked a liquor bottle across the room. The\nmotivation of the act was hard to determine, however, from Gorman's\noutward appearance. It could have been bitter disappointment or a\nfierce joy.\n\n\n\nJoshua Lake walked into Lee Gorman's office, removed his hat and said,\n\"With your permission, this is the day.\"\n\n\"What time?\"\n\n\"It translates into 4:07 and 30 seconds, Greenwich time.\"\n\nGorman scowled. \"I suppose you've arranged quite a party.\"\n\n\"Nothing too spectacular. We'll leave for the blasting pits at 3:00\no'clock. I'd be honored if you'd ride with me.\"\n\n\"Do you still own a car?\"\n\n\"A small one. Its value is negligible.\"\n\n\"We'll go in one of mine. Be here at five minutes to three.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" Joshua put his hat on and walked out....\n\nThey rode across the Nevada desert in a black Cadillac with the\nchauffeur sitting at attention and staring straight ahead. Joshua stared\nstraight ahead also. He asked, \"Are you going to stop the flight?\"\n\nBeside him, leaning forward, clutching with both hands the silver knob\non a black mahogany cane, Gorman replied, \"I haven't made up my mind\nyet.\"\n\nA dot on the desert expanded into a pit, a tower, and some small\nbuildings. The car followed the ruts of the tractors that had hauled the\nrocket to the launching site, and came to a halt. \"That small,\nglass-encased platform,\" Joshua said. \"We'll view the proceedings from\nthere.\"\n\nGorman snorted. \"I'll view them from where I please.\"\n\nThey were standing beside the car, Joshua slightly behind his\nbenefactor. \"From the platform.\"\n\nGorman scowled and half turned. \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm holding a gun against your back. It is a very small gun. No one can\nsee it and it probably wouldn't kill you. Then again, it might. We will\nwalk to the platform and stand together to watch the blast-off.\"\n\n\"You'd actually--_kill_, to get that ship into the air?\"\n\n\"If I committed murder, I would certainly regret it the rest of my life,\nbut the rocket must be launched.\"\n\nThey stood in the glass enclosure on the platform and no one came near\nthem. Several people veered close and waved. Joshua waved back with his\nfree hand and the people went on their way.\n\nAn hour passed. There was vast activity on the field. Gorman said, \"I'm\ntired. I want to sit down.\"\n\n\"It was thoughtless of me. I should have provided chairs. It won't be\nlong now.\"\n\nIt wasn't long. Five minutes later there was a roar, an explosion of\ncolor, and a silver rocket flash up into the sky almost faster than the\neye could follow.\n\nGorman slammed the heel of his hand against the side of his head in\norder to restore hearing. \"You can put that gun away.\"\n\n\"Of course. And you'll want to call the police.\"\n\nGorman growled like an annoyed bull. He jerked open the door and strode\naway.\n\nThree hours later, Joshua and Myra Lake were seated in the small patio\nbeside their home. They were seated very close together, and Myra was\nstroking Joshua's hand. \"It's been a long time, dear; a very long time.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"I'm--well, satisfied--at least partially. We've passed a big milestone.\nBut it isn't over yet.\"\n\n\"You're sure this time, though?\"\n\n\"Very sure.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven we won't have much longer to wait.\"\n\nThe wait was slightly less than ten minutes. Then Lee Gorman strode into\nthe patio. Joshua sprang to his feet. \"Any news?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then they should have phoned me. I left word to be called.\"\n\n\"No one could get up the courage. The rocket crashed in Canada.\"\n\nJoshua swayed. When he looked at Lee, his eyes were filled with a mute\nplea. \"That _is_ the truth?\"\n\n\"It's the truth. The first flash said it appears the tail broke off in\nhigh space.\"\n\nJoshua sank into his chair. \"The crew--died?\"\n\n\"Four more men sacrificed to your--\" Gorman stopped and did not use the\nword _obsession_. There was too much agony in Joshua's face. \"I'm taking\nthe plant--I'm taking everything. I've got to. I've paid for them.\"\n\nLee Gorman walked from the patio. His steps echoed and died.\n\nJoshua and Myra sat for a long time in silence. Myra was holding his\nhand. Finally she spoke. \"Well, at least it's over. Now you can rest.\nSuccessful or not--you've earned it.\"\n\nJoshua turned and looked into her face--looked at her as though she had\njust entered. \"Oh no, my dear. You certainly don't expect me to--\"\n\n\"Joshua!\"\n\n\"Why, I'm only sixty-three. I never felt better in my life. I have a lot\nof good productive years ahead.\"\n\n\"_Joshua! What are you going to do?_\"\n\n\"I'm going to be the first man to send a rocket to the Moon.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
