MCMVII\n\nCopyright 1904 by The Century Co.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nIf you take a pie and cut it in two, the track of your knife will\nrepresent the course of Mud River through the town of Gloning, and that\npart of the pie to the left of your knife will be the East Side, while\nthe part to the right will be the West Side. Away out on the edge of the\npie, where the town fritters away into the fields and shanties on the\nEast Side, dwells Mrs. Deacon, and a fatter, better-natured creature\nnever trod the crust of the earth or made the crust of a pie. Being\nin reduced circumstances, owing to the inability of Mr. Deacon to\nappreciate the beneficial effects of work, Mrs. Deacon turned her\nfamous baking ability to account, and in a small way began selling her\nexcellent homemade pies to those who liked a superior article. In\ntime Mrs. Deacon established a considerable trade among the people of\nGloning, and Mr. Deacon was wrested from his customary seat on the back\nsteps to make daily delivery trips with the Deacon home-made pies.\n\nEphraim Deacon was a deep thinker and philosopher. He was above his\nenvironment, or at least he felt so, and while waiting for opportunity\nto approach and give his talents full vent he scorned labor. So he sat\naround a good deal, and jawed a good deal, and smoked.\n\nBut if you will return to your plate of Gloning you will see on the pie,\nfar over on the West Side, where the scallops lap over the edge of the\nplate, a little spot that is burned a bit too brown. This is the home\nof Mrs. Phineas Doolittle, as base and servile an imitator as ever\ninfringed on another person's monopoly. For, seeing and hearing of the\nsuccess of Mrs. Deacon's pies, Mrs. Doolittle put a few extra pieces of\nhickory in her stove, got out her rolling-pin, and became a competitor,\neven to making Mr. Doolittle deliver her pies. The Deacon pies had sold\nreadily at ten cents; three for a quarter. The Doolittle pie entered the\nfield at eight cents; three for twenty cents.\n\nMrs. Deacon stood this as long as possible, and then she decided to\nstand it no longer--unless she had to. \u201cEph, you good-for-nothin' lazy\nanimal,\u201d she remarked to her husband one morning, as she started him\non his rounds, \u201cif you was a man, I'd send you over to talk to that\nDoolittle woman; but you ain't, so it ain't no use sendin' you. But if\nyou meet up with that lazy, good-for-nothin' husband of hers, you give\nhim a piece o' my mind, an' let him know what I think o' them what\ncomes stealin' away my business, an' breakin' down prices, which I don't\nwonder at, her pies not bein' in the same class as mine, as everybody\nknows. If you was any good, you'd mash his head in for him, just to show\nher what I think of them. But there! Like as not, if you do catch up\nwith him, you two will sit an' gossip like two old grannies, which is\nall you are good for, either of you.\u201d\n\nBeing thus admonished, Eph Deacon set forth to deliver his pies.\n\nAs he reached the bridge over Mud River, Phinny Doolittle, with a basket\nof pies on each arm, started to cross the bridge from the opposite side,\nand the two men--if Mrs. Deacon will allow me--met in the middle of the\nbridge, and with a common impulse put down their baskets and wiped their\nbrows.\n\n\u201cHowdy, Phin! Blame hot day to-day, hey?\u201d remarked Eph.\n\n\u201cHowdy! Howdy, Eph!\u201d replied Phineas; \u201c'tis so--some smatterin' o'\nwarmth in the air, ain't it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno as I know if I ever knew one much hotter,\u201d said Eph. \u201cHow's the\npie business over your way?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now,\u201d said Phin, \u201c't ain't what you'd call good, nor't ain't what\nyou'd call bad. I dunno what I _would_ call it, unless I'd call it 'bout\nfair to middlin'. How's it over your way?\u201d\n\n\u201c'Well,\u201d Eph said, \u201cI dunno. I ain't got no real cause to complain, I\nreckon; but it does seem as if prices on pies was gittin' too low to\nmake it worth while fer a man to keep his woman over a hot stove a day\nlike this. It don't seem right fer folks to break into business an' cut\nthe liver out of prices.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, now, Eph!\u201d Phin expostulated, \u201cyou ain't got no just cause fer to\nsay that. A man's got to do something to git started, ain't he?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we're goin' to fight this out,\u201d said Eph, calmly, \u201cI move we adjourn\nover yon into the shade an' set down to it. This ain't no question fer\nto settle in no two shakes of a ram's tail, Phineas, an' we mought as\nwell settle it right now an' git shet of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dassay you're right in that, Eph,\u201d Phineas agreed; \u201can' we'll jest\nkite over yonder an' set down an' figure the whole blame business out,\nso 's we won't have to bother about it no more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nWhen the two men were comfortably settled in the shade and had lighted\ntheir pipes, Eph, as the senior in the trade and the party with a\ncomplaint, opened his mouth to speak; but before the words came forth,\nPhineas outflanked him and let fly a thunderbolt.\n\n\u201cEph,\u201d he said, \u201cyou got to lower down your pie prices to even up with\nwhat mine are.\u201d\n\nEph looked at his companion in astonishment.\n\n\u201cLower down my prices!\u201d he ejaculated. \u201cYou be crazy, Phin; plum crazy!\nDon't I give a bigger pie an' a better pie than what you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d remarked Phineas, with a sly twinkle in his eye, \u201chow do\nyou reckon I can h'ist my prices up any? Mebby you think I can git ten\ncents fer a small, mean pie whiles you ask ten cents fer a big, good\none? My idee is that if we want to run along nice an' smooth, an' not\nhave no trouble, what we want to do is to git together an' go in\ncahoots, an' then it don't make no difference what we sell at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm ag'in' trusts,\u201d said Eph, coldly.\n\n\u201cSo'm I,\u201d said Phineas. \u201cWho said anything about trusts? All we want\nis to even things up a bit. Fust thing you know, you'll git mad an'\ncut your prices down to eight cents, an' I'll have to drop to six; an'\nyou'll come to six, an' I'll go to four; an' you'll go to four, an' I'll\nsell pies at two; an' you'll put your pies down to two cents, an'\nblame my hide if I don't give pies away. Dog me if I don't!\u201d\n\nEph looked worried. \u201cOh, come now, Phin,\u201d he said anxiously, \u201cyou won't\nup an' do that, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDog me if I don't!\u201d Phin repeated stubbornly.\n\nEph arose and shook his fist at Phineas.\n\n\u201cYou old ijit!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI'll teach ye!\u201d And bending over, he seized\na large, soft pie and slapped it down over the head of the seated\nPhineas. In a moment the two men were standing face to face, fists\nclenched, and breath coming short and fast, each waiting for the other\nto strike the first blow.\n\nBut neither struck. Eph's eyes fell to Phineas's shoulder, where a large\nfragment of pie had lodged. Phineas moved slightly and the pie fragment\nwavered, tottered, and--Eph reached out his hand quickly to catch it,\nand Phineas dodged and, closing in, grasped him around the waist and\npulled down. Eph sank upon his knees and Phineas followed him, and the\ntwo men, nose to nose, eye to eye, looked at each other and grinned.\n\n\u201cIf we're goin' to fight this thing out,\u201d said Eph, \u201clet's go over in\nthe shade an' set down. It's too blame hot fer wrastlin'.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n\u201cI reckon you see now how your plan would work out,\u201d said Phineas; \u201cwe'd\ngive away nigh on to a thousand pies, an' all because we didn't use hoss\nsense. I'm ag'in' trusts, same as you. I'd vote any day to down any o'\nthem big fellers, but a little private agreement between gentlemen don't\nhurt nobody. What I say is, git together an' fix on a fair price an'\nstick to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJest what I say,\u201d said Eph. \u201cYou lift your price up to ten cents--\u201d\n\n\u201cNever in this green world,\u201d said Phineas. \u201cContrariwise, you drop\nyour grade of pie down equal to mine, an' put your price down to eight\ncents.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so long as I live!\u201d said Eph.\n\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d said Phineas, \u201cit stands this way. If we leave our prices\nas they be, it means fight an' loss to us both, an' we won't change em,\nso what's to be done?\u201d Eph looked out over the river gloomily.\n\n\u201cDog me if I know,\u201d he sighed. \u201cThere's just one thing,\u201d said Phineas.\n\u201cWe got to form a stock company, you an' me, an' put all our earnings\ntogether, an' then, every so often, divide up even. Then if I sell more\npies because mine are eight cents, you'll git your half of all I sell;\nan' if you sell more because your pies are bigger an' better, I'll get\nmy share of what you sell. An' when things git goin' all right, we'll\nraise up the price all around--say, my pies to ten cents an' yours to\ntwelve; an' bein' in cahoots, there won't be nobody to say we sha'n't do\nit, an' we'll lay aside that extra profit to build up the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhineas,\u201d said Eph, solemnly, \u201cit's a wonder I didn't think o' that\nmyself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAin't it, now?\u201d asked Phineas. \u201cBut I 've give this thing some thought,\nan' I ain't begun to tell you where it ends. I wanted to see how you\ntook to it before I let it all out on you.\u201d\n\nEph leaned forward eagerly. \u201cGo on,\u201d he said. \u201cLet it out on me now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the only two homemade pie-makers git together like we'll be,\u201d said\nPhineas, triumphantly, \u201cI'd like to know who'll stop us from liftin'\nup the price. Huh! Them that don't like to pay our prices, they can eat\nbakers' pies an' welcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know some folks in this town,\u201d Eph said, \u201cthat wouldn't eat bakers'\npies if they had to pay twenty-five cents apiece for homemade.\u201d He\npaused to consider this pregnant statement, and then added: \u201cBut I\nreckon the bakers would git away a heap of our trade if we begun liftin'\nour prices much.\u201d Phineas's eyes snapped.\n\n\u201cThey would, hey?\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cMebby they would an' mebby they\nwouldn't. What do you suppose we'd be doin' with that surplus we'd\naccumulate? Come strawberry season, we'd up an' buy every strawberry\nthat come to Gloning. We'd pay more than anybody could afford to, an'\nadd the difference to our strawberry-pie price, because we'd have the\nonly strawberry pies in town. An' what strawberries we couldn't use\nright off we'd can for winter pies. An' as other fruits come in,\nwe'd buy them up the same way. But we wouldn't be mean. We'd open a\nfruit-store an' sell folks fruit at a good high price if they'd sign an\nagreement not to use any fer pie. An' in a little while the bakers would\ngit sick an' sell out their shops to us fer almost nothin'. An' then\nwe'd go into the bakin' business big.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe'd bake cakes an' bread then,\u201d said Eph, eagerly.\n\n\u201cCakes an' bread an' doughnuts an' buns an' everything,\u201d said Phineas,\nwith enthusiasm. \u201cWe'll git one big bake-shop an' save on expenses, an'\nshove up the price of stuff a little, an' just coin money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe'd ought to git at it quick,\u201d said Eph. \u201cWe'd oughtn't to waste no\ntime. What do you reckon would be a good name fer the company?\u201d\n\n\u201cI've fixed that all up,\u201d said Phineas. \u201cWe'll call it the American Pie\nCompany, Incorporated; an' bein' as only you an' me will be in it, we'll\neach have to be officers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm goin' to be president,\u201d exclaimed Eph, with all the eagerness of a\nboy.\n\n\u201cAll right, Eph,\u201d said Phineas. \u201cWe don't want to have no more fights,\nan' I want to do what's right, so you can be president. I'll be\ntreasurer.\u201d\n\nEph thought for a minute. He knew Phineas well.\n\n\u201cI want to do what's right, too,\u201d he said at last. \u201cYou can be\npresident. I'll be treasurer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess mebby we'd better take turns bein' treasurer,\u201d suggested\nPhineas.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Eph; \u201cI want my turn first.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nWhen the two men had settled the treasurer question, they smoked awhile\nin silence, each lost in thought; and as they thought their brows\nclouded.\n\n\u201cSay, Eph,\u201d said Phineas at length, \u201cwhat be you thinkin' that makes you\nlook so glum?\u201d Eph shook his head sadly.\n\n\u201cI been lookin' ahead, Phin,\u201d he said--\u201c'way ahead. An' I see a snag.\nI don't hold it ag'in' you, Phin; but the thing won't pan out.\u201d\n \u201cWhat--what you run up ag'in', Eph?\u201d asked Phineas, solicitously.\n\n\u201cFruit,\u201d said Eph, dolefully. \u201cLoads of it. Phin, what if we _do_ gather\nin all the fruit that comes to town? Ain't there just dead loads an'\nloads o' fruit in these here United States? An' the minute we git to\nputtin' up the price, it'll git noised about, an' Dagos an' Guinnies'll\npile in here with fruit an' cut under us.\u201d He sighed. \u201c'Twas a good\nbusiness while it lasted, Phin; but it didn't last long.\u201d Phineas lay\nback on the grass and laughed long and squeakily.\n\n\u201cIs _that_ all the farther ahead you looked, Eph Deacon?\u201d he asked when\nhe had recovered his breath. \u201cAny old fool ought to know that the second\nyear we was in business we'd buy up all the fruit in the United States.\u201d\n\nEph's face cleared and he smiled again, but Phineas's face clouded.\n\n\u201cWhat worried me, Eph,\u201d he said, \u201cwas 'bout payin' sich high prices\nfor fruit as them blame farmers would likely ask. Ner I won't stand it,\nneither. Will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot by a blame sight, Phin,\u201d said Eph. \u201cI won't let nobody downtrod me.\nBut,\u201d he asked anxiously, \u201chow you goin' to stop it?\u201d\n\nPhineas dug his heel in the soft turf.\n\n\u201cWe got to buy out the farms,\u201d he announced decisively, \u201can' hire the\nfarmers to run 'em.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink we can afford it, Phin?\u201d asked Eph. \u201cWe don't want to go puttin'\nour money into nothin' losing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got to afford it,\u201d said Phin. \u201cWe're in this thing so deep now we\ncan't go back. An' we'll need part o' the farms, anyhow, fer our wheat.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur wheat?\u201d said Eph, puzzled. \u201cBe we goin' to sell wheat, Phin?\u201d\n\n\u201cSell wheat?\u201d said Phin, with disgust. \u201cNo such fools. Won't we need all\nthe wheat this country can grow to keep our big flourmills rannin'? When\nwe own all the flour-mills in the country, it stands to reason we'll\nhave to own all the wheat, don't it?\u201d\n\nEph looked at his companion with open mouth.\n\n\u201cMills!\u201d he ejaculated. \u201cWhat fer do we want to own all the mills?\u201d\n\nPhineas waved his hand in the air.\n\n\u201c'Tain't 'want to,'\u201d he said decisively, \u201cit's 'have to.' I didn't say\nwe'd buy all the mills, because I thought you'd surely see fer yourself\nthat we'd have to buy them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, I ain't kickin', Phin,\u201d said Eph, in a conciliating tone;\n\u201cif you say buy the mills, we'll buy 'em. I'm ready an' willin' any time\nyou are. All I ask is, Why? That's all I ask--Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d explained Phineas, \u201cif our bakery here puts up the price of\nbread, the outside bakeries will ship in bread, if we don't buy out the\noutside bakeries. An' once we start, we've got to buy out every bakery\nin the country. An' when we do that we've got to own all the mills, so\nno one else can get any flour to start bakin'. An' to keep anybody else\nfrom startin' mills, we've got to own all the wheat-belt. It's only\nright to be on the safe side, Eph.\u201d Eph crossed his knees and smoked\nsilently, nodding his head slowly the while.\n\n\u201cI dassay you're right, Phin,\u201d he admitted at length; \u201cbut you ain't\nfar-seein' enough. S'pose--just s'pose, fer instance--it come time to\nship a lot o' flour from our mills to our bakeries, an' them lumber\nfellers up North wouldn't furnish timber to supply our barrel-factories.\u201d\n\nPhineas laughed.\n\n\u201cWe'd use sacks,\u201d he said shortly.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Eph, \u201cs'pose--just s'pose, fer instance--that 'bout the\ntime we needed cotton to run our cloth-mills to make sacks fer our\nflour--\u201d He paused. \u201cWe would run our own cloth-mills, wouldn't we,\nPhin?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cSurely, surely,\u201d replied Phineas.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d continued Eph. \u201cS'pose them cotton-growers down South\nan' them timber-growers up North wouldn't let us have no cotton or no\ntimber. What then?\u201d\n\nPhineas nodded that he comprehended the wisdom of the deduction.\n\n\u201cYou're right, Eph,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican Pie has got to buy out the\ntimber-belt an' the cotton-belt. I'm glad you thought of it. It shows\nyou take an interest in the business, even if you did interrup' me when\nI was thinkin' on a mighty important point.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's that?\u201d asked Eph. \u201cWe got to buy out the railroads,\u201d said\nPhineas. \u201cOnce we own them, we can get proper freight rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cAin't you afraid mebby some of them foreign countries 'll ship in flour\nor fruit or crackers?\u201d asked Eph.\n\n\u201cHow can they when we put the tariff up, like we will?\u201d asked Phineas.\n\u201cCourse, while we're buyin' up these other things, we've got to buy up\nCongress.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhin!\u201d exclaimed Eph, suddenly, \u201cwe'll have a dickens of a tax-bill to\npay.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe'll swear off our taxes,\u201d said Phineas, shortly.\n\nEph relapsed into meditation. \u201cWhy, Phin,\u201d he said at length, \u201cwe'll\nbe as good as bosses of these United States, won't we?\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely we will,\u201d Phin replied.\n\n\u201cDo you suppose I'm doin' all this work an' takin' all this worry just\nfer the money? What do I care fer a few millions more or less, Eph, when\nI've got millions an' millions? What I want is power. I want to have\nthis here nation so that when I say, 'Come!' it will come, an' when I\nsay, 'Go!' it will go, an' when I say, 'Dance!' it will dance.\u201d\n\nHe stood up and inflated his thin breast, and tapped it with his\nforefinger.\n\n\u201cEph,\u201d he said, \u201cwith this here American Pie Company goin', you an' me\ncan go an' say to them big trust men, 'Eat dirt,' an' they'll eat it an'\nbe glad to git off so easy. We can--\u201d\n\nHe paused and glanced up the road uneasily. He shaded his eyes and\nlooked closely at the distant figure of a stout woman who was waddling\nin their direction.\n\n\u201cSkip!\u201d he exclaimed; \u201chere comes your wife!\u201d\n\nEph rolled over and made a dash on his hands and knees for his basket of\npies. Phineas was already walking rapidly up the road.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nThe stout woman was not Mrs. Deacon. She turned off the street before\nthe truant pie-men had gone many steps, and they returned to the grass\nbeside the bridge. For some reason they were not so jubilantly hopeful.\n\n\u201cDog it!\u201d said Eph, as they seated themselves in the shade, \u201cI wish t'\ngoodness I hadn't mashed that pie on you, Phin. I don't know what on\nearth I'm goin' to say to her about it. She's pesky stingy with her pies\nthese days.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame way up to my house,\u201d said Phineas; \u201cbut that'll all be different\nwhen we get the American Pie Company goin'. I guess we'll likely have\npie every day then, hey? An' not have nobody's nails in our hair,\nneither.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeakin' of nails,\u201d said Eph, but not enthusiastically, \u201cthink we'd\nbetter make our own nails. We'll need a lot of 'em, to crate up pies an'\nbread to ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Phineas; \u201can' we'll just take over the steel business while\nwe're about. We'll have a department to do buildin'; there ain't any use\npayin' other folks a big profit to build our mills, an' we might as\nwell do buildin' fer other folks. An' we'll need steel rails fer our\nrailroads.\u201d\n\nEph began to grow enthusiastic again.\n\n\u201cWe'd ought to build our own mines, too,\u201d he suggested.\n\n\u201cAn' run our own stores to sell our bread an' pies in every town,\u201d said\nPhin.\n\n\u201cAn' our own cannin' factories to can our fruit,\u201d said Eph.\n\n\u201cAn' our own can-factories to make the cans,\u201d added Phin.\n\n\u201cWe'll have our own tin-an' iron-mines, of course,\u201d said Eph. \u201cAn' our\nown printin'-shops fer labels an' advertisin' an' showbills.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter buy out the magazines an' newspapers. We can use 'em,\u201d said\nPhin.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d agreed Eph, \u201can' have our own paper-mills.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Phineas, \u201cthere's good money in all them. We'll make\nmore than them that's runnin' of 'em now. We'll economize on help.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's right,\u201d said Eph. \u201cBy consolidatin' we can do away with\none-third of the help. We'll have a whoppin' big pay-roll as it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Phineas, \u201cyou've got to pay fair wages where you have to\ndepend on your help.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair wages is all right,\u201d said Eph; \u201cbut nowadays they want the whole\nhog. You don't hear of nothin' but labor unions an' strikes. If you an'\nme put our money into a big thing like American Pie, we take all the\nrisk and then the laborin' men want all the profits. It ain't square.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it ain't,\u201d said Phineas. \u201cAn' if you don't pay them more than you\ncan afford they strike right at your busiest time. They could put us out\nof business in one year. First the farmers would strike at harvest, an'\nall our fruit an' wheat would go to rot. Then the flour-mill hands\nwould strike an' the wheat get wormy an' no good. Then the bakers would\nstrike, an' no bread in the country--we'd most likely be lynched by the\nmobs.\u201d\n\nEph thought deeply for a while, and the more he thought the more doleful\nhe became.\n\n\u201cPhineas,\u201d he said, at length, \u201cI don't know how you feel about it, but\nI think this American Pie business is 'most too risky to put our money\ninto.\u201d\n\nPhineas had also been thinking, and his face offered no encouragement.\n\n\u201cEph,\u201d he said, \u201cyou're right there. If our farmers an' millers an'\nbakers did strike, an' folks starved to death, we'd like as not be\nimpeached an' tried for treason or something, an' put in jail fer life,\nif our necks wasn't broke by a rope. I like money, but not so much as\nto have that happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d said Eph; \u201can' I been thinkin' of another thing. Could\nwe get our old women to go into this thing? My wife ain't so far-sighted\nas I be; an' just at first, until we made a million or two, we'd have to\nsort o' depend on them to do the bakin'.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now that you put it right at me,\u201d said Phineas, \u201cI dunno as my\nwife would take right up with it, either. She seems bound to do just the\ncontrary to what I want her to do. But I dunno as I'd care to put money\ninto anything while these here labor unions keep actin' up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno as I would, either,\u201d said Eph. \u201cI guess mebby we'd better let\nthis thing lay over till the labor unions sort of play out. What say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon you're right,\u201d agreed Phineas. \u201cI guess we'd better mosey\nalong with these here pies, too.\u201d The two men arose from their shady\nseats, and Phineas swung his baskets upon his arms, but Eph seemed to be\nconsidering a delicate question.\n\n\u201cThat their pie I mashed,\u201d he said at length--\u201cI dunno what to say to my\nwife about it. She'll like to take my scalp off when she finds out I'm\nten cents shy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDog me, if I ain't glad it wasn't my pie,\u201d said Phin, heartily.\n\nEph coughed.\n\n\u201cYou don't reckon as mebby you could give me the loan of a dime till\nto-morrow, could you, Phin?\u201d he asked.\n\nPhineas grinned.\n\n\u201cWell, now, Eph,\u201d he said, \u201cI'd give it you in a minute if so be I had\nit; but I swan t' gracious, I ain't got a cent to my name.\u201d\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
