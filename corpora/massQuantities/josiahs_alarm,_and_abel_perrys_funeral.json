He said we would be too hot. He said,\n\u201cIn every other respect it wuz a perfect furnace, only it would be\nliable to heat us up too much.\u201d\n\nBy the contract Josiah wuz to give a big hefty price for the furnace,\nand this wuz the one they brung.\n\nWall, finally the agent talked so much about the awful amount of heat it\nwould throw out that Josiah got skairt, and he sez,\u2014\n\n\u201cI guess we had better get a smaller one, Samantha. How it would look to\nhave a sunstroke in the winter!\u201d sez he. \u201cIt would mortify me to have\none myself, or have you.\u201d\n\nThis wuz before they got it sot up. But I sez,\u2014\n\n\u201cBe calm, Josiah Allen. Don\u2019t let\u2019s be too hasty in our movements. I\ndare persume to say we may suffer from the heat ofttimes. But you know\nit is three or four sizes smaller than the one we laid out to have.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d sez Josiah. \u201cBut this is such a heater, Samantha, I s\u2019poze there\nhain\u2019t nothin\u2019 like it in the country for pourin\u2019 out the heat in\ntorrents. And it takes next to nothin\u2019 in coal to run it. I am sorry I\ngot so much coal,\u201d sez he, dreamily, a-lookin\u2019 at the big heaped-up ben.\n\u201cIt is all onnecessary; it hain\u2019t a-goin\u2019 to take more\u2019n a ton, if it\nduz that, to run it all winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shaw!\u201d sez I.\n\n\u201cWall, it won\u2019t take but a few pounds more, anyway. I know it won\u2019t from\nwhat the agent sez. I am sorry,\u201d sez he, \u201cthat I didn\u2019t get it by the\npound as we needed it. It hain\u2019t likely we shall ever empty that ben,\nnot if we don\u2019t live beyond the nateral age of mortals.\u201d\n\nAnd Josiah looked sad.\n\nBut I merely sez ag\u2019in, \u201cOh, shaw!\u201d For I didn\u2019t fall in with his idees\nat all. And the idee looked silly to me of his goin\u2019 to Jonesville and\nbringin\u2019 coal home a few pounds at a time, like tea, or suger; and so I\nsez \u201cOh, shaw!\u201d to it.\n\nAnd then he started off on a new tact, and sez he, \u201cI am afraid it is\nresky, anyway, to have it round. I am afraid it will burn up the house.\u201d\n\nBut I kep\u2019 on a-counselin\u2019 him to keep calm, and try it, and then he\nbegin on a new idee, about heatin\u2019 the door-yard with it from the\nfurnace-room door, and raisin\u2019 vegitables and flowers for market.\n\nBut I sez, \u201cWith snow eight or ten feet deep, and old zero a-goin\u2019 down\nto forty, I guess we can\u2019t raise many vegitables and flowers in the\ndoor-yard.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course we couldn\u2019t without the furnace,\u201d sez he. \u201cBut that furnace,\nfrom what that agent sez, would jest melt the snow right down and keep\nit warm as summer clear to the orchard fence. And the meltin\u2019 snow would\nmake the ground moist and rich. Why,\u201d sez he, \u201cSamantha, I believe we\ncould make our everlastin\u2019 fortune by it.\u201d\n\n\nAnd he sot down and crossed his legs, and begin to calculate, on the\nback of the Almanac, how much string-beans would fetch in January, and\nhow our lettuce would be sought for in December, and how much he ort to\nhave a head for it.\n\nBut I looked on this like one of the many bubbles I had seen him throw\nup rosy and gold tinted, to break anon over his devoted but bald head,\nand drizzle down into damp mist and nothin\u2019ness.\n\nAnd I kep\u2019 on a-tellin\u2019 him to be mejum, and to go slow. Sez I,\u2014\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you go to breakin\u2019 up ground and puttin\u2019 in garden-seeds in\nNovember on the strength of that furnace.\u201d\n\nBut sez he, \u201cThe heat of it ort to be utilized. It is not only resky to\nhave so much heat a-layin\u2019 loose round, but it seems wicked to waste\nit.\u201d\n\nAnd I ketched Josiah Allen that day a-figgerin\u2019 on a blank page in Fox\u2019s\nBook of Martyrs how he could carry the waste heat to the barn and heat\nup the cattle.\n\nBut I kep\u2019 calm through it all. Of course I knew from the agent\u2019s talk\nthat we wuz takin\u2019 a great resk onto us, almost like goin\u2019 to a torrid\nzone in the fall of the year. And though I did in my secret thoughts\napprehend sunstrokes and prostrations, and perused the medical portion\nof the Almanac in my hours of leisure, for directions to fetch folks to\nwhen they wuz prostrated by heat, still I kep\u2019 a calm demeanor on the\noutside of me, and never let on to Josiah that I had a apprehension.\n\nThat is my way, to keep still, and calm, and do everything I can to\navert danger.\n\n\nIn the same quiet way, I got out three old palm-leaf fans, and put new\nbindin\u2019s round the edges, and hemmed over the bottom of my old lawn\ndress, and I bought eleven yards of cheese bandage cloth at a outlay of\nfive cents a yard, and colored it a soft gray with plum boughs. If I\ncouldn\u2019t wear calico in the winter, as I mistrusted I couldn\u2019t from the\nagent\u2019s talk, why, I laid out to be prepared. And if my apprehensions\nwuz futile, why, I laid out to make it into a comforter for my bed. Ten\nyards would make the comforter, and the odd yard I needed for a\nwipin\u2019-cloth.\n\nThey wuz quite a long time a-settin\u2019 up the furnace. It seemed to me to\ntake a good while, but I wuzn\u2019t used to the common behavior of furnaces,\nand didn\u2019t know but it wuz one of their habits to be a good while\na-bein\u2019 sot up.\n\nOf course, Josiah bein\u2019 a man, and bein\u2019 round with the workmen more,\nand hearin\u2019 more of the skairful talk of that agent, about the heat that\nwuz soon a-goin\u2019 to pour onto us, it wuz nateral that he should get\nskairter than I wuz, and it wuz on the very afternoon that they finished\nsettin\u2019 it up, and I s\u2019poze the agent had acted very skairful, and also\nthe men that wuz a-helpin\u2019 set it up (for of course it wuz nateral that\nthey should all be linked together in their talk about it).\n\nIt wuz that very afternoon, along towards night, that I overheard\nJosiah, out by the gate, a-tryin\u2019 to sell his clothes, all his thick\nones. And I walked right out bareheaded, and interfered.\n\nBut Josiah sez, \u201cWhat will I ever want of \u2019em ag\u2019in?\u201d\n\nAnd I sez, \u201cYou act like a luny. Hain\u2019t you got to go out any more to\nmill or to meetin\u2019?\u201d\n\nBut sez he, \u201cI am only sellin\u2019 them that I wear round the house\nwinters.\u201d\n\nBut I sez, \u201cDo you desist imegiatly,\u201d sez I. \u201cIf the clothes hain\u2019t\nwanted, I need \u2019em for carpet-rags.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarpets!\u201d sez he. \u201cDo you s\u2019poze we can stand carpets in such a heat? I\nam goin\u2019 to buy mattin\u2019, mattin\u2019 of the very coolest kind.\u201d\n\nSez I, sternly, \u201cDo you stop sellin\u2019 or buyin\u2019, and wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d sez he, bitterly, \u201cwait! till we all have sunstrokes, and are\ndead and buried.\u201d\n\nI see he wuz fearfully worked up, and all the rest of the afternoon I\nmade errents for him to keep him away from that agent and the workmen. I\nsee he wuz gettin\u2019 completely onstrung. And I, with my own inward\napprehensions, wuz in no state to string him up ag\u2019in.\n\nSo I kep\u2019 him away from them by borrowin\u2019 things I didn\u2019t want of Mrs.\nGowdey, and sendin\u2019 home tea I never had to Miss Bobbitses, and etc.\netc.\n\nYes, to such depths of deceit will a woman\u2019s devoted love lead her.\n\nWall, about night they got it sot up, and Josiah and I proceeded\ndown-stairs to see it. They had all gone then, for Miss Bobbit had\ndetained Josiah with a long story. She mistrusted sunthin\u2019.\n\nWall, when we went down to see it, it looked queer enough. The furnace\nwuz so very small, and the big pipes a-leadin\u2019 from it in every\ndirection looked so very big.\n\nI don\u2019t know as I can describe it any better than to say it looked like\na small teacup sot out in a door-yard, with very big eave-spouts\na-runnin\u2019 from it all over the yard. Or as a very small infant of a few\nweeks of age would look, a-settin\u2019 up with a man\u2019s high hat on, and a\npair of number eleven boots.\n\nIt looked curious, and strange, so strange that I sithed, as I looked at\nit, and Josiah looked stunted, and he took out his bandanna handkerchief\nand wiped his forward, without words.\n\nFinally he sez, sort o\u2019 dreamily,\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2019Most all great inventions and discoveries look strange at first.\u201d\n\nAnd I sez, almost mechanically, \u201cYes, that is so, Josiah.\u201d\n\nAnd he spoke out ag\u2019in, \u201cNapoleon Boneparte wuz a small man, but what a\ngenerel he wuz! What a leader! How fiery he wuz!\u201d\n\nAnd I sez, \u201cYes,\u201d ag\u2019in.\n\nAnd he sez, a-brightenin\u2019 up in his thoughts, and in delicate defference\nto me,\u2014\n\n\u201cThe pen is mightier than the sword.\u201d\n\nWall, the next mornin\u2019 the fire wuz built in the furnace, and, it bein\u2019\nhot weather, it heat the house beautifully. It wuz about ninety in the\nshade, so the furnace heat the house warm, and the agent and men looked\ntriumphant, and ag\u2019in Josiah\u2019s apprehensions rose, and he wondered how\nhe wuz goin\u2019 to get through the winter with it without meltin\u2019 right\ndown in our tracts.\n\nBut I kep\u2019 cool, or as cool as I could in dog-days, and didn\u2019t say much.\n\nWall, it run along, and run along, the furnace always a-goin\u2019, to dry\nthe plasterin\u2019, and Josiah\u2019s stock of winter coal kep\u2019 a-dwindlin\u2019 down.\n\nWhatever else the furnace could do, or couldn\u2019t do, it could devour coal\nwith the best of \u2019em. Like some folks I have seen, it wuz small in size,\nbut had a immense appetite.\n\nTon after ton vanished like tales that wuz told, into its insatiable\nmouth (door of furnace).\n\nBut as the weather wuz still hot, it heat the house beautifully, so\nJosiah didn\u2019t complain. But he lay awake nights a-worryin\u2019 about the\neffects of heat.\n\nBut finally there come on a cold snap, jest as I wuz a-gettin\u2019 the new\nhouse cleaned, and carpets put down, and I found there wuzn\u2019t a room I\ncould set down in, it wuz so cold.\n\nIt wuz a very cold day when I had the dinin\u2019-room carpet put down, and I\nhad hired a stout healthy woman, two hundred pounds wuz her weight, and\nher temperature wuz above normal, it wuz so good.\n\nI went over to the house that mornin\u2019, and I shivered imperceptibly as I\nwalked through the rooms,\u2014I didn\u2019t venter to set,\u2014and I met Josiah\na-comin\u2019 up from the suller with his mittens on, and a comforter round\nhis neck, and his teeth a-chatterin\u2019.\n\nAnd I sez to him, \u201cHain\u2019t you glad you didn\u2019t sell your mittens and\ncomforter, Josiah?\u201d\n\nAnd he sez, real snappish, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nAnd I sez, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean no hurt, Josiah,\u201d and I added further, as I\nclapped my hands together to warm \u2019em, \u201cWe are both sufferers, Josiah\nAllen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d sez he, \u201cwhen we get into the house it will be different. Then\nwe can give it a fair test.\u201d\n\nAnd I sez, a-glancin\u2019 at the empty coal-ben,\u2014\n\n\n\u201cIf four tons of coal hain\u2019t a test, I don\u2019t know a test when I see it.\u201d\n\nWe had got down in front of the furnace by this time, and I looked down\non it pityin\u2019ly, it looked so fearful small, and the cold all round it\nseemed so intense.\n\nAnd I sez, \u201cThe poor little thing hain\u2019t to blame: it duz the best it\ncan, but it has took too hefty a job on it for its size and\nconstitution.\u201d\n\nHe wuz a-leanin\u2019 over the top of the furnace, a-brushin\u2019 off the icicles\nfrom his whiskers; and he sez, almost mechanically,\u2014\n\n\u201cYou know the man said it wuz such a heater; you know he said it wuz\nfairly dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d sez I, \u201cbut I learned long ago to put not your trust in princes,\nor agents,\u201d sez I. \u201cThat is Bible, Josiah, part on\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWall, he shivered so that I got him out of the furnace-room as quick as\nI could, and then I went up-stairs, a-wroppin\u2019 my thick woollen shawl\nmore closely round my frame, and I looked round to see what had become\nof my hired woman, for I feared the worst; I feared she had perished.\n\nBut no, I found she wuz resusitated. I found her a-settin\u2019 on the\nregester in the dinin\u2019-room floor, the heat turned on to its utmost\ncapacity, and she wuz a-sewin\u2019 on the carpet.\n\nBut she looked blue, and her frame shook. And she said she wuz cold,\nbitter cold.\n\nAnd she sez to me, in gloomy axents,\u2014\n\n\u201cHow are you a-goin\u2019 to stand it through the winter?\u201d\n\nMy soul wuz racked with the same agonizin\u2019 apprehensions. But I tried to\nbe calm; I wuz cool, I know,\u2014freezin\u2019 cool.\n\nWall, that afternoon I made a voyalent effort to have that furnace took\nout, and a bigger one put in, and one that had a warmer circulation and\na more healthy constitution inside of it.\n\n\u201cFor,\u201d sez I, \u201cif we enter this house with that furnace in it, we shall\nall likewise perish.\u201d\n\nI thought mebby if I used a skriptural term the man would hear to me,\nseein\u2019 he wuz a perfesser.\n\nBut no, he stood firm. He said \u201cwe hadn\u2019t tested it sufficient.\u201d And the\nrest of the men a-standin\u2019 round with blue noses, all jined in with him:\n\n\u201cNo, we hadn\u2019t tested it.\u201d\n\nWall, I gin my shawl a closter wrop round my chilly frame, and pinted my\nfrigid forefinger towards the empty coal-ben, and sez,\u2014\n\n\u201cIf four tons of coal hain\u2019t a test, what do you call one?\u201d\n\nAnd sez I, \u201cIf that hain\u2019t a test, there is a woman a-perishin\u2019 out\nthere now, a-settin\u2019 on the regester: bring her in for a test if you\nwant another.\u201d\n\nBut no; one of \u2019em recommended givin\u2019 her whiskey to keep her\ntemperature up till she got the carpet down.\n\nBut Josiah rousted up at that, and said \u201che wuzn\u2019t goin\u2019 to stand the\nexpense of keepin\u2019 folkses heat up with brandy.\u201d (That man is close.)\nAnd I repudiated the idee, and said, \u201cI put more faith in soapstuns and\nwoollen shawls.\u201d\n\nAnd I sez ag\u2019in, in eloquent axents, \u201cTake out that furnace, and put in\na bigger one, and I will move in and test it.\u201d\n\nAnd then they said \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnd we said \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnd then the man threw some hints at us about the law.\n\nAnd then Tirzah Ann throwed some back at him, about its not bein\u2019 a new\nfurnace.\n\nSuch news had come to us, and come very straight and direct. Miss Deacon\nElikum Peck told she that wuz Hetty Avery, and she that wuz Hetty told\nold Miss Blodgett, and she told the editor of the Augurses wife, and she\ntold Miss Preserved Green, and she told Tirzah Ann. It come straight.\n\nAnd then the man said that it hadn\u2019t never been sot up before, and also\nthat it had all been fixed over sense it wuz sot up.\n\nThis wuz very satisfactory to Josiah, but not to me, and I told him\nag\u2019in, impressively,\u2014\n\n\u201cTake out that furnace. My life I feel is at the stake.\u201d\n\nBut they stood firm. And when one party stands firm and won\u2019t move, the\nother party has got to; that is, if there is any movement.\n\nSo finally, with a forebodin\u2019 mind and a frosty frame, I took the\nventer.\n\nI had a large coal stove in the kitchen, so I knew that part of the\nhouse wuz habitable. So I moved in, accompanied by a good wood stove,\nwhich wuz sot up in my room.\n\nWall, the first thing that happened to me wuz a cold that set my teeth\nto achin\u2019 so hard it seemed as if they must shatter the gooms, and my\nface swelled up almost enormous. I lay in the most excrutiating agony\nfor a week. The pain I suffered every hour wuz costly enough to me to\nbuy the furnace, pipe and all, if pain could profit a man or woman.\n\nAt last I got easier through the constant application of hot poultices,\nmustard, catnip, etcetery. And a hot fire in my wood stove made me\ncomfortable in frame. I couldn\u2019t sleep, so I could \u2019tend to havin\u2019 the\nwood put in.\n\nOne night, the coldest of the season, worn out with long watchin\u2019 and\npain, I slept sound. So did the one who took care on me: we slept so\nsound that my wood fire languished and went out, and we wuz left in our\nweakness, in the silence and darkness, to the mercy of that poor little\nfurnace.\n\nCurious little thing, it wuzn\u2019t to blame: it did the best it could with\nits circulation and size.\n\nBut in the mornin\u2019 I waked up so cold that it seemed as if I would have\nloved to go to Greenland to have warmed up some, or Iceland would have\nbeen a grateful change.\n\nWaked up with a cold ketched there in my peaceful bed, that brung me\ndown to the very verge of the grave. Yes, I went down so close to the\ndark river that I could almost hear the mysterious swashin\u2019 of its waves\nagainst the shores of the Present.\n\nFor eight long weeks did I lay there and suffer, and doctors and nurses\na-sufferin\u2019 too; for it wuzn\u2019t only me they had to take care on, they\nhad to take constant and broodin\u2019 care of that poor feeble little\nfurnace: that had to be sot up with jest as regular as I did. Sometimes\nthey hired a man to set up with it regular till two in the mornin\u2019,\nthinkin\u2019 then it would survive till mornin\u2019. Sometimes they tried\nwaitin\u2019 on it three or four times a night, and keepin\u2019 it alive that\nway.\n\nWall, after eight or nine weeks of sufferin\u2019 almost onexampled, I got\nbetter; but the poor little furnace kep\u2019 on a-growin\u2019 weaker and more\nweak, its circulation more and more clogged up, and its inward fires\na-expirin\u2019 gradual.\n\nAnd finally consent wuz giv that we should put in a new furnace. And we\nimegiatly and to once bought a big noble-sized one, with a good healthy\ncirculation, that makes our house like summer all the time, day and\nnight.\n\nWhy, it fairly fools the house-plants, makes the silly things think it\n_is_ summer. And up stairs and down, in almost every livin\u2019-room their\nbig green leaves and dewy blossoms shine out, not mistrustin\u2019 that it\nhain\u2019t June.\n\nAnd the red and green parrot sets and talks and looks wise, and is\na-s\u2019pozin\u2019 all the time that he is in New Mexico.\n\nWall, the day that the little furnace wuz took out of the suller (poor\nlittle weak broken-down creeter, I can\u2019t help bein\u2019 sorry for it), that\nvery day I paid my doctor\u2019s bill,\u2014a good hefty one. The nurse\u2019s bill,\nand the bills of them that had sot up with me, and sot up with the\nfurnace, hadn\u2019t come in yet; but I knew they would be big, and ort to\nbe, a-takin\u2019 care on us both.\n\nThe doctor had just gone, and I wuz a-settin\u2019 in my room relapsted into\nmeditation and a big rockin\u2019-chair,\u2014for I wuz far from bein\u2019 strong\nyet,\u2014when all of a sudden my pardner burst into the room, all rousted up\nand agitated to a extreme degree, and sez he,\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat do you s\u2019poze we have discovered now, Samantha? How old do you\nthink that furnace is, Samantha Allen?\u201d\n\nAnd I sez, \u201cI don\u2019t feel like guessin\u2019 on deep subjects, feelin\u2019 as I\ndo, weak as a cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d sez he, \u201cthe body part of it is the very same old potash-kettle\nthat George Washington made potash in before the war of 1812.\u201d\n\nSez I, \u201cI don\u2019t believe any such thing,\u201d and sez I, a-leanin\u2019 back in my\ncopperplate chair,\u2014\n\n\u201cYou tire me, Josiah, with your wild and impassioned skemes and idees.\nOnly a little while ago you wuz a-tryin\u2019 to sell your clothes to escape\nthe burnin\u2019 qualities of that furnace, and now you are a-tryin\u2019 to make\nit out older\u2019n the hills.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is a fact,\u201d sez he. \u201cI re_cog_nized it the minute it wuz\noncovered. I see a picture of it once in a Life of Washington. It is a\npeculiar shape, and I can\u2019t be mistook.\u201d\n\nSez I, \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d sez he, firmly, \u201cI can prove it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d sez I.\n\n\u201cWall, there is a big hole in the side of it where his hired man got mad\nand kicked at it. It has been all cemented up and mended, but you can\nsee the marks plain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get holt of that idee?\u201d sez I, sternly.\n\n\u201cHistory,\u201d sez he. \u201cI read a good deal that I never told you about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should think as much,\u201d sez I. And I sez further,\u2014\n\n\u201cGet that idee out of your head to once, Josiah Allen. George Washington\nnever see this furnace: it wuz made sense his time.\u201d\n\n\nBut Josiah contended it wuz so, and left the room mad as a hen to think\nI wouldn\u2019t give in with him.\n\nAnd in less than ten minutes up he hurried with another idee in his\nhead. And sez he the first thing,\u2014\n\n\u201cMore proof, Samantha! in takin\u2019 the furnace apart we have found the old\nrim that Washington\u2019s folks used with his potash-kettle, all broke to\npieces and wired together.\u201d\n\nSez I, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe a word of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d sez he, triumphantly, \u201ccome down suller, and I will prove it.\u201d\n\nSo I tottered down suller (for what will not a wife do to please her\npardner?), and there, sure enough, wuz a iron rim which had been broke\nlong ago to all appearance, and mended with old wire. And the big part\ndid indeed look in shape like a old potash-kettle with some places in\nthe side that had been patched up with cement.\n\nI looked down on it pensively and sez,\u2014\n\n\u201cAnd that is what we wuz to pay that big hefty price for. That is what\nwuz a-goin\u2019 to give us sunstrokes in the winter, and prostrations from\ntoo fervid heat.\u201d\n\nA by-stander a-standin\u2019 by remarked tersely,\u2014\n\n\u201cAll it is good for is old iron.\u201d\n\nBut Josiah sez, \u201cWall, I\u2019ll bet George Washington made durned good\npotash in it. I\u2019ll bet it wuz a good kettle in its day.\u201d\n\nSez I, \u201cJosiah Allen, cease such talk. I should think we had suffered\nenough with the little thing, without lyin\u2019 about it.\u201d\n\nBut sez he, firmly, \u201cI believe every word I say, and I don\u2019t say a thing\nI can\u2019t prove. That is George Washington\u2019s potash-kettle.\u201d\n\nI sithed, and turned silently away, for I knew words wuz vain.\n\nAnd though I don\u2019t believe a word on it, and though I know it wuz made\nsense that time, and hain\u2019t nigh so old, I can\u2019t turn my companion\u2019s\nmind round the wedth of a horse-hair.\n\nHe will go down to the grave a-thinkin\u2019 that that wuz George\nWashington\u2019s potash-kettle, and them mended-up places he found in it wuz\nmade by the hired man a-kickin\u2019 at it when he was mad at George.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                        _Abel Perry\u2019s Funeral._\n\n                               ----------\n\n\nJOSIAH ALLEN and me had visitors, along the last of the winter,\u2014Abel\nPerry\u2019ses folks from \u2019way out beyond Loontown.\n\nThey come in good sperits and the mornin\u2019 train, and spent three days\nand three nights with us.\n\nYou see, they wuz relations of ourn, and had been for some time,\nentirely onbeknown to us, and they come a-huntin\u2019 us up. They said \u201cthey\nthought relations ort to be hunted up, and hang together.\u201d They said\n\u201cthe idee of huntin\u2019 us up had come to \u2019em after readin\u2019 my book.\u201d\n\nThey told me so, and I said, \u201cWall.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t add nor demenish to that one \u201cWall.\u201d For I didn\u2019t want to act\ntoo backward, nor too forward. I jest kep\u2019 kinder neutral, and said,\n\u201cWall.\u201d\n\nYou see, Abel\u2019s father\u2019s sister-in-law wuz step-mother to my aunt\u2019s\nsecond-cousin on her father\u2019s side. And Abel said that \u201che had felt more\nand more, as years went by, that it wuz a burnin\u2019 shame for relations to\nnot know and love each other.\u201d He said \u201che felt that he loved Josiah and\nme dearly.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t say right out whether it wuz reciprokated or not. I kinder\nsaid, \u201cWall,\u201d ag\u2019in.\n\nAnd I told Josiah, in perfect confidence and the wood-house chamber,\n\u201cthat I had seen nearer relations than Mr. Perry\u2019ses folks wuz to us.\u201d\n\nHowsumever, I done well by \u2019em. Josiah killed a fat turkey, and I baked\nit, and done other things for their comfort, and we had quite a good\ntime.\n\nAbel wuz ruther flowery and enthusiastick, and his mouth and voice wuz\nruther large, but he meant well, I should judge, and we had quite a good\ntime.\n\nShe wuz very freckled, and a second-day Baptist by perswasion, and was\npiecin\u2019 up a crazy bedquilt. She went a-visitin\u2019 a good deal, and got\npieces of the wimmen\u2019s dresses where she visited for blocks. So it wuz\nquite a savin\u2019 bedquilt, and very good-lookin\u2019, considerin\u2019.\n\n\nBut to resoom and continue on. Abel\u2019s folks made us promise on our two\nsacred honors, Josiah\u2019s honor and mine, that we would pay back the\nvisit, for, as Abel said, \u201cfor relatives to live so clost to each other,\nand not visit back and forth, wuz a burnin\u2019 shame and a disgrace.\u201d And\nJosiah promised that we would go right away after sugarin\u2019.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t promise on the New Testament, as Abel wanted us to (he is\ndretful enthusiastick); but we gin good plain promises that we would go,\nand laid out to keep our two words.\n\nSo along a week or so after sugarin\u2019, Josiah beset me one day to go over\nto Mr. Perry\u2019ses.\n\nJosiah liked Abel; there wuz sunthin\u2019 in his intense enthusiastick\nnature and extravagant methods that wuz congenial to Josiah.\n\nSo I bein\u2019 agreeable to the idee, we set out after dinner, a-layin\u2019 out\nto be gone two nights and one hull day, and two parts of days, a-goin\u2019\nand a-comin\u2019 back.\n\nWall, we got there onexpected, as they had come onto us. And we found\n\u2019em plunged into trouble.\n\nTheir only child, a girl, who had married a young lawyer of Loontown,\nhad jest lost her husband with the typus, and they wuz a-makin\u2019\npreparations for the funeral when we got there. She and her husband had\ncome home on a visit, and he wuz took down bed-sick there and died.\n\nI told \u2019em I felt like death to think I had descended down onto \u2019em at\nsuch a time.\n\nBut Abel said he wuz jest despatchin\u2019 a messenger for us when we arrove,\nfor, he said, \u201cin a time of trouble, then wuz the time, if ever, that a\nman wanted his near relations clost to him.\u201d\n\nAnd he said \u201cwe had took a load offen him by appearin\u2019 jest as we did,\nfor there would have been some delay in gettin\u2019 us there, if the\nmessenger had been despatched.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cthat mornin\u2019 he had felt so bad that he wanted to die,\u2014it\nseemed as if there wuzn\u2019t nothin\u2019 left for him to live for; but now he\nfelt that he had sunthin\u2019 to live for, now his relatives wuz gethered\nround him.\u201d\n\nJosiah shed tears to hear Abel go on. I myself didn\u2019t weep none, but I\nwuz glad if we could be any comfort to \u2019em, and told \u2019em so.\n\nAnd I told Sally Ann, that wuz Abel\u2019ses wife, that I would do anything\nthat I could to help \u2019em.\n\nAnd she said \u201ceverything wuz a-bein\u2019 done that wuz necessary. She didn\u2019t\nknow of but one thing that wuz likely to be overlooked and neglected,\nand that wuz the crazy bedquilt.\u201d She said \u201cshe would love to have that\nfinished, to throw over a lounge in the settin\u2019-room, that wuz frayed\nout on the edges. And if I felt like it, it _would_ be a great relief to\nher to have me take it right offen her hands, and finish it.\u201d\n\nSo I took out my thimble and needle (I always carry such necessaries\nwith me, in a huzzy made expressly for that purpose), and I sot down and\nwent to piecin\u2019 up. There wuz seventeen blocks to piece up, each one\ncrazy as a loon to look at, and it wuz all to set together.\n\nShe had the pieces, for she had been off on a visitin\u2019 tower the week\nbefore, and collected of \u2019em.\n\nSo I sot in quiet and the big cheer in the settin\u2019-room, and pieced up,\nand see the preparations a-goin\u2019 on round us.\n\nI found that Abel\u2019ses folks lived in a house big and showy-lookin\u2019, but\nnot so solid and firm as I had seen.\n\nIt wuz one of the houses, outside and inside, where more pains had been\ntook with the porticos and ornaments than with the underpinnin\u2019.\n\nIt had a showy and kind of a shaky look. And I found that that extended\nto Abel\u2019ses business arraingments. Amongst the other ornaments of his\nbuildin\u2019s wuz mortgages, quite a lot of \u2019em, and of almost every\nvariety. He had gin his only child S. Annie (she wuz named after her\nmother Sally Ann, but wrote it this way),\u2014he had gin S. Annie a showy\neducation, a showy weddin\u2019, and a showy settin\u2019-out. But she had had the\ngood luck to marry a sensible man, though poor.\n\nHe took S. Annie, and the brackets, and piano, and hangin\u2019 lamps, and\nbaskets, and crystal bead lambrequins, her father had gin her, moved \u2019em\nall into a good sensible small house, and went to work to get a practice\nand a livin\u2019. He wuz a lawyer by perswasion.\n\nWall, he worked hard, day and night, for three little children come to\n\u2019em pretty fast, and S. Annie consumed a good deal in trimmin\u2019s and\ncheap lace to ornament \u2019em: she wuz her father\u2019s own girl for ornament.\nBut he worked so hard, and had so many irons in the fire, and kep \u2019em\nall so hot, that he got a good livin\u2019 for \u2019em, and begun to lay up money\ntowards byin\u2019 \u2019em a house, a home.\n\n\nHe talked a sight, so folks said that knew him well, about his consumin\u2019\ndesire and aim to get his wife and children into a little home of their\nown, into a safe little haven, where they could be a little sheltered\nfrom the storms of life if the big waves should wash him away. They say\nthat that wuz on his mind day and night, and wuz what nerved his hand so\nin the fray, and made him so successful.\n\nWall, he had laid up about nine hundred dollars towards a home, every\ndollar on it earned by hard work and consecrated by this deathless hope\nand affection. The house he had got his mind on only cost about a\nthousand dollars. Loontown property is cheap.\n\nWall, he had laid up nine hundred, and wuz a-beginnin\u2019 to save on the\nlast hundred, for he wouldn\u2019t run in debt a cent anyway, when he wuz\ntook voyalent sick there to Abel\u2019ses: he and S. Annie had come home for\na visit of a day or two; and he bein\u2019 so run down, and weak with his\nhard day work, and his night work, that he suckumbed to his sickness,\nand passed away the day before I got there.\n\nWall, S. Annie wuz jest overcome with grief the day I got there, but the\nday follerin\u2019 she begun to take some interest, and help her father in\nmakin\u2019 preparations for the funeral.\n\nThe body wuz embalmed, accordin\u2019 to Abel\u2019ses and S. Annie\u2019s wish, and\nthe funeral wuz to be on the Sunday follerin\u2019, and on that Abel and S.\nAnnie now bent their energies.\n\nTo begin with, S. Annie had a hull suit of clear crape made for herself,\nwith a veil that touched the ground; she also had three other suits\ncommenced, for more common wear, trimmed heavy with crape, one of which\nshe ordered for sure the next week, for she said \u201cshe couldn\u2019t stir out\nof the house in any other color but black.\u201d\n\nI knew jest how dear crape wuz, and I tackled her on the subject, and\nsays I,\u2014\n\n\u201cDo you know, S. Annie, those dresses of yourn will cost a sight?\u201d\n\n\u201cCost?\u201d says she, a-bustin\u2019 out a-cryin\u2019. \u201cWhat do I care about cost? I\nwill do everything I can to respect his memory. I do it in remembrance\nof him.\u201d\n\nSays I, gently, \u201cS. Annie, you wouldn\u2019t forget him if you wuz dressed in\nwhite. And as for respect, such a life as his, from all I hear of it,\ndon\u2019t need crape to throw respect on it: it commands respect, and gets\nit from everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d says Abel, \u201cit would look dretful odd to the neighbors if she\ndidn\u2019t dress in black.\u201d Says he, in a skairful tone, and in his intense\nway,\u2014\n\n\u201cI would ruther resk my life than to have her fail in duty in this way:\nit would make talk!\u201d And says he, \u201cWhat is life worth when folks talk?\u201d\n\nI turned around the crazed block, and tackled it in a new place (more\nluny than ever it seemed to me), and says I, mekanickly,\u2014\n\n\u201cIt is pretty hard work to keep folks from talkin\u2019, to keep \u2019em from\nsayin\u2019 sunthin\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut I see from their looks it wouldn\u2019t do to say anything more, so I had\nto set still and see it go on.\n\nAt that time of year flowers wuz dretful high, but S. Annie and Abel had\nmade up their minds that they must have several flower-pieces from the\ncity nighest to Loontown.\n\nOne wuz goin\u2019 to be a gate ajar, and one wuz to be a gate wide open. And\none wuz to be a big book. Abel asked me what book I thought would be\nprefferable to represent. And I mentioned the Bible.\n\nBut Abel says, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t think he would have a Bible; he didn\u2019t\nthink it would be appropriate, seein\u2019 the deceased wuz a lawyer.\u201d He\nsaid \u201che hadn\u2019t quite made up his mind what book to have. But anyway it\nwuz to be in flowers,\u2014beautiful flowers.\u201d Another piece wuz to be his\nname in white flowers on a purple background of pansies. His name wuz\nWilliam Henry Harrison Rockyfeller. And I says to Abel,\u2014\n\n\u201cTo save expense, you will probable have the moneygram W. H. H. R.?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d says he.\n\nSays I, \u201cThen the initials of his given names, and the last name in\nfull.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d he said; \u201cit wuz S. Annie\u2019s wish, and hisen, that the hull\nname should be put on. They thought it would show more respect.\u201d\n\nI says, \u201cWhere Harrison is now, that hain\u2019t a-goin\u2019 to make any\ndifference;\u201d and, says I, \u201cAbel, flowers are dretful high this time of\nyear, and it is a long name.\u201d\n\nBut Abel said ag\u2019in that he didn\u2019t care for expense, so long as respect\nwuz done to the memory of the deceased. He said that he and S. Annie\nboth felt that it wuz their wish to have the funeral go ahead of any\nother that had ever took place in Loontown or Jonesville. He said that\nS. Annie felt that it wuz all that wuz left her now in life, the memory\nof such a funeral as he deserved.\n\nSays I, \u201cThere is his children left for her to live for,\u201d says I,\u2014\u201cthree\nlittle bits of his own life, for her to nourish, and cherish, and look\nout for.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Abel. \u201cAnd she will do that nobly, and I will help her. They\nare all goin\u2019 to the funeral, too, in deep-black dresses.\u201d He said \u201cthey\nwuz too little to realize it now, but in later and maturer years it\nwould be a comfort to \u2019em to know they had took part in such a funeral\nas that wuz goin\u2019 to be, and wuz dressed in black.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d says I (in a quite onassumin\u2019 way I would gin little hints of my\nmind on the subject), \u201cI am afraid that will be about all the comforts\nof life the poor little children will ever have,\u201d says I. \u201cIt will if\nyou buy many more flower-pieces and crape dresses.\u201d\n\nAbel said \u201cit wouldn\u2019t take much crape for the children\u2019s dresses, they\nwuz so little, only the baby\u2019s: that would have to be long.\u201d\n\nSays I, \u201cThe baby would look better in white, and it will take sights of\ncrape for a long baby dress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but S. Annie can use it afterwards for veils. She is very\neconomical; she takes it from me. And she feels jest as I do, that the\nbaby must wear it in respect to her father\u2019s memory.\u201d\n\nSays I, \u201cThe baby don\u2019t know crape from a clothes-pin.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Abel, \u201cbut in after-years the thought of the respect she\nshowed will sustain her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d says I, \u201cI guess she won\u2019t have much besides thoughts to live\non, if things go on in this way.\u201d\n\nI would give little hints in this way, but they wuzn\u2019t took. Things went\nright on as if I hadn\u2019t spoke. And I couldn\u2019t contend, for truly, as a\nbad little boy said once on a similar occasion, \u201cit wuzn\u2019t my funeral,\u201d\nso I had to set and work on that insane bedquilt and see it go on. But I\nsithed constant and frequent, and when I wuz all alone in the room I\nindulged in a few low groans.\n\nTwo dress-makers wuz in the house, to stay all the time till the dresses\nwuz done; and clerks would come around, if not oftener, with packages of\nmournin\u2019 goods and mournin\u2019 jewelry, and mournin\u2019 handkerchiefs, and\nmournin\u2019 stockin\u2019s, and mournin\u2019 stockin\u2019-supporters, and mournin\u2019\nsafety-pins, and etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.\n\nEvery one of \u2019em, I knew, a-wrenchin\u2019 boards offen the sides of that\nhouse that Harrison had worked so hard to get for his wife and little\nones.\n\nWall, the day of the funeral come. It wuz a wet, drizzly day, but Abel\nwuz up early, to see that everything wuz as he wanted it to be.\n\nAs far as I wuz concerned, I had done my duty, for the crazy bedquilt\nwuz done; and though brains might totter as they looked at it, I felt\nthat it wuzn\u2019t my fault. Sally Ann spread it out with complacency over\nthe lounge, and thanked me, with tears in her eyes, for my noble deed.\n\nAlong quite early in the mornin\u2019, before the show commenced, I went in\nto see Harrison.\n\nHe lay there calm and peaceful, with a look on his face as if he had got\naway, at last from a atmosphere of show and sham, and had got into the\ngreat Reality of life.\n\n\nIt wuz a good face, and the worryment and care that folks told me had\nbeen on it for years had all faded away. But the look of determination,\nand resolve, and bravery,\u2014that wuz ploughed too deep in his face to be\nsmoothed out, even by the mighty hand that had lain on it. The resolved\nlook, the brave look with which he had met the warfare of life, toiled\nfor victory over want, toiled to place his dear and helpless ones in a\nposition of safety,\u2014that look wuz on his face yet, as if the deathless\nhope and endeavor had gone on into eternity with him.\n\nAnd by the side of him, on a table, wuz the big high flower-pieces,\nbeginnin\u2019 already to wilt and decay.\n\nWall, it\u2019s bein\u2019 such a oncommon bad day, there wuzn\u2019t many to the\nfuneral. But we rode to the meetin\u2019-house in Loontown in a state and\nsplendor that I never expect to ag\u2019in. Abel had hired eleven\nmournin\u2019-coaches, and the day bein\u2019 so bad, and so few a-turnin\u2019 out to\nthe funeral, that in order to occupy all the coaches, and Abel thought\nit would look better and more popular to have \u2019em all occupied, we\ndivided up, and Josiah went in one, alone, and lonesome as a dog, as he\nsaid, afterwards to me. And I sot up straight and uncomfortable in\nanother one of \u2019em, stark alone.\n\nAbel had one to himself, and his wife another one, and two old maids,\nsisters of Abel\u2019ses who always made a point of attendin\u2019 funerals, they\neach one of \u2019em had one. S. Annie and her children of course had the\nfirst one, and then the minister had one, and one of the trustees in the\nneighborhood had another: so we lengthened out into quite a crowd, all\na-follerin\u2019 the shiny hearse, and the casket all covered with showy\nplated nails. I thought of it in jest that way, for Harrison, I knew,\nthe real Harrison, wuzn\u2019t there. No, he wuz far away,\u2014as far as the Real\nis from the Unreal.\n\nWall, we filed into the Loontown meetin\u2019-house in pretty good shape,\nthough Abel hadn\u2019t no black handkerchief, and he looked worried about\nit. He had shed tears a-tellin\u2019 me about it, what a oversight it wuz,\nwhile I wuz a-fixin\u2019 on his mournin\u2019 weed. He took it into his head to\nhave a deeper weed at the last minute, so I fixed it on. He had the weed\ncome up to the top of his hat and lap over. I never see so tall a weed.\nBut it suited Abel; he said \u201che thought it showed deep respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d says I, \u201cit is a deep weed, anyway,\u2014the deepest I ever see.\u201d And\nhe said, as I wuz a-sewin\u2019 it on, he a-holdin\u2019 his hat for me, \u201cthat\nHarrison deserved it; he deserved it all.\u201d\n\nBut, as I say, he shed tears to think that his handkerchief wuzn\u2019t\nblack-bordered. He said \u201cit wuz a fearful oversight; it would probably\nmake talk.\u201d\n\nBut I says, \u201cMebby it won\u2019t be noticed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it will,\u201d says he. \u201cIt will be noticed.\u201d And says he, \u201cI don\u2019t\ncare about myself, but I am afraid it will reflect onto Harrison. I am\nafraid they will think it shows a lack of respect for him. For\nHarrison\u2019s sake I feel cut down about it.\u201d\n\nAnd I says, \u201cI guess where Harrison is now, the color of a\nhandkerchief-border hain\u2019t a-goin\u2019 to make much difference to him either\nway.\u201d\n\nAnd I don\u2019t s\u2019pose it wuz noticed much, for there wuzn\u2019t more\u2019n ten or a\ndozen folks there when we went in. We went in in Injin file mostly, by\nAbel\u2019ses request, so\u2019s to make more show. And as a procession we wuz\nmiddlin\u2019 long, but ruther thin.\n\nThe sermon was not so very good as to quality, but abundant as to\nquantity. It wuz, as nigh as I could calkerlate, about a hour and\nthree-quarters long. Josiah whispered to me along about the last that\n\u201cwe had been there over seven hours, and his legs wuz paralyzed.\u201d\n\nAnd I whispered back that \u201cseven hours would take us into the night, and\nto stretch his feet out and pinch \u2019em;\u201d which he did.\n\nBut it wuz long and tejus. My feet got to sleep twice, and I had hard\nwork to wake \u2019em up ag\u2019in. The sermon meant to be about Harrison, I\ns\u2019pose; he did talk a sight about him, and then he kinder branched off\nonto politics, and then the Inter-State bill; he kinder favored it, I\nthought.\n\nWall, we all got drippin\u2019 wet a-goin\u2019 home, for Abel insisted on our\ngettin\u2019 out at the grave, for he had hired some oncommon high singers\n(high every way, in price and in notes) to sing at the grave.\n\nAnd so we disembarked in the drippin\u2019 rain, on the wet grass, and formed\na procession ag\u2019in. And Abel had a long exercise right there in the\nrain. But the singin\u2019 wuz kinder jerky, and cur\u2019us, and they had got\ntheir pay beforehand, so they hurried it through. And one man, the\ntenor, who wuz dretful afraid of takin\u2019 cold, hurried through his part,\nand got through first, and started on a run for the carriage. The others\nstood their grounds till the piece wuz finished, but they put in some\ndretful cur\u2019us quavers. I believe they had had chills: it sounded like\nit.\n\n\nTake it altogether, I don\u2019t believe anybody got much satisfaction out of\nit, only Abel. S. Annie sp\u2019ilt her dress and bonnet entirely\u2014they wuz\nwilted all down; and she ordered another suit jest like it before she\nslept.\n\nWall, the next mornin\u2019 early two men come with plans for monuments. Abel\nhad telegrafted to \u2019em to come with plans and bid for the job of\nfurnishin\u2019 the monument.\n\nAnd after a good deal of talk on both sides, Abel and S. Annie selected\none that wuz very high and p\u2019inted.\n\nThe men stayed to dinner, and I said to Abel, out to one side,\u2014\n\n\u201cAbel, that monument is a-goin\u2019 to cost a sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d says he, \u201cwe can\u2019t raise too high a one. Harrison deserved it\nall.\u201d\n\nSays I, \u201cWon\u2019t that, and all these funeral expenses, take about all the\nmoney he left?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d says he. \u201cHe had insured his life for a large amount, and it\nall goes to his wife and children. He deserves a monument, if a man ever\ndid.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d says I, \u201cdon\u2019t you believe that Harrison would rather have S.\nAnnie and the children settled down in a good little home, with sunthin\u2019\nleft to take care of \u2019em, than to have all this money spent in perfectly\nuseless things?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Useless!_\u201d says Abel, turnin\u2019 red. \u201cWhy,\u201d says he, \u201cif you wuzn\u2019t a\nnear relation I should resent that speech bitterly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d says I, \u201cwhat do all these flowers, and empty carriages, and\nsilver-plated nails, and crape, and so forth,\u2014what does it all amount\nto?\u201d\n\n\u201cRespect and honor to his memory,\u201d says Abel, proudly.\n\nSays I, \u201cSuch a life as Harrison\u2019s had them; nobody could take \u2019em away,\nnor demenish \u2019em. Such a brave, honest life is crowned with honor and\nrespect anyway. It don\u2019t need no crape, nor flowers, nor monuments, to\nwin \u2019em. And at the same time,\u201d says I, dreamily, \u201cif a man is mean, no\namount of crape, or flower-pieces, or flowery sermons, or obituries, is\na-goin\u2019 to cover up that meanness. A life has to be lived out-doors, as\nit were: it can\u2019t be hid. A string of mournin\u2019 carriages, no matter how\nlong, hain\u2019t a-goin\u2019 to carry a dishonorable life into honor, and no\ngrave, no matter how low and humble it is, is a-goin\u2019 to cover up a\nhonorable life.\n\n\u201cSuch a life as Harrison\u2019s don\u2019t need no monument to carry up the story\nof his virtues into the heavens: it is known there already. And them\nthat mourn his loss don\u2019t need cold marble words to recall his goodness\nand faithfulness. The heart where the shadow of his eternal absence has\nfell, don\u2019t need crape to make it darker.\n\n\u201cHarrison wouldn\u2019t be forgot if S. Annie wore pure white from day to\nday. No, nobody that knew Harrison, from all I have hearn of him, needs\ncrape to remind \u2019em that he wuz once here and now is gone.\n\n\u201cHowsomever, as far as that is concerned, I always feel that mourners\nmust do as they are a mind to about crape, with fear and tremblin\u2019,\u2014that\nis, if they are well off, and _can_ do as they are a mind to; and the\nsame with monuments, flowers, empty coaches, etc. But in this case, Abel\nPerry, I wouldn\u2019t be a-doin\u2019 my duty if I didn\u2019t speak my mind. When I\nlook at these little helpless souls that are left in a cold world with\nnothin\u2019 to stand between them and want but the small means their pa\nworked so hard for and left for the express purpose of takin\u2019 care of\n\u2019em, it seems to me a foolish thing, and a cruel thing, to spend all\nthat money on what is entirely onnecessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnnecessary!\u201d says Abel, angrily. \u201cAg\u2019in I say, Josiah Allen\u2019s wife,\nthat if it wuzn\u2019t for our close relationship I should turn on you. A\nworm will turn,\u201d says he, \u201cif it is too hardly trampled on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hain\u2019t trampled on you,\u201d says I, \u201cnor hain\u2019t had no idea on\u2019t. I wuz\nonly statin\u2019 the solemn facts and truth of the matter. And you will see\nit some time, Abel Perry, if you don\u2019t now.\u201d\n\nSays Abel, \u201cThe worm has turned, Josiah Allen\u2019s wife! Yes, I feel that I\nhave got to look now to more distant relations for comfort. Yes, the\nworm has been stepped on too heavy.\u201d\n\nHe looked cold, cold as a iceickle, almost. And I see that jest the few\nwords I had spoke, jest the slight hints I had gin, hadn\u2019t been took as\nthey should have been took. So I said no more. For ag\u2019in the remark of\nthat little bad boy came up in my mind, and restrained me from sayin\u2019\nany more.\n\nTruly, as the young male child observed, \u201cit wuzn\u2019t my funeral.\u201d\n\nWe went home almost immejiately afterwards, my heart nearly a-bleedin\u2019\nfor the little children, poor little creeters, and Abel actin\u2019 cold and\ndistant to the last.\n\nAnd we hain\u2019t seen \u2019em sense. But news has come from them, and come\nstraight. Josiah heerd to Jonesville, all about it.\n\nThe miller at Loontown wuz down to the Jonesville mill to get the loan\nof some bags, and Josiah happened to be there to mill that day, and\nheerd all about it.\n\nAbel had got the monument. And the ornaments on it cost far more than he\nexpected. There wuz a wreath a-runnin\u2019 round it clear from the bottom to\nthe top, and verses a kinder runnin\u2019 up it at the same time. And it cost\nfearful. Poetry a-runnin\u2019 up, they say, costs far more than it duz on a\nlevel.\n\nAnyway, the two thousand dollars that wuz insured on Harrison\u2019s life\nwuzn\u2019t quite enough to pay for it. But the sale of his law library and\nthe best of the housen stuff paid it. The nine hundred he left went,\nevery mite of it, to pay the funeral expenses, and mournin\u2019 for the\nfamily.\n\nAnd, as bad luck always follers on in a procession, them mortgages of\nAbel\u2019ses all run out sort o\u2019 together. His creditors sold him out, and\nwhen his property was all disposed of it left him over fourteen hundred\ndollars in debt.\n\nThe creditors acted perfectly greedy, so they say,\u2014took everything they\ncould; and one of the meanest ones took that insane bedquilt that I\nfinished. That _wuz_ mean. They say Sally Ann crumpled right down when\nthat wuz took. Some say that they got holt of that tall weed of\nAbel\u2019ses, and some dispute it; some say that he wore it on the last ride\nhe took in Loontown.\n\nBut, howsomever, Abel wuz took sick, Sally Ann wuzn\u2019t able to do\nanything for their support, S. Annie wuz took down with the typus, and\nso it happened the very day the monument wuz brought to the Loontown\nCemetery, Abel Perry\u2019ses folks was carried to the county house for the\nwinter, S. Annie, the children, and all.\n\n\nAnd it happened dretful cur\u2019us, but the town hired that very team that\ndrawed the monument there, to take the family back.\n\nIt wuz a good team.\n\nThe monument wuzn\u2019t set up, for they lacked money to pay for the\nunderpinnin\u2019. (Wuzn\u2019t it cur\u2019us, Abel Perry never would think of the\nunderpinnin\u2019 to anything?) But it lay there by the side of the road, a\ngreat white shape.\n\nAnd they say the children wuz skairt, and cried, when they went by\nit,\u2014cried and wept.\n\nBut I believe it wuz because they wuz cold and hungry that made \u2019em cry.\nI don\u2019t believe it wuz the monument.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n \u25cf Transcriber\u2019s Notes:\n    \u25cb Missing or obscured punctuation was silently corrected.\n    \u25cb Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation were made consistent only\n      when a predominant form was found in this book.\n    \u25cb Text that was in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
