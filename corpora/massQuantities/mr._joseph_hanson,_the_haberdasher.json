    "body": "These are good days for great heroes; so far at least as regards the\ngeneral spread and universal diffusion of celebrity. In the matter\nof fame, indeed, that grand bill upon posterity which is to be found\nwritten in the page of history, and the changes of empires, Alexander\nmay, for aught I know, be nearly on a par with the Duke of Wellington;\nbut in point of local and temporary tributes to reputation, the great\nancient, king though he were, must have been far behind the great\nmodern. Even that comparatively recent warrior, the Duke of Marlborough,\nmade but a slight approach to the popular honours paid to the conqueror\nof Napoleon. A few alehouse signs and the ballad of \"Marlbrook s'en va't\nen guerre,\" (for we are not talking now of the titles, and pensions, and\npalaces, granted to him by the Sovereign and the Parliament,) seem to\nhave been the chief if not the only popular demonstrations vouchsafed by\nfriends and enemies to the hero of Blenheim.\n\nThe name of Wellington, on the other hand, is necessarily in every man's\nmouth at every hour of every day. He is the universal godfather of every\nnovelty, whether in art, in literature, or in science. Streets, bridges,\nplaces, crescents, terraces, and railways, on the land; steam-boats on\nthe water; balloons in the air, are all distinguished by that honoured\nappellation. We live in Wellington squares, we travel in Wellington\ncoaches, we dine in Wellington hotels, we are educated in Wellington\nestablishments, and are clothed from top to toe (that is to say the male\nhalf of the nation) in Wellington boots, Wellington cloaks, Wellington\nhats, each of which shall have been severally purchased at a warehouse\nbearing the same distinguished title.\n\nSince every market town and almost every village in the kingdom, could\nboast a Wellington house, or a Waterloo house, emulous to catch some\ngilded ray from the blaze of their great namesake's glory, it would have\nbeen strange indeed if the linendrapers and haberdashers of our good\ntown of Belford Regis had been so much in the rear of fashion as to\nneglect this easy method of puffing off their wares. On the contrary,\nso much did our shopkeepers rely upon the influence of an illustrious\nappellation, that they seemed to despair of success unless sheltered by\nthe laurels of the great commander, and would press his name into the\nservice, even after its accustomed and legitimate forms of use seemed\nexhausted. Accordingly we had not only a Wellington house and a Waterloo\nhouse, but a new Waterloo establishment, and a genuine and original Duke\nof Wellington warehouse.\n\nThe new Waterloo establishment, a flashy dashy shop in the market-place,\noccupying a considerable extent of frontage, and \"conducted (as the\nadvertisements have it) by Mr. Joseph Hanson, late of London,\" put forth\nby far the boldest pretensions of any magazine of finery and frippery in\nthe town; and it is with that magnificent _store_, and with that only,\nthat I intend to deal in the present story.\n\nIf the celebrated Mr. Puff, he of the Critic, who, although Sheridan\nprobably borrowed the idea of that most amusing personage from the\nauctioneers and picture-dealers of Foote's admirable farces,\nfirst reduced to system the art of profitable lying, setting forth\nmethodically (scientifically it would be called in these days) the\ndifferent genera and species of that flourishing craft--if Mr. Puff\nhimself were to revisit this mortal stage, he would lift up his hands\nand eyes in admiration and astonishment at the improvements which have\ntaken place in the art from whence he took, or to which he gave, a name\n(for the fact is doubtful) the renowned art of Puffing!\n\nTalk of the progress of society, indeed! of the march of intellect, and\nthe diffusion of knowledge, of infant schools and adult colleges,\nof gas-lights and rail-roads, of steam-boats and steam-coaches, of\nliterature for nothing, and science for less! What are they and fifty\nother such nick-nacks compared with the vast strides made by this\nimproving age in the grand art of puffing? Nay, are they not for the\nmost part mere implements and accessories of that mighty engine of\ntrade? What is half the march of intellect, but puffery? Why do little\nchildren learn their letters at school, but that they may come hereafter\nto read puffs at college? Why but for the propagation of puffs do\nhonorary lecturers hold forth upon science, and gratuitous editors\ncirculate literature? Are not gas-lights chiefly used for their\nillumination, and steamboats for their spread? And shall not history,\nwhich has given to one era the name of the age of gold, and has entitled\nanother the age of silver, call this present nineteenth century the age\nof puffs?\n\nTake up the first thing upon your table, the newspaper for instance, or\nthe magazine, the decorated drawing-box, the Bramah pen, and twenty to\none but a puff more or less direct shall lurk in the patent of the one,\nwhile a whole congeries of puffs shall swarm in bare and undisguised\neffrontery between the pages of the other.\n\nWalk into the streets;--and what meet you there? Puffs! puffs! puffs!\nFrom the dead walls, chalked over with recommendations to purchase\nMr. Such-an-one's blacking, to the walking placard insinuating the\nexcellences of Mr. What-d'ye-call-him's Cream Gin*--from the bright\nresplendent brass-knob, garnished with the significant words \"Office\nBell,\" beside the door of an obscure surveyor, to the spruce carriage\nof a newly arrived physician driving empty up and down the street,\neverything whether movable or stationary is a puff.\n\n     * He was a genius in his line (I had almost written an evil\n     genius) who invented that rare epithet, that singular\n     combination of the sweetest and purest of all luxuries, the\n     most healthful and innocent of dainties, redolent of\n     association so rural and poetical, with the vilest\n     abominations of great cities, the impure and disgusting\n     source of misery and crime. Cream Gin! The union of such\n     words is really a desecration of one of nature's most genial\n     gifts, as well as a burlesque on the charming old pastoral\n     poets; a flagrant offence against morals, and against that\n     which in its highest sense may almost be considered a branch\n     of morality--taste.\n\nBut shops form, of course, the chief locality of the craft of puffing.\nThe getting off of goods is its grand aim and object. And of all shops\nthose which are devoted to the thousand and one articles of female\ndecoration, the few things which women do, and the many which they do\nnot want, stand pre-eminent in this great art of the nineteenth century.\n\nNot to enter upon the grand manoeuvres of the London establishments, the\ndoors for carriages to set down and the doors for carriages to take\nup, indicating an affluence of customers, a degree of crowd and\ninconvenience equal to the King's Theatre, on a Saturday night, or the\nqueen's drawing-room on a birthday, and attracting the whole female\nworld by that which in a fashionable cause the whole female world loves\nso dearly, confusion, pressure, heat and noise;--to say nothing of those\nbold schemes which require the multitudes of the metropolis to afford\nthem the slightest chance of success, we in our good borough of Belford\nRegis, simple as it stands, had, as I have said, as pretty a show of\nspeculating haberdashers as any country town of its inches could well\ndesire; the most eminent of whom was beyond all question or competition,\nthe proprietor of the New Waterloo Establishment, Mr. Joseph Hanson,\nlate of London.\n\nHis shop displayed, as I have already intimated, one of the largest and\nshowiest frontages in the market-place, and had been distinguished by a\ngreater number of occupants and a more rapid succession of failures in\nthe same line than any other in the town.\n\nThe last tenant, save one, of that celebrated warehouse--the penultimate\nbankrupt--had followed the beaten road of puffing, and announced his\ngoods as the cheapest ever manufactured. According to himself, his\nhandbills, and his advertisements, everything contained in that shop was\nso very much under prime cost, that the more he sold the sooner he must\nbe ruined. To hear him, you would expect not only that he should give\nhis ribbons and muslins for nothing, but that he should offer you\na premium for consenting to accept of them. Gloves, handkerchiefs,\nnightcaps, gown-pieces, every article at the door and in the window was\ncovered with tickets, each nearly as large as itself, tickets that might\nbe read across the market-place; and townspeople and country-people came\nflocking round about, some to stare and some to buy. The starers were,\nhowever, it is to be presumed, more numerous than the buyers, for\nnotwithstanding his tickets, his handbills, and his advertisements, in\nless than six months the advertiser had failed, and that stock never, as\nit's luckless owner used to say, approached for cheapness, was sold off\nat half its original price.\n\nWarned by his predecessor's fate, the next comer adopted a newer and a\nnobler style of attracting public attention. He called himself a steady\ntrader of the old school, abjured cheapness as synonymous with cheating,\ndisclaimed everything that savoured of a puff, denounced handbills and\nadvertisements, and had not a ticket in his whole shop. He cited the\nhigh price of his articles as proofs of their goodness, and would have\nheld himself disgraced for ever if he had been detected in selling\na reasonable piece of goods. \"He could not,\" he observed, \"expect to\nattract the rabble by such a mode of transacting business; his aim was\nto secure a select body of customers amongst the nobility and gentry,\npersons who looked to quality and durability in their purchases, and\nwere capable of estimating the solid advantages of dealing with a\ntradesman who despised the trumpery artifices of the day.\"\n\nSo high-minded a declaration, enforced too by much solemnity of\nutterance and appearance--the speaker being a solid, substantial,\nmiddle-aged man, equipped in a full suit of black, with a head nicely\npowdered, and a pen stuck behind his ear--such a declaration from so\nimportant a personage ought to have succeeded; but somehow or other\nit did not. His customers, gentle and simple, were more select than\nnumerous, and in another six months the high-price man failed just as\nthe low-price man had failed before him.\n\nTheir successor, Mr. Joseph Hanson, claimed to unite in his own person\nthe several merits of both his antecedents. Cheaper than the cheapest,\nbetter, finer, more durable, than the best, nothing at all approaching\nhis assortment of linendrapery had, as he swore, and his head shopman,\nMr. Thomas Long, asseverated, ever been seen before in the streets of\nBelford Regis; and the oaths of the master and the asseverations of\nthe man, together with a very grand display of fashions and finery, did\nreally seem, in the first instance at least, to attract more customers\nthan had of late visited those unfortunate premises.\n\nMr. Joseph Hanson and Mr. Thomas Long were a pair admirably suited\nto the concern, and to one another. Each possessed pre-eminently the\nvarious requisites and qualifications in which the other happened to\nbe deficient. Tall, slender, elderly, with a fine bald head, a mild\ncountenance, a most insinuating address, and a general air of\nfaded gentility, Mr. Thomas Long was exactly the foreman to give\nrespectability to his employer; whilst bold, fluent, rapid, loud,\ndashing in aspect and manner, with a great fund of animal spirits, and\na prodigious stock of assurance and conceit, respectability was, to\nsay the truth, the precise qualification which Mr. Joseph Hanson most\nneeded.\n\nThen the good town of Belford being divided, like most other country\ntowns, into two prevailing factions, theological and political, the\nworthies whom I am attempting to describe prudently endeavoured to catch\nall parties by embracing different sides; Mr. Joseph Hanson being a\ntory and high-churchman of the very first water, who showed his loyalty\naccording to the most approved faction, by abusing his Majesty's\nministers as revolutionary, thwarting the town-council, getting tipsy\nat conservative dinners, and riding twenty miles to attend an eminent\npreacher who wielded in a neighbouring county all the thunders of\northodoxy; whilst the soft-spoken Mr. Thomas Long was a Dissenter and a\nradical, who proved his allegiance to the House of Brunswick (for both\nclaimed to be amongst the best wishers to the present dynasty and\nthe reigning sovereign) by denouncing the government as weak and\naristocratic, advocating the abolition of the peerage, getting up an\noperative reform club, and going to chapel three times every Sunday.\n\nThese measures succeeded so well, that the allotted six months (the\ngeneral period of failure in that concern) elapsed, and still found\nMr. Joseph Hanson as flourishing as ever in manner, and apparently\nflourishing in trade; they stood him, too, in no small stead, in a\nmatter which promised to be still more conducive to his prosperity\nthan buying and selling feminine gear,--in the grand matter (for Joseph\njocosely professed to be a forlorn bachelor upon the lookout for a wife)\nof a wealthy marriage.\n\nOne of the most thrifty and thriving tradesmen in the town of Belford,\nwas old John Parsons, the tinman. His spacious shop, crowded with its\nglittering and rattling commodities, pots, pans, kettles, meat-covers,\nin a word, the whole _batterie de cuisine_, was situate in the narrow,\ninconvenient lane called Oriel Street, which I have already done myself\nthe honour of introducing to the courteous reader, standing betwixt a\ngreat chemist on one side, his windows filled with coloured jars, red,\nblue, and green, looking like painted glass, or like the fruit made of\ngems in Aladdin's garden, (I am as much taken myself with those jars\nin a chemist's window as ever was Miss Edgeworth's Rosamond,) and an\neminent china warehouse on the other; our tinman having the honour to be\nnext-door neighbour to no less a lady than Mrs. Philadelphia Tyler. Many\na thriving tradesman might be found in Oriel Street, and many a blooming\ndamsel amongst the tradesmen's daughters; but if the town gossip might\nbe believed, the richest of all the rich shopkeepers was old John\nParsons, and the prettiest girl (even without reference to her father's\nmoneybags) was his fair daughter Harriet.\n\nJohn Parsons was one of those loud, violent, blustering, boisterous\npersonages who always put me in mind of the description so often\nappended to characters of that sort in the dramatis person\u00e6 of Beaumont\nand Fletcher's plays, where one constantly meets with Ernulpho\nor Bertoldo, or some such Italianised appellation, \"an old angry\ngentleman.\" The \"old angry gentleman\" of the fine old dramatists\ngenerally keeps the promise of the play-bill. He storms and rails during\nthe whole five acts, scolding those the most whom he loves the best,\nmaking all around him uncomfortable, and yet meaning fully to do right,\nand firmly convinced that he is himself the injured party; and after\nquarrelling with cause or without to the end of the comedy, makes\nfriends all round at the conclusion;--a sort of person whose good\nintentions everybody appreciates, but from whose violence everybody that\ncan is sure to get away.\n\nNow such men are just as common in the real workaday world as in the old\ndrama; and precisely such a man was John Parsons.\n\nHis daughter was exactly the sort of creature that such training was\ncalculated to produce; gentle, timid, shrinking, fond of her father, who\nindeed doated upon her, and would have sacrificed his whole substance,\nhis right arm, his life, anything except his will or his humour, to give\nher a moment's pleasure; gratefully fond of her father, but yet more\nafraid than fond.\n\nThe youngest and only surviving child of a large family, and brought\nup without a mother's care, since Mrs. Parsons had died in her\ninfancy, there was a delicacy and fragility, a slenderness of form and\ntransparency of complexion, which, added to her gentleness and modesty,\ngave an unexpected elegance to the tinman's daughter. A soft appealing\nvoice, dove-like eyes, a smile rather sweet than gay, a constant desire\nto please, and a total unconsciousness of her own attractions, were\namongst her chief characteristics. Some persons hold the theory that\ndissimilarity answers best in matrimony, and such persons would have\nfound a most satisfactory contrast of appearance, mind, and manner,\nbetween the fair Harriet and her dashing suitor.\n\nBesides his one great and distinguishing quality of assurance and vulgar\npretension, which it is difficult to describe, by any word short of\nimpudence, Mr. Joseph Hanson was by no means calculated to please\nthe eye of a damsel of seventeen, an age at which a man who owned to\nfive-and-thirty, and who looked and most probably was at least ten years\nfarther advanced on the journey of life, would not fail to be set down\nas a confirmed old bachelor. He had, too, a large mouth, full of large\nirregular teeth, a head of hair which bore a great resemblance to a wig,\nand a suspicion of a squint, (for it did not quite amount to that odious\ndeformity,) which added a most sinister expression to his countenance.\nHarriet Parsons could not abide him; and I verily believe she would have\ndisliked him just as much though a certain Frederick Mallet had never\nbeen in existence.\n\nHow her father, a dissenter, a radical, and a steady tradesman of the\nold school, who hated puffs and puffery, and finery and fashion, came to\nbe taken in by a man opposed to him in religion and politics, in action\nand in speech, was a riddle that puzzled half the gossips in Belford. It\nhappened through a mutual enmity, often (to tell an unpalatable truth of\npoor human nature) a stronger bond of union than a mutual affection.\n\nThus it fell out.\n\nAmongst the reforms carried into effect by the town-council, whereof\nJohn Parsons was a leading member, was the establishment of an efficient\nnew police to replace the incapable old watchmen, who had hitherto been\nthe sole guardians of life and property in our ancient borough. As far\nas the principle went, the liberal party were united and triumphant.\nThey split, as liberals are apt to split, upon the rock of detail. It\nso happened that a turnpike, belonging to one of the roads leading into\nBelford, had been removed, by order of the commissioners, half a mile\nfarther from the town;--half a mile indeed beyond the town boundary;\nand although there were only three houses, one a beer-shop, and the two\nothers small tenements inhabited by labouring people, between the site\nof the old turnpike at the end of Prince's Street, and that of the new,\nat the King's Head Pond, our friend the tinman, who was nothing if not\ncrotchetty, insisted with so much pertinacity upon the perambulation of\nthe blue-coated officials appointed for that beat, being extended along\nthe highway for the distance aforesaid, that the whole council were set\ntogether by the ears, and the measure had very nearly gone by the board\nin consequence. The imminence of the peril saved them. The danger of\nreinstating the ancient Dogberrys of the watch, and still worse,\nof giving a triumph to the tories, brought the reformers to their\nsenses--all except the man of tin, who, becoming only the more confirmed\nin his own opinion as ally after ally fell off from him, persisted in\ndividing the council six different times, and had the gratification of\nfinding himself on each of the three last divisions, in a minority of\none. He was about to bring forward the question upon a seventh occasion,\nwhen a hint as to the propriety in such case of moving a vote of censure\nagainst him for wasting the time of the board, caused him to secede from\nthe council in a fury, and to quarrel with the whole municipal body,\nfrom the mayor downward.\n\nNow the mayor, a respectable and intelligent attorney, heretofore John\nParsons' most intimate friend, happened to have been brought publicly\nand privately into collision with Mr. Joseph Hanson, who, delighted to\nfind an occasion on which he might at once indulge his aversion to the\ncivic dignitary, and promote the interest of his love-suit, was not\ncontent with denouncing the corporation _de vive voi\u00e6_, but wrote three\ngrandiloquent letters to the Belford Courant, in which he demonstrated\nthat the welfare of the borough, and the safety of the constitution,\ndepended upon the police parading regularly, by day and by night, along\nthe high road to the King's Head Pond, and that none but a pettifogging\nchief magistrate, and an incapable town-council, corrupt tools of a\ncorrupt administration, could have had the gratuitous audacity to cause\nthe policeman to turn at the top of Prince's Street, thereby leaving\nthe persons and property of his majesty's liege subjects unprotected\nand uncared for. He enlarged upon the fact of the tenements in question\nbeing occupied by agricultural labourers, a class over whom, as he\nobserved, the demagogues now in power delighted to tyrannise; and\nconcluded his flourishing appeal to the conservatives of the borough,\nthe county, and the empire at large, by a threat of getting up a\npetition against the council, and bringing the whole affair before the\ntwo Houses of Parliament.\n\nAlthough this precious epistle was signed Amicus Patri\u00e6, the writer\nwas far too proud of his production to entrench himself behind\nthe inglorious shield of a fictitious signature, and as the mayor,\nprofessionally indignant at the epithet pettifogging, threatened both\nthe editor of the Belford Courant and Mr. Joseph Hanson with an action\nfor libel, it followed, as matter of course, that John Parsons not only\nthought the haberdasher the most able and honest man in the borough, but\nregarded him as the champion, if not the martyr, of his cause, and one\nwho deserved everything that he had to bestow, even to the hand and\nportion of the pretty Harriet.\n\nAffairs were in this posture, when one fine morning the chief magistrate\nof Belford entered the tinman's shop.\n\n\"Mr. Parsons,\" said the worthy dignitary, in a very conciliatory tone,\n\"you may be as angry with me as you like, but I find from our good vicar\nthat the fellow Hanson has applied to him for a licence, and I cannot\nlet you throw away my little friend Harriet without giving you warning,\nthat a long and bitter repentance will follow such a union. There are\nemergencies in which it becomes a duty to throw aside professional\nniceties, and to sacrifice etiquette to the interests of an old\nfriendship; and I tell you, as a prudent man, that I know of my own\nknowledge that this intended son-in-law of your's will be arrested\nbefore the wedding-day.\"\n\n\"I'll bail him,\" said John Parsons, stoutly.\n\n\"He is not worth a farthing,\" quoth the chief magistrate.\n\n\"I shall give him ten thousand pounds with my daughter,\" answered the\nman of pots and kettles.\n\n\"I doubt if ten thousand pounds will pay his just debts,\" rejoined the\nmayor.\n\n\"Then I'll give him twenty,\" responded the tinman.\n\n\"He has failed in five different places within the last five years,\"\npersisted the pertinacious adviser; \"has run away from his creditors,\nHeaven knows how often; has taken the benefit of the Act time after\ntime! You would not give your own sweet Harriet, the best and prettiest\ngirl in the county, to an adventurer, the history of whose life is to\nbe found in the Gazette and the Insolvent Court, and who is a high\nchurchman and a tory to boot. Surely you would not fling away your\ndaughter and your honest earnings upon a man of notorious bad character,\nwith whom you have not an opinion or a prejudice in common? Just think\nwhat the other party will say!\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Mr. Mallet or Mr. Mayor, if you prefer the sound of\nyour new dignity,\" broke out John Parsons, in a fury, \"I shall do what\nI like with my money and my daughter, without consulting you, or caring\nwhat anybody may chance to say, whether whig or tory. For my part, I\nthink there's little to choose between them. One side's as bad as the\nother. Tyrants in office and patriots out. If Hanson is a conservative\nand a churchman, his foreman is a radical and a dissenter; and they\nneither of them pretend to dictate to their betters, which is more than\nI can say of some who call themselves reformers. Once for all, I tell\nyou that he shall marry my Harriet, and that your nephew sha'n't: so\nnow you may arrest him as soon as you like. I'm not to be managed\nhere, however you and your tools may carry matters at the Town Hall. An\nEnglishman's house is his castle.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Mallet, \"I am going. God knows I came out of old\nfriendship towards yourself, and sincere affection for the dear girl\nyour daughter. As to my nephew, besides that I firmly believe the young\npeople like each other, I know him to be as steady a lad as ever drew a\nconveyance; and with what his father has left him, and what I can give\nhim, to say nothing of his professional prospects, he would be a fit\nmatch for Harriet as far as money goes. But if you are determined----\"\n\n\"I _am_ determined,\" roared John Parsons. \"Before next week is out,\nJoseph Hanson shall be my son-in-law. And now, sir, I advise you to go\nand drill your police.\" And the tinman retired from behind the counter\ninto the interior of his dwelling, (for this colloquy had taken place in\nthe shop,) banging the door behind him with a violence that really shook\nthe house.\n\n\"Poor pretty Harriet!\" thought the compassionate chief magistrate, \"and\npoor Frederick too! The end of next week! This is only Monday; something\nmay turn up in that time; we must make inquiries; I had feared that it\nwould have been earlier. My old tetchy friend here is just the man to\nhave arranged the marriage one day, and had the ceremony performed the\nnext. We must look about us.\" And full of such cogitations, the mayor\nreturned to his habitation.\n\nOn the Thursday week after this conversation a coach drew up, about\neight o'clock in the morning, at the gate of St Stephen's churchyard,\nand Mr. Joseph Hanson, in all the gloss of bridal finery, newly clad\nfrom top to toe, smiling and smirking at every instant, jumped down,\nfollowed by John Parsons, and prepared to hand out his reluctant bride\nelect, when Mr. Mallet, with a showy-looking middle-aged woman (a sort\nof feminine of Joseph himself) hanging upon his arm, accosted our friend\nthe tinman.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried the mayor.\n\n\"What for?\" inquired John Parsons. \"If it's a debt, I've already told\nyou that I'll be his bail.\"\n\n\"It is a debt,\" responded the chief magistrate; \"and one that luckily he\nmust pay, and not you. Three years ago he married this lady at Liverpool\nWe have the certificate and all the documents.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" added the injured fair one; \"and I find that he has another\nwife in Dublin, and a third at Manchester. I have heard, too, that he\nran away with a young lady to Scotland; but that don't count, as he was\nunder age.\"\n\n\"Four wives!\" ejaculated John Parsons, in a transport of astonishment\nand indignation. \"Why the man is an absolute great Turk! But the\nthing's impossible. Come and answer for yourself, Joseph Hanson.\"\n\nAnd the tinman turned to look for his intended son-in-law; but\nfrightened at the sight of the fair claimant of his hand and person, the\nbridegroom had absconded, and John Parsons and the mayor had nothing for\nit but to rejoin the pretty Harriet, smiling through her tears as she\nsate with her bride-maiden in the coach at the churchyard-gate.\n\n\"Well; it's a great escape! and we're for ever obliged to you, Mr.\nMayor. Don't cry any more, Harriet. If Frederick was but here, why, in\nspite of the policemen---- but a week hence will do as well; and I am\nbeginning to be of Harriet's mind, that even if he had not had three or\nfour wives, we should be well off to be fairly rid of Mr. Joseph Hanson,\nthe puffing haberdasher.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
