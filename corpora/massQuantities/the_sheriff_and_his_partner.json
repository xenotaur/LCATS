    "body": "One afternoon in July, 1869, I was seated at my desk in Locock\u2019s\nlaw-office in the town of Kiota, Kansas. I had landed in New York from\nLiverpool nearly a year before, and had drifted westwards seeking in\nvain for some steady employment. Lawyer Locock, however, had promised to\nlet me study law with him, and to give me a few dollars a month besides,\nfor my services as a clerk. I was fairly satisfied with the prospect,\nand the little town interested me. An outpost of civilization, it was\nsituated on the border of the great plains, which were still looked\nupon as the natural possession of the nomadic Indian tribes. It owed its\nimportance to the fact that it lay on the cattle-trail which led from\nthe prairies of Texas through this no man\u2019s land to the railway system,\nand that it was the first place where the cowboys coming north could\nfind a bed to sleep in, a bar to drink at, and a table to gamble on. For\nsome years they had made of Kiota a hell upon earth. But gradually the\nland in the neighbourhood was taken up by farmers, emigrants chiefly\nfrom New England, who were determined to put an end to the reign of\nviolence. A man named Johnson was their leader in establishing order\nand tranquillity. Elected, almost as soon as he came to the town, to the\ndangerous post of City Marshal, he organized a vigilance committee\nof the younger and more daring settlers, backed by whom he resolutely\nsuppressed the drunken rioting of the cowboys. After the ruffians\nhad been taught to behave themselves, Johnson was made Sheriff of the\nCounty, a post which gave him a house and permanent position. Though\nmarried now, and apparently \u201csettled down,\u201d the Sheriff was a sort of\nhero in Kiota. I had listened to many tales about him, showing desperate\ndetermination veined with a sense of humour, and I often regretted that\nI had reached the place too late to see him in action. I had little\nor nothing to do in the office. The tedium of the long days was almost\nunbroken, and Stephen\u2019s \u201cCommentaries\u201d had become as monotonous and\nunattractive as the bare uncarpeted floor. The heat was tropical, and\nI was dozing when a knock startled me. A negro boy slouched in with a\nbundle of newspapers: \u201cThis yer is Jedge Locock\u2019s, I guess?\u201d \u201cI guess\nso,\u201d was my answer as I lazily opened the third or fourth number of\nthe \u201cKiota Weekly Tribune.\u201d Glancing over the sheet my eye caught the\nfollowing paragraph:\n\n     \u201cHIGHWAY ROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE.\n\n     JUDGE SHANNON STOPPED.\n\n     THE OUTLAW ESCAPES. HE KNOWS SHERIFF JOHNSON.\n\n\u201cInformation has just reached us of an outrage perpetrated on the person\nof one of our most respected fellow-citizens. The crime was committed in\ndaylight, on the public highway within four miles of this city; a crime,\ntherefore, without parallel in this vicinity for the last two years.\nFortunately our County and State authorities can be fully trusted,\nand we have no sort of doubt that they can command, if necessary, the\nsuccour and aid of each and every citizen of this locality in order to\nbring the offending miscreant to justice.\n\n\u201cWe now place the plain recital of this outrage before our readers.\n\n\u201cYesterday afternoon, as Ex-Judge Shannon was riding from his law-office\nin Kiota towards his home on Sumach Bluff, he was stopped about four\nmiles from this town by a man who drew a revolver on him, telling him\nat the same time to pull up. The Judge, being completely unarmed and\nunprepared, obeyed, and was told to get down from the buckboard, which\nhe did. He was then ordered to put his watch and whatever money he had,\nin the road, and to retreat three paces.\n\n\u201cThe robber pocketed the watch and money, and told him he might tell\nSheriff Johnson that Tom Williams had \u2018gone through him,\u2019 and that he\n(Williams) could be found at the saloon in Osawotamie at any time. The\nJudge now hoped for release, but Tom Williams (if that be the robber\u2019s\nreal name) seemed to get an afterthought, which he at once proceeded to\ncarry into effect. Drawing a knife he cut the traces, and took out of\nthe shafts the Judge\u2019s famous trotting mare, Lizzie D., which he mounted\nwith the remark:\n\n\u201c\u2018Sheriff Johnson, I reckon, would come after the money anyway, but the\nhoss\u2019ll fetch him--sure pop.\u2019\n\n\u201cThese words have just been given to us by Judge Shannon himself, who\ntells us also that the outrage took place on the North Section Line,\nbounding Bray\u2019s farm.\n\n\u201cAfter this speech the highway robber Williams rode towards the township\nof Osawotamie, while Judge Shannon, after drawing the buckboard to the\nedge of the track, was compelled to proceed homewards on foot.\n\n\u201cThe outrage, as we have said, took place late last evening, and Judge\nShannon, we understand, did not trouble to inform the County authorities\nof the circumstance till to-day at noon, after leaving our office.\nWhat the motive of the crime may have been we do not worry ourselves to\ninquire; a crime, an outrage upon justice and order, has been committed;\nthat is all we care to know. If anything fresh happens in this\nconnection we propose to issue a second edition of this paper. Our\nfellow-citizens may rely upon our energy and watchfulness to keep them\nposted.\n\n\u201cJust before going to press we learn that Sheriff Johnson was out of\ntown attending to business when Judge Shannon called; but Sub-Sheriff\nJarvis informs us that he expects the Sheriff back shortly. It is\nnecessary to add, by way of explanation, that Mr. Jarvis cannot leave\nthe jail unguarded, even for a few hours.\u201d\n\nAs may be imagined this item of news awakened my keenest interest. It\nfitted in with some things that I knew already, and I was curious to\nlearn more. I felt that this was the first act in a drama. Vaguely I\nremembered some one telling in disconnected phrases why the Sheriff had\nleft Missouri, and come to Kansas:\n\n\u201c\u2018Twas after a quor\u2019ll with a pardner of his, named Williams, who kicked\nout.\u201d\n\nBit by bit the story, to which I had not given much attention when I\nheard it, so casually, carelessly was it told, recurred to my memory.\n\n\u201cThey say as how Williams cut up rough with Johnson, and drawed a\nknife on him, which Johnson gripped with his left while he pulled\ntrigger.--Williams, I heerd, was in the wrong; I hain\u2019t perhaps got the\nright end of it; anyhow, you might hev noticed the Sheriff hes lost the\nlittle finger off his left hand.--Johnson, they say, got right up and\nlit out from Pleasant Hill. Perhaps the folk in Mizzoori kinder liked\nWilliams the best of the two; I don\u2019t know. Anyway, Sheriff Johnson\u2019s\na square man; his record here proves it. An\u2019 real grit, you bet your\nlife.\u201d\n\nThe narrative had made but a slight impression on me at the time; I\ndidn\u2019t know the persons concerned, and had no reason to interest myself\nin their fortunes. In those early days, moreover, I was often homesick,\nand gave myself up readily to dreaming of English scenes and faces. Now\nthe words and drawling intonation came back to me distinctly, and with\nthem the question: Was the robber of Judge Shannon the same Williams who\nhad once been the Sheriff\u2019s partner? My first impulse was to hurry into\nthe street and try to find out; but it was the chief part of my duty to\nstay in the office till six o\u2019clock; besides, the Sheriff was \u201cout of\ntown,\u201d and perhaps would not be back that day. The hours dragged to an\nend at last; my supper was soon finished, and, as night drew down, I\nhastened along the wooden side-walk of Washington Street towards the\nCarvell House. This hotel was much too large for the needs of the little\ntown; it contained some fifty bedrooms, of which perhaps half-a-dozen\nwere permanently occupied by \u201chigh-toned\u201d citizens, and a billiard-room\nof gigantic size, in which stood nine tables, as well as the famous bar.\nThe space between the bar, which ran across one end of the room, and\nthe billiard-tables, was the favourite nightly resort of the prominent\npoliticians and gamblers. There, if anywhere, my questions would be\nanswered.\n\nOn entering the billiard-room I was struck by the number of men who had\ncome together. Usually only some twenty or thirty were present, half\nof whom sat smoking and chewing about the bar, while the rest watched a\ngame of billiards or took a \u201clife\u201d in pool. This evening, however, the\nbilliard-tables were covered with their slate-coloured \u201cwraps,\u201d while\nat least a hundred and fifty men were gathered about the open space of\nglaring light near the bar. I hurried up the room, but as I approached\nthe crowd my steps grew slower, and I became half ashamed of my eager,\nobtrusive curiosity and excitement. There was a kind of reproof in the\nlazy, cool glance which one man after another cast upon me, as I went\nby. Assuming an air of indecision I threaded my way through the chairs\nuptilted against the sides of the billiard-tables. I had drained a glass\nof Bourbon whisky before I realized that these apparently careless men\nwere stirred by some emotion which made them more cautious, more silent,\nmore warily on their guard than usual. The gamblers and loafers, too,\nhad taken \u201cback seats\u201d this evening, whilst hard-working men of the\nfarmer class who did not frequent the expensive bar of the Carvell House\nwere to be seen in front. It dawned upon me that the matter was serious,\nand was being taken seriously.\n\nThe silence was broken from time to time by some casual remark of no\ninterest, drawled out in a monotone; every now and then a man invited\nthe \u201ccrowd\u201d to drink with him, and that was all. Yet the moral\natmosphere was oppressive, and a vague feeling of discomfort grew upon\nme. These men \u201cmeant business.\u201d\n\nPresently the door on my left opened--Sheriff Johnson came into the\nroom.\n\n\u201cGood evenin\u2019,\u201d he said; and a dozen voices, one after another, answered\nwith \u201cGood evenin\u2019! good evenin\u2019, Sheriff!\u201d A big frontiersman, however,\na horse-dealer called Martin, who, I knew, had been on the old vigilance\ncommittee, walked from the centre of the group in front of the bar to\nthe Sheriff, and held out his hand with:\n\n\u201cShake, old man, and name the drink.\u201d The Sheriff took the proffered\nhand as if mechanically, and turned to the bar with \u201cWhisky--straight.\u201d\n\nSheriff Johnson was a man of medium height, sturdily built. A broad\nforehead, and clear, grey-blue eyes that met everything fairly,\ntestified in his favour. The nose, however, was fleshy and snub. The\nmouth was not to be seen, nor its shape guessed at, so thickly did the\nbrown moustache and beard grow; but the short beard seemed rather to\nexaggerate than conceal an extravagant out jutting of the lower jaw,\nthat gave a peculiar expression of energy and determination to the face.\nHis manner was unobtrusively quiet and deliberate.\n\nIt was an unusual occurrence for Johnson to come at night to the\nbar-lounge, which was beginning to fall into disrepute among the\npuritanical or middle-class section of the community. No one, however,\nseemed to pay any further attention to him, or to remark the unusual\ncordiality of Martin\u2019s greeting. A quarter of an hour elapsed before\nanything of note occurred. Then, an elderly man whom I did not know,\na farmer, by his dress, drew a copy of the \u201cKiota Tribune\u201d from his\npocket, and, stretching it towards Johnson, asked with a very marked\nYankee twang:\n\n\u201cSheriff, hev yeou read this \u2018Tribune\u2019?\u201d\n\nWheeling half round towards his questioner, the Sheriff replied:\n\n\u201cYes, sir, I hev.\u201d A pause ensued, which was made significant to me by\nthe fact that the bar-keeper suspended his hand and did not pour out the\nwhisky he had just been asked to supply--a pause during which the two\nfaced each other; it was broken by the farmer saying:\n\n\u201cEz yeou wer out of town to-day, I allowed yeou might hev missed seein\u2019\nit. I reckoned yeou\u2019d come straight hyar before yeou went to hum.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Crosskey,\u201d rejoined the Sheriff, with slow emphasis; \u201cI went home\nfirst and came on hyar to see the boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d said Mr. Crosskey, as it seemed to me, half apologetically,\n\u201cknowin\u2019 yeou I guessed yeou ought to hear the facks,\u201d then, with some\nsuddenness, stretching out his hand, he added, \u201cI hev some way to go,\nan\u2019 my old woman \u2018ull be waitin\u2019 up fer me. Good night, Sheriff.\u201d The\nhands met while the Sheriff nodded: \u201cGood night, Jim.\u201d\n\nAfter a few greetings to right and left Mr. Crosskey left the bar.\nThe crowd went on smoking, chewing, and drinking, but the sense\nof expectancy was still in the air, and the seriousness seemed, if\nanything, to have increased. Five or ten minutes may have passed when a\nman named Reid, who had run for the post of Sub-Sheriff the year before,\nand had failed to beat Johnson\u2019s nominee Jarvis, rose from his chair and\nasked abruptly:\n\n\u201cSheriff, do you reckon to take any of us uns with you to-morrow?\u201d\n\nWith an indefinable ring of sarcasm in his negligent tone, the Sheriff\nanswered:\n\n\u201cI guess not, Mr. Reid.\u201d\n\nQuickly Reid replied: \u201cThen I reckon there\u2019s no use in us stayin\u2019;\u201d and\nturning to a small knot of men among whom he had been sitting, he added,\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, boys!\u201d\n\nThe men got up and filed out after their leader without greeting the\nSheriff in any way. With the departure of this group the shadow lifted.\nThose who still remained showed in manner a marked relief, and a\nmoment or two later a man named Morris, whom I knew to be a gambler by\nprofession, called out lightly:\n\n\u201cThe crowd and you\u2019ll drink with me, Sheriff, I hope? I want another\nglass, and then we won\u2019t keep you up any longer, for you ought to have a\nnight\u2019s rest with to-morrow\u2019s work before you.\u201d\n\nThe Sheriff smiled assent. Every one moved towards the bar, and\nconversation became general. Morris was the centre of the company, and\nhe directed the talk jokingly to the account in the \u201cTribune,\u201d making\nfun, as it seemed to me, though I did not understand all his allusions,\nof the editor\u2019s timidity and pretentiousness. Morris interested and\namused me even more than he amused the others; he talked like a man of\nsome intelligence and reading, and listening to him I grew light-hearted\nand careless, perhaps more careless than usual, for my spirits had been\nice-bound in the earlier gloom of the evening.\n\n\u201cFortunately our County and State authorities can be fully trusted,\u201d\n some one said.\n\n\u201cMark that \u2018fortunately\u2019, Sheriff,\u201d laughed Morris. \u201cThe editor was\nafraid to mention you alone, so he hitched the State on with you to\nlighten the load.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy!\u201d chimed in another of the gamblers, \u201cand the \u2018aid and succour of\neach and every citizen,\u2019 eh, Sheriff, as if you\u2019d take the whole town\nwith you. I guess two or three\u2019ll be enough fer Williams.\u201d\n\nThis annoyed me. It appeared to me that Williams had addressed a\npersonal challenge to the Sheriff, and I thought that Johnson should\nso consider it. Without waiting for the Sheriff to answer, whether in\nprotest or acquiescence, I broke in:\n\n\u201cTwo or three would be cowardly. One should go, and one only.\u201d At once I\nfelt rather than saw the Sheriff free himself from the group of men; the\nnext moment he stood opposite to me.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked sharply, holding me with keen eye and\nout-thrust chin--repressed passion in voice and look.\n\nThe antagonism of his bearing excited and angered me not a little. I\nreplied:\n\n\u201cI think it would be cowardly to take two or three against a single man.\nI said one should go, and I say so still.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d he sneered. \u201cI guess you\u2019d go alone, wouldn\u2019t you? to bring\nWilliams in?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were paid for it I should,\u201d was my heedless retort. As I spoke his\nface grew white with such passion that I instinctively put up my hands\nto defend myself, thinking he was about to attack me. The involuntary\nmovement may have seemed boyish to him, for thought came into his eyes,\nand his face relaxed; moving away he said quietly:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll set up drinks, boys.\u201d\n\nThey grouped themselves about him and drank, leaving me isolated. But\nthis, now my blood was up, only added to the exasperation I felt at his\ncontemptuous treatment, and accordingly I walked to the bar, and as\nthe only unoccupied place was by Johnson\u2019s side I went there and said,\nspeaking as coolly as I could:\n\n\u201cThough no one asks me to drink I guess I\u2019ll take some whisky,\nbar-keeper, if you please.\u201d\n\nJohnson was standing with his back to me, but when I spoke he looked\nround, and I saw, or thought I saw, a sort of curiosity in his gaze.\nI met his eye defiantly. He turned to the others and said, in his\nordinary, slow way:\n\n\u201cWall, good night, boys; I\u2019ve got to go. It\u2019s gittin\u2019 late, an\u2019 I\u2019ve had\nabout as much as I want.\u201d\n\nWhether he alluded to the drink or to my impertinence I was unable to\ndivine. Without adding a word he left the room amid a chorus of \u201cGood\nnight, Sheriff!\u201d With him went Martin and half-a-dozen more.\n\nI thought I had come out of the matter fairly well until I spoke to\nsome of the men standing near. They answered me, it is true, but in\nmonosyllables, and evidently with unwillingness. In silence I finished\nmy whisky, feeling that every one was against me for some inexplicable\ncause. I resented this and stayed on. In a quarter of an hour the rest\nof the crowd had departed, with the exception of Morris and a few of the\nsame kidney.\n\nWhen I noticed that these gamblers, outlaws by public opinion, held away\nfrom me, I became indignant. Addressing myself to Morris, I asked:\n\n\u201cCan you tell me, sir, for you seem to be an educated man, what I have\nsaid or done to make you all shun me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d he answered indifferently. \u201cYou took a hand in a game\nwhere you weren\u2019t wanted. And you tried to come in without ever having\npaid the _ante_, which is not allowed in any game--at least not in any\ngame played about here.\u201d\n\nThe allusion seemed plain; I was not only a stranger, but a foreigner;\nthat must be my offence. With a \u201cGood night, sir; good night,\nbarkeeper!\u201d I left the room.\n\nThe next morning I went as usual to the office. I may have been seated\nthere about an hour--it was almost eight o\u2019clock--when I heard a knock\nat the door.\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I said, swinging round in the American chair, to find myself\nface to face with Sheriff Johnson.\n\n\u201cWhy, Sheriff, come in!\u201d I exclaimed cheerfully, for I was relieved\nat seeing him, and so realized more clearly than ever that the\nunpleasantness of the previous evening had left in me a certain\nuneasiness. I was eager to show that the incident had no importance:\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you take a seat? and you\u2019ll have a cigar?--these are not bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he answered. \u201cNo, I guess I won\u2019t sit nor smoke jest\nnow.\u201d After a pause, he added, \u201cI see you\u2019re studyin\u2019; p\u2019r\u2019aps you\u2019re\nbusy to-day; I won\u2019t disturb you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t disturb me, Sheriff,\u201d I rejoined. \u201cAs for studying, there\u2019s\nnot much in it. I seem to prefer dreaming.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d he said, letting his eyes range round the walls furnished with\nLaw Reports bound in yellow calf, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess there\u2019s a big\nlot of readin\u2019 to do before a man gets through with all those.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I laughed, \u201cthe more I read the more clearly I see that law is\nonly a sermon on various texts supplied by common sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWall,\u201d he went on slowly, coming a pace or two nearer and speaking with\nincreased seriousness, \u201cI reckon you\u2019ve got all Locock\u2019s business to see\nafter: his clients to talk to; letters to answer, and all that; and when\nhe\u2019s on the drunk I guess he don\u2019t do much. I won\u2019t worry you any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t worry me,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019ve not had a letter to answer in\nthree days, and not a soul comes here to talk about business or anything\nelse. I sit and dream, and wish I had something to do out there in the\nsunshine. Your work is better than reading words, words--nothing but\nwords.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t busy; hain\u2019t got anything to do here that might keep you?\nNothin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a thing. I\u2019m sick of Blackstone and all Commentaries.\u201d\n\nSuddenly I felt his hand on my shoulder (moving half round in the\nchair, I had for the moment turned sideways to him), and his voice was\nsurprisingly hard and quick:\n\n\u201cThen I swear you in as a Deputy-Sheriff of the United States, and of\nthis State of Kansas; and I charge you to bring in and deliver at the\nSheriff\u2019s house, in this county of Elwood, Tom Williams, alive or dead,\nand--there\u2019s your fee, five dollars and twenty-five cents!\u201d and he laid\nthe money on the table.\n\nBefore the singular speech was half ended I had swung round facing him,\nwith a fairly accurate understanding of what he meant But the moment\nfor decision had come with such sharp abruptness, that I still did not\nrealize my position, though I replied defiantly as if accepting the\ncharge:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not got a weapon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe boys allowed you mightn\u2019t hev, and so I brought some along. You ken\nsuit your hand.\u201d While speaking he produced two or three revolvers of\ndifferent sizes, and laid them before me.\n\nDazed by the rapid progress of the plot, indignant, too, at the trick\nplayed upon me, I took up the nearest revolver and looked at it almost\nwithout seeing it. The Sheriff seemed to take my gaze for that of an\nexpert\u2019s curiosity.\n\n\u201cIt shoots true,\u201d he said meditatively, \u201cplumb true; but it\u2019s too small\nto drop a man. I guess it wouldn\u2019t stop any one with grit in him.\u201d\n\nMy anger would not allow me to consider his advice; I thrust the weapon\nin my pocket:\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got a buggy. How am I to get to Osawotamie?\u201d\n\n\u201cMine\u2019s hitched up outside. You ken hev it.\u201d\n\nRising to my feet I said: \u201cThen we can go.\u201d\n\nWe had nearly reached the door of the office, when the Sheriff stopped,\nturned his back upon the door, and looking straight into my eyes said:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play foolish. You\u2019ve no call to go. Ef you\u2019re busy, ef you\u2019ve\ngot letters to write, anythin\u2019 to do--I\u2019ll tell the boys you sed so, and\nthat\u2019ll be all; that\u2019ll let you out.\u201d\n\nHalf-humorously, as it seemed to me, he added: \u201cYou\u2019re young and a\ntenderfoot. You\u2019d better stick to what you\u2019ve begun upon. That\u2019s the way\nto do somethin\u2019.--I often think it\u2019s the work chooses us, and we\u2019ve just\ngot to get down and do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you I had nothing to do,\u201d I retorted angrily; \u201cthat\u2019s the\ntruth. Perhaps\u201d (sarcastically) \u201cthis work chooses me.\u201d\n\nThe Sheriff moved away from the door.\n\nOn reaching the street I stopped for a moment in utter wonder. At that\nhour in the morning Washington Street was usually deserted, but now\nit seemed as if half the men in the town had taken up places round the\nentrance to Locock\u2019s office stairs. Some sat on barrels or boxes tipped\nup against the shop-front (the next store was kept by a German, who sold\nfruit and eatables); others stood about in groups or singly; a few were\nseated on the edge of the side-walk, with their feet in the dust of the\nstreet. Right before me and most conspicuous was the gigantic figure\nof Martin. He was sitting on a small barrel in front of the Sheriff\u2019s\nbuggy.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said in the air, but no one answered me. Mastering\nmy irritation, I went forward to undo the hitching-strap, but Martin,\ndivining my intention, rose and loosened the buckle. As I reached him,\nhe spoke in a low whisper, keeping his back turned to me:\n\n\u201cShoot off a joke quick. The boys\u2019ll let up on you then. It\u2019ll be all\nright. Say something for God\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\nThe rough sympathy did me good, relaxed the tightness round my heart;\nthe resentment natural to one entrapped left me, and some of my\nself-confidence returned:\n\n\u201cI never felt less like joking in my life, Martin, and humour can\u2019t be\nproduced to order.\u201d\n\nHe fastened up the hitching-strap, while I gathered the reins together\nand got into the buggy. When I was fairly seated he stepped to the\nside of the open vehicle, and, holding out his hand, said, \u201cGood day,\u201d\n adding, as our hands clasped, \u201cWade in, young un; wade in.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood day, Martin. Good day, Sheriff. Good day, boys!\u201d\n\nTo my surprise there came a chorus of answering \u201cGood days!\u201d as I drove\nup the street.\n\nA few hundred yards I went, and then wheeled to the right past the post\noffice, and so on for a quarter of a mile, till I reached the descent\nfrom the higher ground, on which the town was built, to the river.\nThere, on my left, on the verge of the slope, stood the Sheriffs house\nin a lot by itself, with the long, low jail attached to it. Down the\nhill I went, and across the bridge and out into the open country. I\ndrove rapidly for about five miles--more than halfway to Osawotamie--and\nthen I pulled up, in order to think quietly and make up my mind.\n\nI grasped the situation now in all its details. Courage was the one\nvirtue which these men understood, the only one upon which they prided\nthemselves. I, a stranger, a \u201ctenderfoot,\u201d had questioned the courage\nof the boldest among them, and this mission was their answer to my\ninsolence. The \u201cboys\u201d had planned the plot; Johnson was not to blame;\nclearly he wanted to let me out of it; he would have been satisfied\nthere in the office if I had said that I was busy; he did not like to\nput his work on any one else. And yet he must profit by my going. Were I\nkilled, the whole country would rise against Williams; whereas if I shot\nWilliams, the Sheriff would be relieved of the task. I wondered whether\nthe fact of his having married made any difference to the Sheriff.\nPossibly--and yet it was not the Sheriff; it was the \u201cboys\u201d who had\ninsisted on giving me the lesson. Public opinion was dead against me. \u201cI\nhad come into a game where I was not wanted, and I had never even paid\nthe _ante_\u201d--that was Morris\u2019s phrase. Of course it was all clear now.\nI had never given any proof of courage, as most likely all the rest had\nat some time or other. That was the _ante_ Morris meant....\n\nMy wilfulness had got me into the scrape; I had only myself to thank.\nNot alone the Sheriff but Martin would have saved me had I profited by\nthe door of escape which he had tried to open for me. Neither of them\nwished to push the malice to the point of making me assume the Sheriff\u2019s\nrisk, and Martin at least, and probably the Sheriff also, had taken\nmy quick, half-unconscious words and acts as evidence of reckless\ndetermination. If I intended to live in the West I must go through with\nthe matter.\n\nBut what nonsense it all was! Why should I chuck away my life in the\nattempt to bring a desperate ruffian to justice? And who could say that\nWilliams was a ruffian? It was plain that his quarrel with the Sheriff\nwas one of old date and purely personal He had \u201cstopped\u201d Judge Shannon\nin order to bring about a duel with the Sheriff. Why should I fight the\nSheriff\u2019s duels? Justice, indeed! justice had nothing to do with this\naffair; I did not even know which man was in the right. Reason led\ndirectly to the conclusion that I had better turn the horse\u2019s head\nnorthwards, drive as fast and as far as I could, and take the train as\nsoon as possible out of the country. But while I recognized that this\nwas the only sensible decision, I felt that I could not carry it into\naction. To run away was impossible; my cheeks burned with shame at the\nthought.\n\nWas I to give my life for a stupid practical joke? \u201cYes!\u201d--a voice\nwithin me answered sharply. \u201cIt would be well if a man could always\nchoose the cause for which he risks his life, but it may happen that he\nought to throw it away for a reason that seems inadequate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat ought I to do?\u201d I questioned.\n\n\u201cGo on to Osawotamie, arrest Williams, and bring him into Kiota,\u201d\n replied my other self.\n\n\u201cAnd if he won\u2019t come?\u201d\n\n\u201cShoot him--you are charged to deliver him \u2018alive or dead\u2019 at the\nSheriff\u2019s house. No more thinking, drive straight ahead and act as if\nyou were a representative of the law and Williams a criminal. It has to\nbe done.\u201d\n\nThe resolution excited me, I picked up the reins and proceeded. At the\nnext section-line I turned to the right, and ten or fifteen minutes\nlater saw Osawotamie in the distance.\n\nI drew up, laid the reins on the dashboard, and examined the revolver.\nIt was a small four-shooter, with a large bore. To make sure of its\nefficiency I took out a cartridge; it was quite new. While weighing it\nin my hand, the Sheriff\u2019s words recurred to me, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t stop any\none with grit in him.\u201d What did he mean? I didn\u2019t want to think, so\nI put the cartridge in again, cocked and replaced the pistol in my\nright-side jacket pocket, and drove on. Osawotamie consisted of a single\nstreet of straggling frame-buildings. After passing half-a-dozen of\nthem I saw, on the right, one which looked to me like a saloon. It was\nevidently a stopping-place. There were several hitching-posts, and\nthe house boasted instead of a door two green Venetian blinds put upon\nrollers--the usual sign of a drinking-saloon in the West.\n\nI got out of the buggy slowly and carefully, so as not to shift the\nposition of the revolver, and after hitching up the horse, entered the\nsaloon. Coming out of the glare of the sunshine I could hardly see in\nthe darkened room. In a moment or two my eyes grew accustomed to the dim\nlight, and I went over to the bar, which was on my left. The bar-keeper\nwas sitting down; his head and shoulders alone were visible; I asked him\nfor a lemon squash.\n\n\u201cAnythin\u2019 in it?\u201d he replied, without lifting his eyes.\n\n\u201cNo; I\u2019m thirsty and hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guessed that was about the figger,\u201d he remarked, getting up leisurely\nand beginning to mix the drink with his back to me.\n\nI used the opportunity to look round the room. Three steps from me stood\na tall man, lazily leaning with his right arm on the bar, his fingers\ntouching a half-filled glass. He seemed to be gazing past me into\nthe void, and thus allowed me to take note of his appearance. In\nshirt-sleeves, like the bar-keeper, he had a belt on in which were two\nlarge revolvers with white ivory handles. His face was prepossessing,\nwith large but not irregular features, bronzed fair skin, hazel eyes,\nand long brown moustache. He looked strong and was lithe of form, as if\nhe had not done much hard bodily work. There was no one else in the room\nexcept a man who appeared to be sleeping at a table in the far corner\nwith his head pillowed on his arms.\n\nAs I completed this hasty scrutiny of the room and its inmates, the\nbar-keeper gave me my squash, and I drank eagerly. The excitement had\nmade me thirsty, for I knew that the crisis must be at hand, but I\nexperienced no other sensation save that my heart was thumping and my\nthroat was dry. Yawning as a sign of indifference (I had resolved to\nbe as deliberate as the Sheriff) I put my hand in my pocket on the\nrevolver. I felt that I could draw it out at once.\n\nI addressed the bar-keeper:\n\n\u201cSay, do you know the folk here in Osawotamie?\u201d\n\nAfter a pause he replied:\n\n\u201cMost on \u2018em, I guess.\u201d\n\nAnother pause and a second question:\n\n\u201cDo you know Tom Williams?\u201d\n\nThe eyes looked at me with a faint light of surprise in them; they\nlooked away again, and came back with short, half suspicious, half\ncurious glances.\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re a friend of his\u2019n?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know him, but I\u2019d like to meet him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you, though?\u201d Turning half round, the bar-keeper took down a\nbottle and glass, and poured out some whisky, seemingly for his own\nconsumption. Then: \u201cI guess he\u2019s not hard to meet, isn\u2019t Williams, ef\nyou and me mean the same man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess we do,\u201d I replied; \u201cTom Williams is the name.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d said the tall man who was leaning on the bar near me,\n\u201cthat\u2019s my name.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you the Williams that stopped Judge Shannon yesterday?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know his name,\u201d came the careless reply, \u201cbut I stopped a man\nin a buck-board.\u201d\n\nPlucking out my revolver, and pointing it low down on his breast, I\nsaid:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sent to arrest you; you must come with me to Kiota.\u201d\n\nWithout changing his easy posture, or a muscle of his face, he asked in\nthe same quiet voice:\n\n\u201cWhat does this mean, anyway? Who sent you to arrest me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSheriff Johnson,\u201d I answered.\n\nThe man started upright, and said, as if amazed, in a quick, loud voice:\n\n\u201cSheriff Johnson sent _you_ to arrest me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I retorted, \u201cSheriff Samuel Johnson swore me in this morning as\nhis deputy, and charged me to bring you into Kiota.\u201d\n\nIn a tone of utter astonishment he repeated my words, \u201cSheriff Samuel\nJohnson!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, \u201cSamuel Johnson, Sheriff of Elwood County.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee here,\u201d he asked suddenly, fixing me with a look of angry suspicion,\n\u201cwhat sort of a man is he? What does he figger like?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a little shorter than I am,\u201d I replied curtly, \u201cwith a brown beard\nand bluish eyes--a square-built sort of man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHell!\u201d There was savage rage and menace in the exclamation.\n\n\u201cYou kin put that up!\u201d he added, absorbed once more in thought. I paid\nno attention to this; I was not going to put the revolver away at his\nbidding. Presently he asked in his ordinary voice:\n\n\u201cWhat age man might this Johnson be?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout forty or forty-five, I should think.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd right off Sam Johnson swore you in and sent you to bring me into\nKiota--an\u2019 him Sheriff?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I replied impatiently, \u201cthat\u2019s so.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat God!\u201d he exclaimed, bringing his clenched right hand heavily down\non the bar. \u201cHere, Zeke!\u201d turning to the man asleep in the corner,\nand again he shouted \u201cZeke!\u201d Then, with a rapid change of manner, and\nspeaking irritably, he said to me:\n\n\u201cPut that thing up, I say.\u201d\n\nThe bar-keeper now spoke too: \u201cI guess when Tom sez you kin put it up,\nyou kin. You hain\u2019t got no use fur it.\u201d\n\nThe changes of Williams\u2019 tone from wonder to wrath and then to quick\nresolution showed me that the doubt in him had been laid, and that I\nhad but little to do with the decision at which he had arrived, whatever\nthat decision might be. I understood, too, enough of the Western spirit\nto know that he would take no unfair advantage of me. I therefore\nuncocked the revolver and put it back into my pocket. In the meantime\nZeke had got up from his resting-place in the corner and had made his\nway sleepily to the bar. He had taken more to drink than was good for\nhim, though he was not now really drunk.\n\n\u201cGive me and Zeke a glass, Joe,\u201d said Williams; \u201cand this gentleman,\ntoo, if he\u2019ll drink with me, and take one yourself with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the bar-keeper sullenly, \u201cI\u2019ll not drink to any damned\nfoolishness. An\u2019 Zeke won\u2019t neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, he will,\u201d Williams returned persuasively, \u201cand so\u2019ll you, Joe.\nYou aren\u2019t goin\u2019 back on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be just damned if I am,\u201d said the barkeeper, half-conquered.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you take, sir?\u201d Williams asked me.\n\n\u201cThe bar-keeper knows my figger,\u201d I answered, half-jestingly, not yet\nunderstanding the situation, but convinced that it was turning out\nbetter than I had expected.\n\n\u201cAnd you, Zeke?\u201d he went on.\n\n\u201cThe old pizen,\u201d Zeke replied.\n\n\u201cAnd now, Joe, whisky for you and me--the square bottle,\u201d he continued,\nwith brisk cheerfulness.\n\nIn silence the bar-keeper placed the drinks before us. As soon as the\nglasses were empty Williams spoke again, putting out his hand to Zeke at\nthe same time:\n\n\u201cGood-bye, old man, so long, but saddle up in two hours. Ef I don\u2019t come\nthen, you kin clear; but I guess I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Tom,\u201d replied the bar-keeper, taking the proffered hand,\nstill half-unwillingly, \u201cif you\u2019re stuck on it; but the game is to wait\nfor \u2018em here--anyway that\u2019s how I\u2019d play it.\u201d\n\nA laugh and shake of the head and Williams addressed me:\n\n\u201cNow, sir, I\u2019m ready if you are.\u201d We were walking towards the door, when\nZeke broke in:\n\n\u201cSay, Tom, ain\u2019t I to come along?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Zeke, I\u2019ll play this hand alone,\u201d replied Williams, and two minutes\nlater he and I were seated in the buggy, driving towards Kiota.\n\nWe had gone more than a mile before he spoke again. He began very\nquietly, as if confiding his thoughts to me:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make no mistake about this business--it ain\u2019t worth\nwhile. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, and Sheriff Samuel Johnson sent you, but,\nmaybe, ef you was to think you could kinder bring him before me. There\nmight be two of the name, the age, the looks--though it ain\u2019t likely.\u201d\n Then, as if a sudden inspiration moved him:\n\n\u201cWhere did he come from, this Sam Johnson, do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe he came from Pleasant Hill, Missouri. I\u2019ve heard that he left\nafter a row with his partner, and it seems to me that his partner\u2019s name\nwas Williams. But that you ought to know better than I do. By-the-bye,\nthere is one sign by which Sheriff Johnson can always be recognized;\nhe has lost the little finger of his left hand. They say he caught\nWilliams\u2019 bowie with that hand and shot him with the right. But why he\nhad to leave Missouri I don\u2019t know, if Williams drew first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m satisfied now,\u201d said my companion, \u201cbut I guess you hain\u2019t got that\nstory correct; maybe you don\u2019t know the cause of it nor how it began;\nmaybe Williams didn\u2019t draw fust; maybe he was in the right all the way\nthrough; maybe--but thar!--the first hand don\u2019t decide everythin\u2019. Your\nSheriffs the man--that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d\n\nAfter this no word was spoken for miles. As we drew near the bridge\nleading into the town of Kiota I remarked half-a-dozen men standing\nabout. Generally the place was deserted, so the fact astonished me a\nlittle. But I said nothing. We had scarcely passed over half the length\nof the bridge, however, when I saw that there were quite twenty men\nlounging around the Kiota end of it. Before I had time to explain\nthe matter to myself, Williams spoke: \u201cI guess he\u2019s got out all the\nvigilantes;\u201d and then bitterly: \u201cThe boys in old Mizzouri wouldn\u2019t\nbelieve this ef I told it on him, the dog-goned mean cuss.\u201d\n\nWe crossed the bridge at a walk (it was forbidden to drive faster over\nthe rickety structure), and toiled up the hill through the bystanders,\nwho did not seem to see us, though I knew several of them. When we\nturned to the right to reach the gate of the Sheriff\u2019s house, there\nwere groups of men on both sides. No one moved from his place; here and\nthere, indeed, one of them went on whittling.\n\nI drew up at the sidewalk, threw down the reins, and jumped out of the\nbuggy to hitch up the horse. My task was done.\n\nI had the hitching-rein loose in my hand, when I became conscious of\nsomething unusual behind me. I looked round--it was the stillness that\nforeruns the storm.\n\nWilliams was standing on the side-walk facing the low wooden fence, a\nrevolver in each hand, but both pointing negligently to the ground; the\nSheriff had just come down the steps of his house; in his hands also\nwere revolvers; his deputy, Jarvis, was behind him on the stoop.\n\nWilliams spoke first:\n\n\u201cSam Johnson, you sent for me, and I\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\nThe Sheriff answered firmly, \u201cI did!\u201d\n\nTheir hands went up, and crack! crack! crack! in quick succession, three\nor four or five reports--I don\u2019t know how many. At the first shots the\nSheriff fell forward on his face. Williams started to run along the\nside-walk; the groups of men at the corner, through whom he must pass,\nclosed together; then came another report, and at the same moment he\nstopped, turned slowly half round, and sank down in a heap like an empty\nsack.\n\nI hurried to him; he had fallen almost as a tailor sits, but his head\nwas between his knees. I lifted it gently; blood was oozing from a hole\nin the forehead. The men were about me; I heard them say:\n\n\u201cA derned good shot! Took him in the back of the head. Jarvis kin\nshoot!\u201d\n\nI rose to my feet. Jarvis was standing inside the fence supported by\nsome one; blood was welling from his bared left shoulder.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t much hurt,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I guess the Sheriff\u2019s got it bad.\u201d\n\nThe men moved on, drawing me with them, through the gate to where the\nSheriff lay. Martin turned him over on his back. They opened his shirt,\nand there on the broad chest were two little blue marks, each in the\ncentre of a small mound of pink flesh.\n\n4TH April, 1891.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
