    "body": "On Tenthmonth 1, 2457 A.D., at exactly 9 A.M. Planetary Federation\nTime--but with a permissible error of a millionth of a second either\nway--in the fifth sublevel of NewNew York Robot Postal Station 68,\nBlack Sorter gulped down ten thousand pieces of first-class mail.\n\nThis breakfast tidbit did not agree with the mail-sorting machine. It\nwas as if a robust dog had been fed a large chunk of good red meat with\na strychnine pill in it. Black Sorter's innards went _whirr-klunk_, a\nblue electric glow enveloped him, and he began to shake as if he might\nbreak loose from the concrete.\n\nHe desperately spat back over his shoulder a single envelope, gave\na great _huff_ and blew out toward the sorting tubes a medium-size\nsnowstorm consisting of the other nine thousand, nine hundred and\nninety-nine pieces of first-class mail chewed to confetti. Then, still\nconvulsed, he snapped up a fresh ten thousand and proceeded to chomp\nand grind on them. Black Sorter was rugged.\n\nThe rejected envelope was tongued up by Red Subsorter, who growled deep\nin his throat, said a very bad word, and passed it to Yellow Rerouter,\nwho passed it to Green Rerouter, who passed it to Brown Study, who\npassed it to Pink Wastebasket.\n\nUnlike Black Sorter, Pink Wastebasket was very delicate, though highly\nintuitive--the machine equivalent of a White Russian countess. She\nwas designed to scan in 3,137 codes, route special-delivery spacemail\nto interplanetary liners by messenger rocket, and distinguish 9s from\nupside-down 6s.\n\nPink Wastebasket haughtily inhaled the offending envelope and almost\ninstantly turned a bright crimson and began to tremble. After a few\nminutes, small atomic flames started to flicker from her mid-section.\n\nWhite Nursemaid Seven and Greasy Joe both received Pink Wastebasket's\ndistress signal and got there as fast as their wheels would roll them,\nbut the high-born machine's malady was beyond their simple skills of\noilcan and electroshock.\n\n\n\nThey summoned other machine-tending-and-repairing machines, ones far\nmore expert than themselves, but all were baffled. It was clear that\nPink Wastebasket, who continued to tremble and flicker uncontrollably,\nwas suffering from the equivalent of a major psychosis with severe\npsychosomatic symptoms. She spat a stream of filthy ions at Gray\nPsychiatrist, not recognizing her old friend.\n\nMeanwhile, the paper blizzard from Black Sorter was piling up in great\ndrifts between the dark pillars of the sublevel, and flurries had\nreached Pink Wastebasket's aristocratic area. An expedition of sturdy\nmachines, headed by two hastily summoned snowplows, was dispatched to\nimmobilize Black Sorter at all costs.\n\nPink Wastebasket, quivering like a demented hula dancer, was clearly\napproaching a crisis. Finally Gray Psychiatrist--after consulting with\nGreen Surgeon, and even then with an irritated reluctance, as if he\nwere calling in a witch-doctor--summoned a human being.\n\nThe human being walked respectfully around Pink Wastebasket several\ntimes and then gave her a nervous little poke with a rubber-handled\nprobe.\n\nPink Wastebasket gently regurgitated her last snack, turned dead\nwhite, gave a last flicker and shake, and expired. Black Coroner\nrecorded the immediate cause of death as tinkering by a human being.\n\nThe human being, a bald and scrawny one named Potshelter, picked up the\nenvelope responsible for all the trouble, stared at it incredulously,\nopened it with trembling fingers, scanned the contents briefly, gave\na great shriek and ran off at top speed, forgetting to hop on his\nperambulator, which followed him making anxious clucking noises.\n\nThe nearest human representative of the Solar Bureau of Investigation,\na rather wooden-looking man named Krumbine, also bald, recognized\nPotshelter as soon as the latter burst gasping into his office,\nsqueezing through the door while it was still dilating. The human\nbeings whose work took them among the Top Brass, as the upper-echelon\nmachines were sometimes referred to, formed a kind of human elite, just\none big nervous family.\n\n\"Sit down, Potshelter,\" the SBI Man said. \"Hold still a second so the\nchair can grab you. Hitch onto the hookah and choose a tranquilizer\nfrom the tray at your elbow. Whatever deviation you've uncovered can't\nbe that much of a danger to the planets. I imagine that when you leave\nthis office, the Solar Battle Fleet will still be orbiting peacefully\naround Luna.\"\n\n\"I seriously doubt that.\"\n\n\n\nPotshelter gulped a large lavender pill and took a deep breath.\n\"Krumbine, a letter turned up in the first-class mail this morning.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\"\n\n\"It is a letter from one person to another person.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\"\n\n\"The flow of advertising has been seriously interfered with. At a\nmodest estimate, three hundred million pieces of expensive first-class\nadvertising have already been chewed to rags and I'm not sure the Steel\nHelms--God bless 'em!--have the trouble in hand yet.\"\n\n\"Judas Priest!\"\n\n\"Naturally the poor machines weren't able to cope with the letter.\nIt was utterly outside their experience, beyond the furthest reach\nof their programming. It threw them into a terrible spasm. Pink\nWastebasket is dead and at this very instant, if we're lucky, three\npolice machines of the toughest blued steel are holding down Black\nSorter and putting a muzzle on him.\"\n\n\"Great Scott! It's incredible, Potshelter. And Pink Wastebasket dead?\nTake another tranquilizer, Potshelter, and hand over the tray.\"\n\nKrumbine received it with trembling fingers, started to pick up a big\npink pill but drew back his hand from it in sudden revulsion at its\ncolor and swallowed two blue oval ones instead. The man was obviously\nfighting to control himself.\n\nHe said unsteadily, \"I almost never take doubles, but this news you\nbring--Good Lord! I seem to recall a case where someone tried to\nsend a sound-tape through the mails, but that was before my time.\nIncidentally, is there any possibility that this is a letter sent by\none _group_ of persons to another group? A hive or a therapy group or a\nsocial club? That would be bad enough, of course, but--\"\n\n\"No, just one single person sending to another.\" Potshelter's\nexpression set in grimly solicitous lines. \"I can see you don't quite\nunderstand, Krumbine. This is not a sound-tape, but a letter written in\nletters. You know, letters, characters--like books.\"\n\n\"Don't mention books in this office!\" Krumbine drew himself up angrily\nand then slumped back. \"Excuse me, Potshelter, but I find this very\ndifficult to face squarely. Do I understand you to say that one person\nhas tried to use the mails to send a printed sheet of some sort to\nanother?\"\n\n\"Worse than that. A written letter.\"\n\n\"Written? I don't recognize the word.\"\n\n\"It's a way of making characters, of forming visual equivalents of\nsound, without using electricity. The writer, as he's called, employs\na black liquid and a pointed stick called a pen. I know about this\nbecause one hobby of mine is ancient means of communication.\"\n\n\n\nKrumbine frowned and shook his head. \"Communication is a dangerous\nbusiness, Potshelter, especially at the personal level. With you and\nme, it's all right, because we know what we're doing.\"\n\nHe picked up a third blue tranquilizer. \"But with most of the\nhive-folk, person-to-person communication is only a morbid form of\nadvertising, a dangerous travesty of normal newscasting--catharsis\nwithout the analyst, recitation without the teacher--a perversion of\npromotion employed in betraying and subverting.\"\n\nThe frown deepened as he put the blue pill in his mouth and chewed it.\n\"But about this pen--do you mean the fellow glues the pointed stick to\nhis tongue and then speaks, and the black liquid traces the vibrations\non the paper? A primitive non-electrical oscilloscope? Sloppy but\nconceivable, and producing a record of sorts of the spoken word.\"\n\n\"No, no, Krumbine.\" Potshelter nervously popped a square orange tablet\ninto his mouth. \"It's a hand-written letter.\"\n\nKrumbine watched him. \"I never mix tranquilizers,\" he boasted absently.\n\"Hand-written, eh? You mean that the message was imprinted on a hand?\nAnd the skin or the entire hand afterward detached and sent through\nthe mails in the fashion of a Martian reproach? A grisly find indeed,\nPotshelter.\"\n\n\"You still don't quite grasp it, Krumbine. The fingers of the hand move\nthe stick that applies the ink, producing a crude imitation of the\nprinted word.\"\n\n\"Diabolical!\" Krumbine smashed his fist down on the desk so that the\nfour phones and two-score microphones rattled. \"I tell you, Potshelter,\nthe SBI is ready to cope with the subtlest modern deceptions, but when\nfiends search out and revive tricks from the pre-Atomic Cave Era, it's\nalmost too much. But, Great Scott, I dally while the planets are in\ndanger. What's the sender's code on this hellish letter?\"\n\n\"No code,\" Potshelter said darkly, proferring the envelope. \"The return\naddress is--hand-written.\"\n\nKrumbine blanched as his eyes slowly traced the uneven lines in the\nupper left-hand corner:\n\n    _from_ Richard Rowe\n    215 West 10th St. (horizontal)\n    2837 Rocket Court (vertical)\n    Hive 37, NewNew York 319, N. Y.\n    Columbia, Terra\n\n\"Ugh!\" Krumbine said, shivering. \"Those crawling characters, those\nletters, as you call them, those _things_ barely enough like print\nto be readable--they seem to be on the verge of awakening all sorts\nof horrid racial memories. I find myself thinking of fur-clad\nwitch-doctors dipping long pointed sticks in bubbling black cauldrons.\nNo wonder Pink Wastebasket couldn't take it, brave girl.\"\n\n\n\nFirming himself behind his desk, he pushed a number of buttons and\nspoke long numbers and meaningful alphabetical syllables into several\nmicrophones. Banks of colored lights around the desk began to blink\nlike a theatre marquee sending Morse Code, while phosphorescent\narrows crawled purposefully across maps and space-charts and through\nthree-dimensional street diagrams.\n\n\"There!\" he said at last. \"The sender of the letter is being\napprehended and will be brought directly here. We'll see what sort\nof man this Richard Rowe is--if we can assume he's human. Seven\nprecautionary cordons are being drawn around his population station:\nthree composed of machines, two of SBI agents, and two consisting of\nhuman and mechanical medical-combat teams. Same goes for the intended\nrecipient of the letter. Meanwhile, a destroyer squadron of the Solar\nFleet has been detached to orbit over NewNew York.\"\n\n\"In case it becomes necessary to Z-Bomb?\" Potshelter asked grimly.\n\nKrumbine nodded. \"With all those villains lurking just outside the\nSolar System in their invisible black ships, with planeticide in their\nhearts, we can't be too careful. One word transmitted from one spy to\nanother and anything may happen. And we must bomb before they do, so\nas to contain our losses. Better one city destroyed than a traitor\non the loose who may destroy many cities. One hundred years ago,\nthree person-to-person postcards went through the mails--just three\npostcards, Potshelter!--and _pft_ went Schenectady, Hoboken, Cicero,\nand Walla Walla. Here, as long as you're mixing them, try one of these\noval blues--I find them best for steady swallowing.\"\n\nBells jangled. Krumbine grabbed up two phones, holding one to each ear.\nPotshelter automatically picked up a third. The ringing continued.\nKrumbine started to wedge one of his phones under his chin, nodded\nsharply at Potshelter and then toward a cluster of microphones at the\nend of the table. Potshelter picked up a fourth phone from behind them.\nThe ringing stopped.\n\nThe two men listened, looking doped, Krumbine with an eye fixed on\nthe sweep second hand of the large wall clock. When it had made one\nrevolution, he cradled his phones. Potshelter followed suit.\n\n\"I do like the simplicity of the new on-the-hour Puffyloaf\nphono-commercial,\" the latter remarked thoughtfully. \"The Bread That's\nLighter Than Air. Nice.\"\n\nKrumbine nodded. \"I hear they've had to add mass to the leadfoil\nwrapping to keep the loaves from floating off the shelves. Fact.\"\n\n\n\nHe cleared his throat. \"Too bad we can't listen to more\nphono-commercials, but even when there isn't a crisis on the agenda, I\nfind I have to budget my listening time. One minute per hour strikes a\nreasonable balance between duty and self-indulgence.\"\n\nThe nearest wall began to sing:\n\n    Mister J. Augustus Krumbine,\n    We all think you're fine, fine, fine, fine.\n    Now out of the skyey blue\n    Come some telegrams for you.\n\nThe wall opened to a small heart shape toward the center and a sheaf of\npale yellow envelopes arced out and plopped on the middle of the desk.\nKrumbine started to leaf through them, scanning the little transparent\nwindows.\n\n\"Hm, Electronic Soap ... Better Homes and Landing Platforms ...\nPsycho-Blinkers ... Your Girl Next Door ... Poppy-Woppies ...\nPoopsy-Woopsies....\"\n\nHe started to open an envelope, then, after a quick look around and an\napologetic smile at Potshelter, dumped them all on the disposal hopper,\nwhich gargled briefly.\n\n\"After all, there _is_ a crisis this morning,\" he said in a defensive\nvoice.\n\nPotshelter nodded absently. \"I can remember back before personalized\ndelivery and rhyming robots,\" he observed. \"But how I'd miss them\nnow--so much more distingu\u221a\u00a9 than the hives with their non-personalized\nradio, TV and stereo advertising. For that matter, I believe there are\nsome backward areas on Terra where the great advertising potential of\ntelephones and telegrams hasn't been fully realized and they are still\nused in part for personal communication. Now me, I've never in my life\nsent or received a message except on my walky-talky.\" He patted his\nbreast pocket.\n\nKrumbine nodded, but he was a trifle shocked and inclined to revise\nhis estimate of Potshelter's social status. Krumbine conducted his own\nsocial correspondence solely by telepathy. He shared with three other\nSBI officials a private telepath--a charming albino girl named Agnes.\n\n\"Yes, and it's a very handsome walky-talky,\" he assured Potshelter a\nlittle falsely. \"Suits you. I like the upswept antenna.\" He drummed\non the desk and swallowed another blue tranquilizer. \"Dammit, what's\nhappened to those machines? They ought to have the two spies here by\nnow. Did you notice that the second--the intended recipient of the\nletter, I mean--seems to be female? Another good Terran name, too, Jane\nDough. Hive in Upper Manhattan.\" He began to tap the envelope sharply\nagainst the desk. \"Dammit, where _are_ they?\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Potshelter said hesitantly, \"but I'm wondering why you\nhaven't read the message inside the envelope.\"\n\n\n\nKrumbine looked at him blankly. \"Great Scott, I assumed that at least\n_it_ was in some secret code, of course. Normally I'd have asked you to\nhave Pink Wastebasket try her skill on it, but....\" His eyes widened\nand his voice sank. \"You don't mean to tell me that it's--\"\n\nPotshelter nodded grimly. \"Hand-written, too. Yes.\"\n\nKrumbine winced. \"I keep trying to forget that aspect of the case.\" He\ndug out the message with shaking fingers, fumbled it open and read:\n\n    _Dear Jane_,\n\n    _It must surprise you that I know your name, for our hives are\n    widely separated. Do you recall day before yesterday when your\n    guided tour of Grand Central Spaceport got stalled because the\n    aide blew a fuse? I was the young man with hair in the tour behind\n    yours. You were a little frightened and a groupmistress was\n    reassuring you. The machine spoke your name._\n\n    _Since then I have been unable to forget you. When I go to sleep,\n    I dream of your face looking up sadly at the mistress's kindly\n    photocells. I don't know how to get in touch with you, but my\n    grandfather has told me stories his grandfather told him that\n    his grandfather told him about young men writing what he calls\n    love-letters to young ladies. So I am writing you a love-letter._\n\n    _I work in a first-class advertising house and I will slip this\n    love-letter into an outgoing ten-thousand-pack and hope._\n\n    _Do not be frightened of me, Jane. I am no caveman except for my\n    hair. I am not insane. I am emotionally disturbed, but in a way\n    that no machine has ever described to me. I want only your\n    happiness._\n\n    _Sincerely_,\n\n    _Richard Rowe_\n\nKrumbine slumped back in his chair, which braced itself manfully\nagainst him, and looked long and thoughtfully at Potshelter. \"Well, if\nthat's a code, it's certainly a fiendishly subtle one. You'd think he\nwas talking to his Girl Next Door.\"\n\nPotshelter nodded wonderingly. \"I only read as far as where they were\nplanning to blow up Grand Central Spaceport and all the guides in it.\"\n\n\"Judas Priest, I think I have it!\" Krumbine shot up. \"It's a pilot\nadvertisement--Boy Next Door or--that kind of thing--printed to look\nlike hand-writtening, which would make all the difference. And the\npilot copy got mailed by accident--which would mean there is no real\nRichard Rowe.\"\n\nAt that instant, the door dilated and two blue detective engines\nhustled a struggling young man into the office. He was slim, rather\nhandsome, had a bushy head of hair that had somehow survived evolution\nand radioactive fallout, and across the chest and back of his paper\nsinglet was neatly stamped: \"RICHARD ROWE.\"\n\nWhen he saw the two men, he stopped struggling and straightened up.\n\"Excuse me, gentlemen,\" he said, \"but these police machines must have\nmade a mistake. I've committed no crime.\"\n\nThen his gaze fell on the hand-addressed envelope on Krumbine's desk\nand he turned pale.\n\n\n\nKrumbine laughed harshly. \"No crime! No, not at all. Merely using the\nmails to communicate. Ha!\"\n\nThe young man shrank back. \"I'm sorry, sir.\"\n\n\"Sorry, he says! Do you realize that your insane prank has resulted\nin the destruction of perhaps a half-billion pieces of first-class\nadvertising?--in the strangulation of a postal station and the\nparalysis of Lower Manhattan?--in the mobilization of SBI reserves, the\nde-mothballing of two divisions of G. I. machines and the redeployment\nof the Solar Battle Fleet? Good Lord, boy, why did you do it?\"\n\nRichard Rowe continued to shrink but he squared his shoulders. \"I'm\nsorry, sir, but I just had to. I just had to get in touch with Jane\nDough.\"\n\n\"A girl from another hive? A girl you'd merely gazed at because a guide\nhappened to blow a fuse?\" Krumbine stood up, shaking an angry finger.\n\"Great Scott, boy, where was Your Girl Next Door?\"\n\nRichard Rowe stared bravely at the finger, which made him look a trifle\ncross-eyed. \"She died, sir, both of them.\"\n\n\"But there should be at least six.\"\n\n\"I know, sir, but of the other four, two have been shipped to the\nAdirondacks on vacation and two recently got married and haven't been\nreplaced.\"\n\nPotshelter, a faraway look in his eyes, said softly, \"I think I'm\nbeginning to understand--\"\n\nBut Krumbine thundered on at Richard Rowe with, \"Good Lord, I can see\nyou've had your troubles, boy. It isn't often we have these shortages\nof Girls Next Door, so that temporarily a boy can't marry the Girl Next\nDoor, as he always should. But, Judas Priest, why didn't you take your\ntroubles to your psychiatrist, your groupmaster, your socializer, your\nQueen Mother?\"\n\n\"My psychiatrist is being overhauled, sir, and his replacement\nshort-circuits every time he hears the word 'trouble.' My groupmaster\nand socializer are on vacation duty in the Adirondacks. My Queen Mother\nis busy replacing Girls Next Door.\"\n\n\"Yes, it all fits,\" Potshelter proclaimed excitedly. \"Don't you see,\nKrumbine? Except for a set of mischances that would only occur once in\na billion billion times, the letter would never have been conceived or\nsent.\"\n\n\"You may have something there,\" Krumbine concurred. \"But in any case,\nboy, why did you--er--written this letter to this particular girl? What\nis there about Jane Dough that made you do it?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, sir, she's--\"\n\n\n\nJust then, the door re-dilated and a blue matron machine conducted\na young woman into the office. She was slim and she had a head of\nhair that would have graced a museum beauty, while across the back\nand--well, \"chest\" is an inadequate word--of her paper chemise,\n\"JANE DOUGH\" was silk-screened in the palest pink.\n\nKrumbine did not repeat his last question. He had to admit to himself\nthat it had been answered fully. Potshelter whistled respectfully. The\nblue detective engines gave hard-boiled grunts. Even the blue matron\nmachine seemed awed by the girl's beauty.\n\nBut she had eyes only for Richard Rowe. \"My Grand Central man,\" she\nbreathed in amazement. \"The man I've dreamed of ever since. My man\nwith hair.\" She noticed the way he was looking at her and she breathed\nharder. \"Oh, darling, what have you done?\"\n\n\"I tried to send you a letter.\"\n\n\"A letter? For me? Oh, darling!\"\n\n\n\nKrumbine cleared his throat. \"Potshelter, I'm going to wind this up\nfast. Miss Dough, could you transfer to this young man's hive?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir! Mine has an over-plus of Girls Next Door.\"\n\n\"Good. Mr. Rowe, there's a sky-pilot two levels up--look for the\nusual white collar just below the photocells. Marry this girl and\ntake her home to your hive. If your Queen Mother objects refer her\nto--er--Potshelter here.\"\n\nHe cut short the young people's thanks. \"Just one thing,\" he said,\nwagging a finger at Rowe. \"Don't written any more letters.\"\n\n\"Why ever would I?\" Richard answered. \"Already my action is beginning\nto seem like a mad dream.\"\n\n\"Not to me, dear,\" Jane corrected him. \"Oh, sir, could I have the\nletter he sent me? Not to do anything with. Not to show anyone. Just to\nkeep.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know--\" Krumbine began.\n\n\"Oh, _please_, sir!\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know why not, I was going to say. Here you are, miss.\nJust see that this husband of yours never writtens another.\"\n\nHe turned back as the contracting door shut the young couple from view.\n\n\"You were right, Potshelter,\" he said briskly. \"It was one of those\ncombinations of mischances that come up only once in a billion billion\ntimes. But we're going to have to issue recommendations for new\nprocedures and safeguards that will reduce the possibilities to one\nin a trillion trillion. It will undoubtedly up the Terran income tax\na healthy percentage, but we can't have something like this happening\nagain. Every boy must marry the Girl Next Door! And the first-class\nmails must not be interfered with! The advertising must go through!\"\n\n\"I'd almost like to see it happen again,\" Potshelter murmured dreamily,\n\"if there were another Jane Dough in it.\"\n\n\n\nOutside, Richard and Jane had halted to allow a small cortege of\nmachines to pass. First came a squad of police machines with Black\nSorter in their midst, unmuzzled and docile enough, though still\ngnashing his teeth softly. Then--stretched out horizontally and borne\non the shoulders of Gray Psychiatrist, Black Coroner, White Nursemaid\nSeven and Greasy Joe--there passed the slim form of Pink Wastebasket,\nsnow-white in death. The machines were keening softly, mournfully.\n\nRound about the black pillars, little mecho-mops were scurrying like\nmice, cleaning up the last of the first-class-mail bits of confetti.\n\nRichard winced at this evidence of his aberration, but Jane squeezed\nhis hand comfortingly, which produced in him a truly amazing sensation\nthat changed his whole appearance.\n\n\"I know how you feel, darling,\" she told him. \"But don't worry about\nit. Just think, dear, I'll always be able to tell your friends' wives\nsomething no other woman in the world can boast of: that my husband\nonce wrote me a letter!\"\n\n\n\n\n",
