Jubal Kennedy\nwas of the temperament impervious to spiritual subtleties, fain to reach\nconclusions with the line and rule of mathematical demonstration. Thus,\nall unreceptive, he looked through the mountain gap, as through some\nstupendous gateway, on the splendors of autumn; the vast landscape\nglamorous in a transparent amethystine haze; the foliage of the dense\nprimeval wilderness in the October richness of red and russet; the\n\u201chunter's moon,\u201d a full sphere of illuminated pearl, high in the blue\neast while yet the dull vermilion sun swung westering above the massive\npurple heights. He knew how the sap was sinking; that the growths of the\nyear had now failed; presently all would be shrouded in snow, but only\nto rise again in the reassurance of vernal quickening, to glow anew in\nthe fullness of bloom, to attain eventually the perfection of fruition.\nAnd still he was deaf to the reiterated analogy of death, and blind to\nthe immanent obvious prophecy of resurrection and the life to come. His\nthoughts, as he stood on this jutting crag in Sunrise Gap, were with\na recent \u201cexperience meeting\u201d at which he had sought to canvass his\nspiritual needs. His demand of a sign from the heavens as evidence of\nthe existence of the God of revelation, as assurance of the awakening of\ndivine grace in the human heart, as actual proof that wistful mortality\nis inherently endowed with immortality, had electrified this symposium.\nThough it was fashionable, so to speak, in this remote cove among the\nGreat Smoky Mountains, to be repentant in rhetorical involutions and a\nself-accuser in finespun interpretations of sin, doubt, or more properly\nan eager questioning, a desire to possess the sacred mysteries of\nreligion, was unprecedented. Kennedy was a proud man, reticent,\nreserved. Although the old parson, visibly surprised and startled, had\ngently invited his full confidence, Kennedy had hastily swallowed his\nwords, as best he might, perceiving that the congregation had wholly\nmisinterpreted their true intent and that certain gossips had an unholy\nrelish of the sensation they had caused.\n\nThereafter he indulged his poignant longings for the elucidation of the\nveiled truths only when, as now, he wandered deep in the woods with his\nrifle on his shoulder. He could not have said to-day that he was nearer\nan inspiration, a hope, a \u201cleading,\u201d than heretofore, but as he stood on\nthe crag it was with the effect of a dislocation that he was torn from\nthe solemn theme by an interruption at a vital crisis.\n\nThe faint vibrations of a violin stirred the reverent hush of the\nlandscape in the blended light of the setting sun and the \u201chunter's\nmoon.\u201d Presently the musician came into view, advancing slowly through\nthe aisles of the red autumn forest. A rapt figure it was, swaying in\nresponsive ecstasy with the rhythmic cadence. The head, with its\nlong, blowsy yellow hair, was bowed over the dark polished wood of\nthe instrument; the eyes were half closed; the right arm, despite the\neccentric patches on the sleeve of the old brown-jeans coat, moved with\nfree, elastic gestures in all the liberties of a practiced bowing. If he\nsaw the hunter motionless on the brink of the crag, the fiddler gave\nno intimation. His every faculty was as if enthralled by the swinging\niteration of the sweet melancholy melody, rendered with a breadth of\neffect, an inspiration, it might almost have seemed, incongruous with\nthe infirmities of the crazy old fiddle. He was like a creature under\nthe sway of a spell, and apparently drawn by this dulcet lure of the\nenchantment of sound was the odd procession that trailed silently after\nhim through these deep mountain fastnesses.\n\nA woman came first, arrayed in a ragged purple skirt and a yellow blouse\nopen at the throat, displaying a slender white neck which upheld a face\nof pensive, inert beauty. She clasped in her arms a delicate infant,\nethereal of aspect with its flaxen hair, transparently pallid\ncomplexion, and wide blue eyes. It was absolutely quiescent, save\nthat now and then it turned feebly in its waxen hands a little striped\nred-and-yellow pomegranate. A sturdy blond toddler trudged behind, in a\nchecked blue cotton frock, short enough to disclose cherubic pink feet\nand legs bare to the knee; he carried that treasure of rural juveniles,\na cornstalk violin. An old hound, his tail suavely wagging, padded along\nthe narrow path; and last of all came, with frequent pause to crop the\nwayside herbage, a large cow, brindled red and white.\n\n\u201cThe whole fambly!\u201d muttered Kennedy. Then, aloud, \u201cWhy don't you uns\nkerry the baby, Basil Bedell, an' give yer wife a rest?\u201d\n\nAt the prosaic suggestion the crystal realm of dreams was shattered. The\nbow, with a quavering discordant scrape upon the strings, paused. Then\nBedell slowly mastered the meaning of the interruption.\n\n\u201cKerry the baby! Why, Aurely won't let none but herself tech that baby.\u201d\n He laughed as he tossed the tousled yellow hair from his face, and\nlooked over his shoulder to speak to the infant. \u201cIt air sech a plumb\nspecial delightsome peach, it air,--it air!\u201d\n\nThe pale face of the child lighted up with a smile of recognition and a\nfaint gleam of mirth.\n\n\u201cI jes' kem out ennyhows ter drive up the cow,\u201d Basil added.\n\n\u201cBig job,\u201d sneered Kennedy. \u201c'Pears-like it takes the whole fambly to do\nit.\u201d\n\nSuch slothful mismanagement was calculated to affront an energetic\nspirit. Obviously, at this hour the woman should be at home cooking the\nsupper.\n\n\u201cI follered along ter listen ter the fiddle,--ef ye hev enny call ter\nknow.\u201d Mrs. Bedell replied to his unspoken thought, as if by divination.\n\nBut indeed such strictures were not heard for the first time. They were\nin some sort the penalty of the disinterested friendship which Kennedy\nhad harbored for Basil since their childhood. He wished that his compeer\nmight prosper in such simple wise as his own experience had proved to\nbe amply possible. Kennedy's earlier incentive to industry had been his\nintention to marry, but the object of his affections had found him \u201ctoo\nmortal solemn,\u201d and without a word of warning had married another man in\na distant cove. The element of treachery in this event had gone far to\nreconcile the jilted lover to his future, bereft of her companionship,\nbut the habit of industry thus formed had continued of its own momentum.\nIt had resulted in forehanded thrift; he now possessed a comfortable\nholding,--cattle, house, ample land; and he had all the intolerance\nof the ant for the cricket. As Bedell lifted the bow once more, every\nwincing nerve was enlisted in arresting it in mid-air.\n\n\u201cMighty long tramp fur Bobbie, thar,--why n't ye kerry him!\u201d y\n\nThe imperturbable calm still held fast on the musician's face. \u201cBob,\u201d he\naddressed the toddler, \u201cwill you uns let daddy kerry ye like a baby!\u201d\n\nHe swooped down as if to lift the child, the violin and bow in his left\nhand. The hardy youngster backed off precipitately.\n\n\u201cDon't ye _dare_ ter do it!\u201d he virulently admonished his parent, a\nresentful light in his blue eyes. Then, as Bedell sang a stave in a full\nrich voice, \u201cBye-oh, Baby!\u201d Bob vociferated anew, \u201cDon't you _begin_ ter\ndare do it!\u201d every inch a man though a little one.\n\n\u201cThat's the kind of a fambly I hev got,\u201d Basil commented easily. \u201cWife\nan' boy an' baby all walk over me,--plumb stomp on me! Jes' enough lef\nof me ter play the fiddle a leetle once in a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cMighty nigh all the while, I be afeared,\u201d Kennedy corrected the phrase.\n\u201cHow did yer corn crap turn out!\u201d he asked, as he too fell into line and\nthe procession moved on once more along the narrow path.\n\n\u201cWell enough,\u201d said Basil; \u201cwe uns hev got a sufficiency.\u201d Then, as if\nafraid of seeming boastful he qualified, \u201cYe know I hain't got but\none muel ter feed, an' the cow thar. My sheep gits thar pastur' on\nthe volunteer grass 'mongst the rocks, an' I hev jes' got a few head\nennyhows.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut _why_ hain't ye got more, Basil! Why n't ye work more and quit\nwastin' yer time on that old fool fiddle!\u201d\n\nThe limits of patience were reached. The musician fired up. \u201c'Kase,\u201d\n he retorted, \u201cI make enough. I hev got grace enough ter be thankful fur\nsech ez be vouchsafed ter me. _I_ ain't wantin' no meracle.\u201d\n\nKennedy flushed, following in silence while the musician annotated his\ntriumph by a series of gay little harmonics, and young Hopeful, trudging\nin the rear, executed a soundless fantasia on the cornstalk fiddle with\ngreat brilliancy of technique.\n\n\u201cYou uns air talkin' 'bout whut I said at the meetin' las' month,\u201d\n Kennedy observed at length.\n\n\u201cAn' so be all the mounting,\u201d Aurelia interpolated with a sudden fierce\njoy of reproof.\n\nKennedy winced visibly.\n\n\u201cThe folks all 'low ez ye be no better than an onbeliever.\u201d Aurelia was\nbent on driving the blade home. \u201cThe idee of axin' fur a meracle at this\nlate day,--so ez _ye_ kin be satisfied in yer mind ez ye hev got grace!\nProvidence, though merciful, air _obleeged_, ter know ez sech air plumb\nscandalous an' redic'lous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Aurely, hesh up,\u201d exclaimed her husband, startled from his wonted\nleniency. \u201cI hev never hearn ye talk in sech a key,--yer voice sounds\nplumb out o' tune. I be plumb sorry, Jube, ez I spoke ter you uns 'bout\na meracle at all. But I frar consider'ble nettled by yer words, ye\nsee,--'kase I know I be a powerful, lazy, shif'less cuss----\u201d\n\n\u201cYe know a lie, then,\u201d his helpmate interrupted promptly.\n\n\u201cWhy, Aurely, hesh up,--ye--ye--_woman_, ye!\u201d he concluded injuriously.\nThen resuming his remarks to Kennedy, \u201cI know I _do_ fool away a deal of\nmy time with the fiddle----\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sound of it is like bread ter me,--\n\n\u201cI couldn't live without it,\u201d interposed the unconquered Aurelia.\n\u201cSometimes it minds me o' the singin' o' runnin' water in a lonesome\nplace. Then agin it minds me o' seein' sunshine in a dream. An'\nsometimes it be sweet an' high an' fur off, like a voice from the sky,\ntellin' what no mortial ever knowed before,--an' _then_ it minds me o'\nthe tune them angels sung ter the shepherds abidin' in the fields. I\n_couldn't_ live without it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWoman, hold yer jaw!\u201d Basil proclaimed comprehensively. Then, renewing\nhis explanation to Kennedy, \u201cI kin see that I don't purvide fur my\nfambly ez I ought ter do, through hatin' work and lovin' to play the\nfiddle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain't goin' ter hear my home an' hearth reviled.\u201d Aurelia laid an\nimperative hand on her husband's arm. \u201cYe know ye couldn 't make more\nout'n sech ground,--though I ain't faultin' our land, neither. We uns\nhev enough an' ter spare, all we need an' more than we deserve. We don't\nneed ter ax a meracle from the skies ter stay our souls on faith, nor a\nsign ter prove our grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, _now, stop_, Aurely!--I declar', Jube I dunno what made me lay my\ntongue ter sech a word ez that thar miser'ble benighted meracle! I be\npowerful sorry I hurt yer feelin's, Jube; folks seekin' salvation git\nmightily mis-put sometimes, an'----\u201d\n\n\u201c_I_ don't want ter hear none o' yer views on religion,\u201d Kennedy\ninterrupted gruffly. An apology often augments the sense of injury. In\nthis instance it also annulled the provocation, for his own admission\nput Bedell hopelessly in the wrong. \u201cEz a friend I war argufyin' with ye\nagin' yer waste o' time with that old fool fiddle. Ye hev got wife an'\nchildren, an' yit not so well off in this world's gear ez me, a single\nman. I misdoubts ef ye hev hunted a day since the craps war laid by, or\nhev got a pound o' jerked venison stored up fer winter. But this air\nyer home,\u201d--he pointed upward at a little clearing beginning, as they\napproached, to be visible amidst the forest,--\u201can' ef ye air satisfied\nwith sech ez it be, that comes from laziness stiddier a contented\nsperit.\u201d\n\nWith this caustic saying he suddenly left them, the procession standing\nsilently staring after him as he took his way through the woods in the\ndusky red shadows of the autumnal gloaming.\n\nAurelia's vaunted home was indeed a poor place,--not even the rude\nthough substantial log-cabin common to the region. It was a flimsy\nshanty of boards, and except for its rickety porch was more like a box\nthan a house. It had its perch on a jutting eminence, where it seemed\nthe familiar of the skies, so did the clouds and winds circle about it.\nThrough the great gateway of Sunrise Gap it commanded a landscape of a\nscope that might typify a world, in its multitude of mountain ranges, in\nthe intricacies of its intervening valleys, in the glittering coils\nof its water-courses. Basil would sometimes sink into deep silences,\noverpowered by the majesty of nature in this place. After a long hiatus\nthe bow would tremble and falter on the strings as if overawed for a\ntime; presently the theme would strengthen, expand, resound with large\nmeaning, and then he would send forth melodies that he had never before\nplayed or heard, his own dream, the reflection of that mighty mood of\nnature in the limpid pool of his receptive mind.\n\nAround were rocks, crags, chasms,--the fields which nourished the family\nlay well from the verge, within the purlieus of the limited mountain\nplateau. He had sought to persuade himself that it was to save all the\narable land for tillage that he had placed his house and door-yard here,\nbut both he and Aurelia were secretly aware of the subterfuge; he would\nfain be always within the glamour of the prospect through Sunrise Gap!\n\nTheir interlocutor had truly deemed that the woman should have been\nearlier at home cooking the supper. Dusk had deepened to darkness long\nbefore the meal smoked upon the board. The spinning-wheel had begun to\nwhir for her evening stint when other hill-folks had betaken themselves\nto bed. Basil puffed his pipe before the fire; the flicker and\nflare pervaded every nook of the bright little house. Strings of\nred-pepper-pods flaunted in festoons from the beams; the baby slumbered\nunder a gay quilt in his rude cradle, never far from his mother's hand,\nbut the bluff little boy was still up and about, although his aspect,\nround and burly, in a scanty nightgown, gave token of recognition of the\nfact that bed was his appropriate place. His shrill plaintive voice rose\never and anon wakefully.\n\n\u201cI wanter hear a bear tale,--I wanter hear a bear tale.\u201d\n\nThus Basil must needs knock the ashes from his pipe the better to devote\nhimself to the narration,--a prince of raconteurs, to judge by the\nspell-bound interest of the youngster who stood at his knee and hung\non his words. Even Aurelia checked the whir of her wheel to listen\nsmilingly. She broke out laughing in appreciative pleasure when Basil\ntook up the violin to show how a jovial old bear, who intruded into this\nvery house one day when all the family were away at the church in the\ncove, and who mistook the instrument for a banjo, addressed himself to\npicking out this tune, singing the while a quaint and ursine lay. Basil\nembellished the imitation with a masterly effect of realistic growls.\n\n\u201cEf ye keep goin' at that gait, Basil,\u201d Aurelia admonished him,\n\u201cdaylight will ketch us all wide awake around the fire,--no wonder the\nchild won't go to bed.\u201d She seemed suddenly impressed with the pervasive\ncheer. \u201cWhat a fool that man, Jube Kennedy, must be! How _could_\nennybody hev a sweeter, darlinger home than we uns hev got hyar in\nSunrise Gap!\u201d\n\nOn the languorous autumn a fierce winter ensued. The cold came early.\nThe deciduous growths of the forests were leafless ere November waned,\nrifled by the riotous marauding winds. December set in with the gusty\nsnow flying fast. Drear were the gray skies; ghastly the sheeted ranges.\nDrifts piled high in bleak ravines, and the grim gneissoid crags were\nbegirt with gigantic icicles. But about the little house in Sunrise\nGap that kept so warm a heart, the holly trees showed their glad green\nleaves and the red berries glowed with a mystic significance.\n\nAs the weeks wore on, the place was often in Kennedy's mind, although\nhe had not seen it since that autumn afternoon when he had bestirred\nhimself to rebuke its owner concerning the inadequacies of the domestic\nprovision. His admonition had been kindly meant and had not deserved\nthe retort, the flippant ridicule of his spiritual yearnings. Though he\nstill winced from the recollection, he was sorry that he had resisted\nthe importunacy of Basil's apology. He realized that Aurelia had\npersisted to the limit of her power in the embitterment of the\ncontroversy, but even Aurelia he was disposed to forgive as time passed\non. When Christinas Day dawned, the vague sentiment began to assume the\ndefiniteness of a purpose, and noontide found him on his way to Sunrise\nGap.\n\nThere was now no path through the woods; the snow lay deep over all,\nunbroken save at long intervals when queer footprints gave token of the\nstirring abroad of the sylvan denizens, and he felt an idle interest in\ndistinguishing the steps of wolf and fox, of opossum and weasel. In the\nintricacies of the forest aisles, amid laden boughs of pine and fir,\nthere was a suggestion of darkness, but all the sky held not enough\nlight to cast the shadow of a bole on the white blank spaces of the\nsnow-covered ground. A vague blue haze clothed the air; yet as he drew\nnear the mountain brink, all was distinct in the vast landscape, the\nmassive ranges and alternating valleys in infinite repetition.\n\nHe wondered when near the house that he had not heard the familiar\nbarking of the old hound; then he remembered that the sound of his\nhorse's hoofs was muffled by the snow. He was glad to be unheralded.\nHe would like to surprise Aurelia into geniality before her vicarious\nrancor for Basil's sake should be roused anew. As he emerged from\nthe thick growths of the holly, with the icy scintillations of its\nclustering green leaves and red berries, he drew rein so suddenly that\nthe horse was thrown back on his haunches. The rider sat as if petrified\nin the presence of an awful disaster.\n\nThe house was gone! Even the site had vanished! Kennedy stared\nbewildered. Slowly the realization of what had chanced here began to\ncreep through his brain. Evidently there had been a gigantic landslide.\nThe cliff-like projection was broken sheer off,--hurled into the depths\nof the valley. Some action of subterranean waters, throughout ages,\ndoubtless, had been undermining the great crags till the rocky crust\nof the earth had collapsed. He could see even now how the freeze had\nfractured outcropping ledges where the ice had gathered in the fissures.\nA deep abyss that he remembered as being at a considerable distance\nfrom the mountain's brink, once spanned by a foot-bridge, now showed\nthe remnant of its jagged, shattered walls at the extreme verge of the\nprecipice.\n\nA cold chill of horror benumbed his senses. Basil, the wife, the\nchildren,--where were they? A terrible death, surely, to be torn from\nthe warm securities of the hearth-stone, without a moment's warning,\nand hurled into the midst of this frantic turmoil of nature, down to\nthe depths of the gap,--a thousand feet below! And at what time had this\ndread fate befallen his friend? He remembered that at the cross-roads'\nstore, when he had paused on his way to warm himself that morning, some\ngossip was detailing the phenomenon of unseasonable thunder during the\nprevious night, while others protested that it must have been only\nthe clamors of \u201cChristmas guns\u201d firing all along the country-side. \u201cA\nturrible clap, it was,\u201d the raconteur had persisted. \u201cSounded ez ef all\ncreation hed split apart.\u201d Perhaps, therefore, the catastrophe might be\nrecent. Kennedy could scarcely command his muscles as he dismounted and\nmade his way slowly and cautiously to the verge.\n\nAny deviation from the accustomed routine of nature has an unnerving\neffect, unparalleled by disaster in other sort; no individual danger or\ndoom, the aspect of death by drowning, or gunshot, or disease, can so\nabash the reason and stultify normal expectation. Kennedy was scarcely\nconscious that he saw the vast disorder of the landslide, scattered from\nthe precipice on the mountain's brink to the depths of the Gap--inverted\nroots of great pines thrust out in mid-air, foundations of crags riven\nasunder and hurled in monstrous fragments along the steep slant, unknown\nstreams newly liberated from the caverns of the range and cascading from\nthe crevices of the rocks. In effect he could not believe his own eyes.\nHis mind realized the perception of his senses only when his heart\nsuddenly plunged with a wild hope,--he had discerned amongst the turmoil\na shape of line and rule, the little box-like hut! Caught as it was in\nthe boughs of a cluster of pines and firs, uprooted and thrust out at an\nincline a little less than vertical, the inmates might have been spared\nsuch shock of the fall as would otherwise have proved fatal. Had the\nhouse been one of the substantial log-cabins of the region its timbers\nmust have been torn one from another, the daubing and chinking scattered\nas mere atoms. But the more flimsy character of the little dwelling\nhad thus far served to save it,--the interdependent \u201cframing\u201d of its\nstructure held fast; the upright studding and boards, nailed stoutly on,\nrendered it indeed the box that it looked. It was, so to speak, built in\none piece, and no part was subjected to greater strain than another.\nBut should the earth cave anew, should the tough fibres of one of those\ngigantic roots tear out from the loosened friable soil, should the\nelastic supporting branches barely sway in some errant gust of wind, the\nlittle box would fall hundreds of feet, cracked like a nut, shattering\nagainst the rocks of the levels below.\n\nHe wondered if the inmates yet lived,--he pitied them still more if\nthey only existed to realize their peril, to await in an anguish of\nfear their ultimate doom. Perhaps--he felt he was but trifling with\ndespair--some rescue might be devised.\n\nSuch a weird cry he set up on the brink of the mountain!--full of\nhorror, grief, and that poignant hope. The echoes of the Gap seemed\nreluctant to repeat the tones, dull, slow, muffled in snow. But a sturdy\nhalloo responded from the window, uppermost now, for the house lay\non its side amongst the boughs. Kennedy thought he saw the pallid\nsimulacrum of a face.\n\n\u201cThis be Jube Kennedy,\u201d he cried, reassuringly. \u201cI be goin' ter fetch\nhelp,--men, ropes, and a windlass.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake haste then,--we uns be nigh friz.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe air in no danger of fire, then?\u201d asked the practical man.\n\n\u201cWe hev hed none,--before we war flunged off'n the bluff we hed\nsquinched the fire ter pledjure Bob, ez he war afeard Santy Claus would\nscorch his feet comm' down the chimbley,--powerful lucky fur we uns; the\nfire would hev burnt the house bodaciously.\u201d\n\nKennedy hardly stayed to hear. He was off in a moment, galloping at\nfrantic speed along the snowy trail scarcely traceable in the sad light\nof the gray day; taking short cuts through the densities of the laurel;\ntorn by jagged rocks and tangles of thorny growths and broken branches\nof great trees; plunging now and again into deep drifts above concealed\nicy chasms, and rescuing with inexpressible difficulty the floundering,\nstruggling horse; reaching again the open sheeted roadway, bruised,\nbleeding, exhausted, yet furiously plunging forward, rousing the\nsparsely settled country-side with imperative insistence for help in\nthis matter of life or death!\n\nDeath, indeed, only,--for the enterprise was pronounced impossible by\nthose more experienced than Kennedy. Among the men now on the bluff were\nseveral who had been employed in the silver mines of this region, and\nthey demonstrated conclusively that a rope could not be worked clear of\nthe obstructions of the face of the rugged and shattered cliffs; that\na human being, drawn from the cabin, strapped in a chair, must needs be\ntorn from it and flung into the abyss below, or beaten to a frightful\ndeath against the jagged rocks in the transit.\n\n\u201cBut not ef the chair war ter be steadied by a guy-rope from--say--from\nthat thar old pine tree over thar,\u201d Kennedy insisted, indicating the\nlong bole of a partially uprooted and inverted tree on the steeps. \u201cThe\nchair would swing cl'ar of the bluff then.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Jube, it is onpossible ter git a guy-rope over ter that\ntree,--more than a man's life is wuth ter try it.\u201d\n\nA moment ensued of absolute silence,--space, however, for a hard-fought\nbattle.\n\nThe aspect of that mad world below, with every condition of creation\nreversed; a mistake in the adjustment of the winch and gear by the\nexcited, reluctant, disapproving men; an overstrain on the fibres of the\nlong-used rope; a slip on the treacherous ice; the dizzy whirl of the\nsenses that even a glance downward at those drear depths set astir in\nthe brain,--all were canvassed within his mental processes, all were\nduly realized in their entirety ere he said with a spare dull voice and\ndry lips,--\n\n\u201cFix ter let me down ter that thar leanin' pine, boys,--I'll kerry a\nguy-rope over thar.\u201d\n\nAt one side the crag beetled, and although it was impossible thence to\nreach the cabin with a rope it would swing clear of obstructions here,\nand might bring the rescuer within touch of the pine, where could be\nfastened the guy-rope; the other end would be affixed to the chair which\ncould be lowered to the cabin only from the rugged face of the cliff.\nKennedy harbored no self-deception; he more than doubted the outcome of\nthe enterprise. He quaked and turned pale with dread as with the great\nrope knotted about his arm-pits and around his waist he was swung over\nthe brink at the point where the crag jutted forth,--lower and lower\nstill; now nearing the slanting inverted pine, caught amidst the d\u00e9bris\nof earth and rock; now failing to reach its boughs; once more swinging\nback to a great distance, so did the length of the rope increase the\nscope of the pendulum; now nearing the pine again, and at last fairly\nlodged on the icy bole, knotting and coiling about it the end of the\nguy-rope, on which he had come and on which he must needs return.\n\nIt seemed, through the inexpert handling of the little group, a long\ntime before the stout arm-chair was secured to the cables, slowly\nlowered, and landed at last on the outside of the hut. Many an anxious\nglance was cast at the slate-gray sky. An inopportune flurry of snow, a\nflaw of wind:--and even now all would be lost. Dusk too impended, and\nas the rope began to coil on the windlass at the signal to hoist every\neye was strained to discern the identity of the first voyagers in this\naerial journey,--the two children, securely lashed to the chair. This\nwas well,--all felt that both parents might best wait, might risk\nthe added delay. The chair came swinging easily, swiftly, along the\ngradations of the rise, the guy-rope holding it well from the chances\nof contact with the jagged projections of the face of the cliff, and the\nfirst shout of triumph rang sonorously from the summit.\n\nWhen next the chair rested on the cabin beside the window, a thrill of\nanxiety and anger went through Kennedy's heart to note, from his perch\non the leaning pine, a struggle between husband and wife as to who\nshould go first. Each was eager to take the many risks incident to the\nlong wait in this precarious lodgment. The man was the stronger. Aurelia\nwas forced into the chair, tied fast, pushed off, waving' her hand to\nher husband, shedding floods of tears, looking at him for the last time,\nas she fancied, and calling out dismally, \u201cFar'well, Basil, far'-well.\u201d\n\nEven this lugubrious demonstration could not damp the spirits of the men\nworking like mad at the windlass. They were jovial enough for bursts\nof laughter when it became apparent that Basil had utilized the ensuing\ninterval to tie together, in preparation for the ascent with himself,\nthe two objects which he next most treasured, his violin and his old\nhound. The trusty chair bore all aloft, and Basil was received with\nwelcoming acclamations.\n\nBefore the rope was wound anew and for the last time, the aspect of\nthe group on the cliff had changed. It had grown eerie, indistinct. The\npines and firs showed no longer their sempervirent green, but were black\namid the white tufted lines on their branches, that still served to\naccentuate their symmetry. The vale had disappeared in a sinister abyss\nof gloom, though Kennedy would not look down at its menace, but upward,\nalways upward. Thus he saw, like some radiant and splendid star, the\nfirst torch whitely aglow on the brink of the precipice. It opened long\navenues of light adown the snowy landscape,--soft blue shadows trailed\nafter it, like half-descried draperies of elusive hovering beings. Soon\nthe torch was duplicated; another and then another began to glow. Now\nseveral drew together, and like a constellation glimmered crownlike\non the brow of the night, as he felt the rope stir with the signal to\nhoist.\n\nUpward, always upward, his eyes on that radiant stellular coronal, as\nit shone white and splendid in the snowy night. And now it had lost its\nmystic glamour,--disintegrated by gradual approach he could see the long\nhandles of the pine-knots; the red verges of the flame; the blue and\nyellow tones of the focus; the trailing wreaths of dun-tinted smoke that\nrose from them. Then became visible the faces of the men who held them,\nall crowding eagerly to the verge. But it was in a solemn silence\nthat he was received; a drear cold darkness, every torch being stuick\ndownward into the snow; a frantic haste in unharnessing him from the\nropes, for he was almost frozen. He was hardly apt enough to interpret\nthis as an emotion too deep for words, but now and again, as he was\ndisentangled, he felt about his shoulders a furtive hug, and more than\none pair of the ministering hands must needs pause to wring his own\nhands hard. They practically carried him to a fire that had been built\nin a sheltered place in one of those grottoes of the region, locally\ncalled \u201cRock-houses.\u201d Its cavernous portal gave upon a dark interior,\nand not until they had turned a corner in a tunnel-like passage was\nrevealed an arched space in a rayonnant suffusion of light, the fire\nitself obscured by the figures about it. His eyes were caught first by\nthe aspect of a youthful mother with a golden-haired babe on her breast;\nclose by showed the head and horns of a cow; the mule was mercifully\nsheltered too, and stood near, munching his fodder; a cluster of\nsheep pressed after the steps of half a dozen men, that somehow in the\nclare-obscure reminded him of the shepherds of old summoned by good\ntidings of great joy.\n\nA sudden figure started up with streaming white hair and patriarchal\nbeard.\n\n\u201cWill ye deny ez ye hev hed a sign from the heavens, Jubal Kennedy?\u201d the\nold circuit-rider straitly demanded. \u201cHow could ye hev strengthened yer\nheart fur sech a deed onless the grace o' God prevailed mightily\nwithin ye? Inasmuch as ye hev done it unto one o' the least o' these my\nbrethern, ye hev done it unto me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ain't the _kind_ o' sign, parson,\u201d Kennedy faltered. \u201cI be lookin'\nfur a meracle in the yearth or in the air, that I kin view or hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kingdom o' Christ is a spiritual kingdom,\u201d said the parson\nsolemnly. \u201cThe kingdom o' Christ is a _spiritual_ kingdom, an' great are\nthe wonders that are wrought therein.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n",
