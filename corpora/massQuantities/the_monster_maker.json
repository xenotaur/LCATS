    "body": "Suddenly, it was there. There wasn't time to blink or speak or get\nscared. Click Hathaway's camera was loaded and he stood there listening\nto it rack-spin film between his fingers, and he knew he was getting a\ndamned sweet picture of everything that was happening.\n\nThe picture of Marnagan hunched huge over the control-console,\nwrenching levers, jamming studs with freckled fists. And out in the\ndark of the fore-part there was space and a star-sprinkling and this\nmeteor coming like blazing fury.\n\nClick Hathaway felt the ship move under him like a sensitive animal's\nskin. And then the meteor hit. It made a spiked fist and knocked the\nrear-jets flat, and the ship spun like a cosmic merry-go-round.\n\nThere was plenty of noise. Too damned much. Hathaway only knew he was\npicked up and hurled against a lever-bank, and that Marnagan wasn't\nlong in following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging on to\nhis camera and gritting to keep holding it. What a sweet shot that had\nbeen of the meteor! A sweeter one still of Marnagan beating hell out of\nthe controls and keeping his words to himself until just now.\n\nIt got quiet. It got so quiet you could almost hear the asteroids\nrushing up, cold, blue and hard. You could hear your heart kicking a\ntom-tom between your sick stomach and your empty lungs.\n\nStars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan because he was the\nnearest thing, and held on. You came hunting for a space-raider and you\nended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk of\nmetal death. What a fade-out!\n\n\"Irish!\" he heard himself say. \"Is this IT?\"\n\n\"Is this _what_?\" yelled Marnagan inside his helmet.\n\n\"Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?\"\n\nMarnagan fumed. \"I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'm\nready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!\"\n\nThey both waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand of\ngravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.\n\nThe ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end over\nand stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattled\naround--human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst,\nair and energy flung out.\n\nHathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinking\nquick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reach\nfilm, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like _this_ one! His\nbrain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of his\ncamera.\n\n\n\nSilence came and engulfed all the noise, ate it up and swallowed it.\nHathaway shook his head, instinctively grabbed at the camera locked\nto his mid-belt. There was nothing but stars, twisted wreckage, cold\nthat pierced through his vac-suit, and silence. He wriggled out of the\nwreckage into that silence.\n\nHe didn't know what he was doing until he found the camera in his\nfingers as if it had grown there when he was born. He stood there,\nthinking \"Well, I'll at least have a few good scenes on film. I'll--\"\n\nA hunk of metal teetered, fell with a crash. Marnagan elevated seven\nfeet of bellowing manhood from the wreck.\n\n\"Hold it!\" cracked Hathaway's high voice. Marnagan froze. The camera\nwhirred. \"Low angle shot; Interplanetary Patrolman emerges unscathed\nfrom asteroid crackup. Swell stuff. I'll get a raise for this!\"\n\n\"From the toe of me boot!\" snarled Marnagan brusquely. Oxen shoulders\nflexed inside his vac-suit. \"I might've died in there, and you nursin'\nthat film-contraption!\"\n\nHathaway felt funny inside, suddenly. \"I never thought of that.\nMarnagan die? I just took it for granted you'd come through. You always\nhave. Funny, but you don't think about dying. You try not to.\" Hathaway\nstared at his gloved hand, but the gloving was so thick and heavy he\ncouldn't tell if it was shaking. Muscles in his bony face went down,\npale. \"Where are we?\"\n\n\"A million miles from nobody.\"\n\nThey stood in the middle of a pocked, time-eroded meteor plain that\nstretched off, dipping down into silent indigo and a rash of stars.\nOverhead, the sun poised; black and stars all around it, making it look\nsick.\n\n\"If we walk in opposite directions, Click Hathaway, we'd be shaking\nhands the other side of this rock in two hours.\" Marnagan shook his mop\nof dusty red hair. \"And I promised the boys at Luna Base this time I'd\ncapture that Gunther lad!\"\n\nHis voice stopped and the silence spoke.\n\nHathaway felt his heart pumping slow, hot pumps of blood. \"I checked\nmy oxygen, Irish. Sixty minutes of breathing left.\"\n\nThe silence punctuated that sentence, too. Upon the sharp meteoric\nrocks Hathaway saw the tangled insides of the radio, the food supply\nmashed and scattered. They were lucky to have escaped. Or _was_\nsuffocation a better death...? _Sixty minutes._\n\nThey stood and looked at one another.\n\n\"Damn that meteor!\" said Marnagan, hotly.\n\nHathaway got hold of an idea; remembering something. He said it out:\n\"Somebody tossed that meteor, Irish. I took a picture of it, looked\nit right in the eye when it rolled at us, and it was poker-hot.\nSpace-meteors are never hot and glowing. If it's proof you want, I've\ngot it here, on film.\"\n\nMarnagan winced his freckled square of face. \"It's not proof we need\nnow, Click. Oxygen. And then _food_. And then some way back to Earth.\"\n\nHathaway went on saying his thoughts: \"This is Gunther's work. He's\nhere somewhere, probably laughing his guts out at the job he did us.\nOh, God, this would make great news-release stuff if we ever get back\nto Earth. I.P.'s Irish Marnagan, temporarily indisposed by a pirate\nwhose dirty face has never been seen, Gunther by name, finally wins\nthrough to a triumphant finish. Photographed on the spot, in color, by\nyours truly, Click Hathaway. Cosmic Films, please notice.\"\n\n\n\nThey started walking, fast, over the pocked, rubbled plain toward a\nbony ridge of metal. They kept their eyes wide and awake. There wasn't\nmuch to see, but it was better than standing still, waiting.\n\nMarnagan said, \"We're working on margin, and we got nothin' to sweat\nwith except your suspicions about this not being an accident. We got\nfifty minutes to prove you're right. After that--right or wrong--you'll\nbe Cosmic Films prettiest unmoving, unbreathin' genius. But talk all\nyou like, Click. It's times like this when we all need words, any\nwords, on our tongues. You got your camera and your scoop. Talk about\nit. As for me--\" he twisted his glossy red face. \"Keeping alive is me\nhobby. And this sort of two-bit death I did not order.\"\n\nClick nodded. \"Gunther knows how you'd hate dying this way, Irish.\nIt's irony clean through. That's probably why he planned the meteor and\nthe crash this way.\"\n\nMarnagan said nothing, but his thick lips went down at the corners, far\ndown, and the green eyes blazed.\n\nThey stopped, together.\n\n\"Oops!\" Click said.\n\n\"Hey!\" Marnagan blinked. \"Did you feel _that_?\"\n\nHathaway's body felt feathery, light as a whisper, boneless and\nlimbless, suddenly. \"Irish! We lost weight, coming over that ridge!\"\n\nThey ran back. \"Let's try it again.\"\n\nThey tried it. They scowled at each other. The same thing happened.\n\"Gravity should not act this way, Click.\"\n\n\"Are you telling me? It's man-made. Better than that--it's Gunther! No\nwonder we fell so fast--we were dragged down by a super-gravity set-up!\nGunther'd do anything to--did I say _anything_?\"\n\nHathaway leaped backward in reaction. His eyes widened and his hand\ncame up, jabbing. Over a hill-ridge swarmed a brew of unbelievable\nhorrors. Progeny from Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts with\nnumerous legs and gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, some\ntubular and fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along\nin the air. Fangs caught starlight white on them.\n\nHathaway yelled and ran, Marnagan at his heels, lumbering. Sweat broke\ncold on his body. The immense things rolled, slithered and squirmed\nafter him. A blast of light. Marnagan, firing his proton-gun. Then, in\nClick's ears, the Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun didn't hurt\nthe creatures at all.\n\n\"Irish!\" Hathaway flung himself over the ridge, slid down an incline\ntoward the mouth a small cave. \"This way, fella!\"\n\nHathaway made it first, Marnagan bellowing just behind him. \"They're\ntoo big; they can't get us in here!\" Click's voice gasped it out,\nas Marnagan squeezed his two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him.\nInstinctively, Hathaway added, \"Asteroid monsters! My camera! What a\nscene!\"\n\n\"Damn your damn camera!\" yelled Marnagan. \"They might come in!\"\n\n\"Use your gun.\"\n\n\"They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And that was a pretty chase,\neh, Click?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Sure. _You_ enjoyed it, every moment of it.\"\n\n\"I did that.\" Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. \"Now, what\nwill we be doing with these uninvited guests at our door?\"\n\n\"Let me think--\"\n\n\"Lots of time, little man. Forty more minutes of air, to be exact.\"\n\n\n\nThey sat, staring at the monsters for about a minute. Hathaway felt\nfunny about something; didn't know what. Something about these monsters\nand Gunther and--\n\n\"Which one will you be having?\" asked Irish, casually. \"A red one or a\nblue one?\"\n\nHathaway laughed nervously. \"A pink one with yellow ruffles--Good God,\nnow you've got _me_ doing it. Joking in the face of death.\"\n\n\"Me father taught me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck.\"\n\nThat didn't please the photographer. \"I'm an Anglo-Swede,\" he pointed\nout.\n\nMarnagan shifted uneasily. \"Here, now. You're doing nothing but\nsitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so take\nme a profile shot of the beasties and myself.\"\n\nHathaway petted his camera reluctantly. \"What in hell's the use? All\nthis swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" retorted Marnagan, \"we'll develop it for our own benefit; while\nwaitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our\nrescue!\"\n\nHathaway snorted. \"U.S. Cavalry.\"\n\nMarnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. \"Snap me this pose,\" he\nsaid. \"I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,\nmy capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace\nnegotiations betwixt me and these pixies.\"\n\nMarnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver\nfor nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running\naround in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but\nhis mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of\nMarnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.\n\nMontage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling\nfor the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without\nmuch effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death\nwall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying\nanything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they\nhad sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.\n\nWhen Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it\nup arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:\n\n\"Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt\nback on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,\nwhat's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space\nwar isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory\nis lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which\ndispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?\nSuper-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.\nIt's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes\nunseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces.\"\n\nMarnagan rumbled. \"Where _is_ the dirty son, then!\"\n\n\"He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent--them.\" Hathaway nodded at\nthe beasts. \"People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from\nwounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that--the animals\ntend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtle\nhis attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if the\nPatrol happens to land and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,\nthen.\"\n\n\"I don't see no Base around.\"\n\n\n\nClick shrugged. \"Still doubt it? Okay. Look.\" He tapped his camera and\na spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he stripped\nit out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it\ndeveloped, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing\nfilm. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,\nleaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the\nimpressions. Quick stuff.\n\nInserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,\nClick handed the whole thing over. \"Look.\"\n\nMarnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. \"Ah,\nClick. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid\nmonsters complete.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\nHathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:\nPictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally\nwith _nothing_; Marnagan shooting his gun at _nothing_; Marnagan\npretending to be happy in front of _nothing_.\n\nThen, closeup--of--NOTHING!\n\nThe monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair\nlike a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.\nMaybe--\n\nHathaway said it, loud: \"Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this\nmess! Here--\"\n\nHe elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,\nthe beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the\nmonsters weren't there, they weren't there.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Marnagan. \"But step outside this cave--\"\n\n\"If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid,\" said Click.\n\nMarnagan scowled. \"You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or\ninfra-red or something that won't come out on film?\"\n\n\"Nuts! Any color _we_ see, the camera sees. We've been fooled.\"\n\n\"Hey, where _you_ going?\" Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller man\ntried pushing past him.\n\n\"Get out of the way,\" said Hathaway.\n\nMarnagan put his big fists on his hips. \"If anyone is going anywhere,\nit'll be me does the going.\"\n\n\"I can't let you do that, Irish.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You'd be going on my say-so.\"\n\n\"Ain't your say-so good enough for me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess--\"\n\n\"If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, stand\naside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle their\nbones.\" He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't exist\nexcept under an inch of porous metal plate. \"Your express purpose on\nthis voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol later\nfor teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-hand\neducation. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give me\nprofile a scan. This is lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into The\nLion's Den.\"\n\n\"Irish, I--\"\n\n\"Shut up and load up.\"\n\nHathaway nervously loaded the film-slot, raised it.\n\n\"Ready, Click?\"\n\n\"I--I guess so,\" said Hathaway. \"And remember, think it hard, Irish.\nThink it hard. There aren't any animals--\"\n\n\"Keep me in focus, lad.\"\n\n\"All the way, Irish.\"\n\n\"What do they say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!\"\n\nMarnagan held his gun out in front of him and still smiling took one,\ntwo, three, four steps out into the outside world. The monsters were\nwaiting for him at the fifth step. Marnagan kept walking.\n\nRight out into the middle of them....\n\n\n\nThat was the sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan and the\nmonsters!\n\nOnly now it was only Marnagan.\n\nNo more monsters.\n\nMarnagan smiled a smile broader than his shoulders. \"Hey, Click, look\nat me! I'm in one piece. Why, hell, the damned things turned tail and\nran away!\"\n\n\"Ran, hell!\" cried Hathaway, rushing out, his face flushed and\nanimated. \"They just plain vanished. They were only imaginative\nfigments!\"\n\n\"And to think we let them hole us in that way, Click Hathaway, you\ncoward!\"\n\n\"Smile when you say that, Irish.\"\n\n\"Sure, and ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, are them tears in\nyour sweet grey eyes?\"\n\n\"Damn,\" swore the photographer, embarrassedly. \"Why don't they put\nwindow-wipers in these helmets?\"\n\n\"I'll take it up with the Board, lad.\"\n\n\"Forget it. I was so blamed glad to see your homely carcass in one\nhunk, I couldn't help--Look, now, about Gunther. Those animals are part\nof his set-up. Explorers who land here inadvertently, are chased back\ninto their ships, forced to take off. Tourists and the like. Nothing\nsuspicious about animals. And if the tourists don't leave, the animals\nkill them.\"\n\n\"Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill.\"\n\n\"Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long as we believed in them they could\nhave frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. If\nthat isn't being dangerous--\"\n\nThe Irishman whistled.\n\n\"But, we've got to _move_, Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen.\nIn that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source,\nGunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters.\" Click\nattached his camera to his mid-belt. \"Gunther probably thinks we're\ndead by now. Everyone else's been fooled by his playmates; they never\nhad a chance to disbelieve them.\"\n\n\"If it hadn't been for you taking them pictures, Click--\"\n\n\"Coupled with your damned stubborn attitude about the accident--\" Click\nstopped and felt his insides turning to water. He shook his head and\nfelt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steady\nhimself, and swayed. \"I--I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours.\nThis excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick.\"\n\nMarnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. \"Hold tight, Click. The\nguy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach.\"\n\n\"Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animals\ncame from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to come\nback!\"\n\n\"Come back? How?\"\n\n\"They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if we\nbelieve in them again, they'll return.\"\n\nMarnagan didn't like it. \"Won't--won't they kill us--if they come--if\nwe believe in 'em?\"\n\nHathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. \"Not if we believe\nin them to a _certain point_. Psychologically they can both be seen and\nfelt. We only want to _see_ them coming at us again.\"\n\n\"_Do_ we, now?\"\n\n\"With twenty minutes left, maybe less--\"\n\n\"All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How do we do it?\"\n\nHathaway fought against the mist in his eyes. \"Just think--I will see\nthe monsters again. I will see them again and I will not feel them.\nThink it over and over.\"\n\nMarnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. \"And--what if I forget to remember\nall that? What if I get excited...?\"\n\nHathaway didn't answer. But his eyes told the story by just looking at\nIrish.\n\nMarnagan cursed. \"All right, lad. Let's have at it!\"\n\nThe monsters returned.\n\n\n\nA soundless deluge of them, pouring over the rubbled horizon, swarming\nin malevolent anticipation about the two men.\n\n\"This way, Irish. They come from this way! There's a focal point, a\nsending station for these telepathic brutes. Come on!\"\n\nHathaway sludged into the pressing tide of color, mouths, contorted\nfaces, silvery fat bodies misting as he plowed through them.\n\nMarnagan was making good progress ahead of Hathaway. But he stopped and\nraised his gun and made quick moves with it. \"Click! This one here!\nIt's real!\" He fell back and something struck him down. His immense\nframe slammed against rock, noiselessly.\n\nHathaway darted forward, flung his body over Marnagan's, covered the\nhelmet glass with his hands, shouting:\n\n\"Marnagan! Get a grip, dammit! It's not real--don't let it force into\nyour mind! It's not real, I tell you!\"\n\n\"Click--\" Marnagan's face was a bitter, tortured movement behind glass.\n\"Click--\" He was fighting hard. \"I--I--sure now. Sure--\" He smiled.\n\"It--it's only a shanty fake!\"\n\n\"Keep saying it, Irish. Keep it up.\"\n\nMarnagan's thick lips opened. \"It's only a fake,\" he said. And then,\nirritated, \"Get the hell off me, Hathaway. Let me up to my feet!\"\n\nHathaway got up, shakily. The air in his helmet smelled stale, and\nlittle bubbles danced in his eyes. \"Irish, _you_ forget the monsters.\nLet me handle them, I know how. They might fool you again, you might\nforget.\"\n\nMarnagan showed his teeth. \"Gah! Let a flea have all the fun? And\nbesides, Click, I like to look at them. They're pretty.\"\n\nThe outpour of animals came from a low lying mound a mile farther on.\nEvidently the telepathic source lay there. They approached it warily.\n\n\"We'll be taking our chances on guard,\" hissed Irish. \"I'll go ahead,\ndraw their attention, maybe get captured. Then, _you_ show up with\n_your_ gun....\"\n\n\"I haven't got one.\"\n\n\"We'll chance it, then. You stick here until I see what's ahead. They\nprobably got scanners out. Let them see me--\"\n\nAnd before Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked about\nfive hundred yards, bent down, applied his fingers to something, heaved\nup, and there was a door opening in the rock.\n\nHis voice came back across the distance, into Click's earphones. \"A\ndoor, an air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading down inside!\"\n\nThen, Marnagan dropped into the tunnel, disappearing. Click heard the\nthud of his feet hitting the metal flooring.\n\nClick sucked in his breath, hard and fast.\n\n\"All right, put 'em up!\" a new harsh voice cried over a different\nradio. One of Gunther's guards.\n\nThree shots sizzled out, and Marnagan bellowed.\n\nThe strange harsh voice said, \"That's better. Don't try and pick that\ngun up now. Oh, so it's you. I thought Gunther had finished you off.\nHow'd you get past the animals?\"\n\nClick started running. He switched off his _sending_ audio, kept his\n_receiving_ on. Marnagan, weaponless. _One_ guard. Click gasped. Things\nwere getting dark. Had to have air. Air. Air. He ran and kept running\nand listening to Marnagan's lying voice:\n\n\"I tied them pink elephants of Gunther's in neat alphabetical bundles\nand stacked them up to dry, ya louse!\" Marnagan said. \"But, damn you,\nthey killed my partner before he had a chance!\"\n\nThe guard laughed.\n\n\n\nThe air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his head\nswimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. He\nlet himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn't\nhave a weapon. Oh, damn, damn!\n\nA tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in that\nyellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked,\nair hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, a\nproton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guard\nhad his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: \"I think I'll let\nyou stand right there and die,\" he said quietly. \"That what Gunther\nwanted, anway. A nice sordid death.\"\n\nHathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him.\n\n\"Don't move!\" he snapped. \"I've got a weapon stronger than yours. One\ntwitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behind\nyou! Freeze!\"\n\nThe guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, dropped\nhis gun to the floor.\n\n\"Get his gun, Irish.\"\n\nMarnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward.\n\nHathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. \"Thanks for\nposing,\" he said. \"That shot will go down in film history for candid\nacting.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the door\nleading into the Base?\"\n\nThe guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder.\n\nClick was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air.\n\"Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Double\ntime! Double!\"\n\nTen minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen on\ntheir backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard,\nhid him in a huge trash receptacle. \"Where he belongs,\" observed Irish\ntersely.\n\nThey found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothing\nmore than a honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged.\nPerfect front for a raider who had little equipment and was\nshort-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships to\nrocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them for\ncargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and the\nswarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren't\nwanted. They were scared off.\n\nThe telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank of\nintricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored film\nwith images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated them\ninto thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius.\n\n\"So here we are, still not much better off than we were,\" growled\nIrish. \"We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turn\nup any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project the\nmonsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?\"\n\n\"What good would that do?\" Hathaway gnawed his lip. \"They wouldn't fool\nthe engineers who created them, you nut.\"\n\nMarnagan exhaled disgustedly. \"Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would come\nriding over the hill--\"\n\n\n\n\"Irish!\" Hathaway snapped that, his face lighting up. \"Irish. The U.S.\nCavalry it is!\" His eyes darted over the machines. \"Here. Help me.\nWe'll stage everything on the most colossal raid of the century.\"\n\nMarnagan winced. \"You breathing oxygen or whiskey?\"\n\n\"There's only one stipulation I make, Irish. I want a complete picture\nof Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want a picture of Gunther's face\nwhen you do it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work to do. How good an\nactor are you?\"\n\n\"That's a silly question.\"\n\n\"You only have to do three things. Walk with your gun out in front of\nyou, firing. That's number one. Number two is to clutch at your heart\nand fall down dead. Number three is to clutch at your side, fall down\nand twitch on the ground. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Clear as the Coal Sack Nebula....\"\n\nAn hour later Hathaway trudged down a passageway that led out into a\nsort of city street inside the asteroid. There were about six streets,\nlined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a\nwide, green-lawned Plaza.\n\nHathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked\nacross the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that\nwas pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters.\n\nHe got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back.\n\nHe didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and\npushed him into a room where Gunther sat.\n\nHathaway looked at him. \"So you're Gunther?\" he said, calmly. The\npirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken,\nquestioningly dark eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of\nmetal-link cloth. He glanced up from a paper-file, surprised. Before he\ncould speak, Hathaway said:\n\n\"Everything's over with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol is in the city now and\nwe're capturing your Base. Don't try to fight. We've a thousand men\nagainst your eighty-five.\"\n\nGunther sat there, blinking at Hathaway, not moving. His thin hands\ntwitched in his lap. \"You are bluffing,\" he said, finally, with a firm\ndirectness. \"A ship hasn't landed here for an hour. Your ship was the\nlast. Two people were on it. The last I saw of them they were being\npursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed.\"\n\n\"Both. The other guy went after the Patrol.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"I can't respect your opinion, Mr. Gunther.\"\n\nA shouting rose from the Plaza. About fifty of Gunther's men, lounging\non carved benches during their time-off, stirred to their feet and\nstarted yelling. Gunther turned slowly to the huge window in one side\nof his office. He stared, hard.\n\nThe Patrol was coming!\n\nAcross the Plaza, marching quietly and decisively, came the Patrol.\nFive hundred Patrolmen in one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis\nguns with them in their tight hands.\n\nGunther babbled like a child, his voice a shrill dagger in the air.\n\"Get out there, you men! Throw them back! We're outnumbered!\"\n\nGuns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway\nhad to credit them on that. They took it, standing.\n\nHathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was.\nHis camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him\nfrom filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was\nthrowing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his\nfragile, bony legs and their atrophied state.\n\nSome of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three\nof the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and\ntwitch. God, what photography!\n\nGunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He\nfired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight.\nThen Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos\ntaking place immediately outside his window.\n\nThe pirates broke and fled, those that were left. A mere handful. And\nout of the chaos came Marnagan's voice, \"Here!\"\n\n\n\nOne of the Patrolmen stopped firing, and ran toward Click and the\nBuilding. He got inside. \"Did you see them run, Click boy? What an\nidea. How did we do?\"\n\n\"Fine, Irish. Fine!\"\n\n\"So here's Gunther, the spalpeen! Gunther, the little dried up pirate,\neh?\" Marnagan whacked Hathaway on the back. \"I'll have to hand it to\nyou, this is the best plan o' battle ever laid out. And proud I was to\nfight with such splendid men as these--\" He gestured toward the Plaza.\n\nClick laughed with him. \"You should be proud. Five hundred Patrolmen\nwith hair like red banners flying, with thick Irish brogues and broad\nshoulders and freckles and blue eyes and a body as tall as your\nstories!\"\n\nMarnagan roared. \"I always said, I said--if ever there could be an\narmy of Marnagans, we could lick the whole damn uneeverse! Did you\nphotograph it, Click?\"\n\n\"I did.\" Hathaway tapped his camera happily.\n\n\"Ah, then, won't that be a scoop for you, boy? Money from the Patrol so\nthey can use the film as instruction in Classes and money from Cosmic\nFilms for the news-reel headlines! And what a scene, and what acting!\nFive hundred duplicates of Steve Marnagan, broadcast telepathically\ninto the minds of the pirates, walking across a Plaza, capturing the\nwhole she-bang! How did you like my death-scenes?\"\n\n\"You're a ham. And anyway--five hundred duplicates, nothing!\" said\nClick. He ripped the film-spool from the camera, spread it in the air\nto develop, inserted it in the micro-viewer. \"Have a look--\"\n\nMarnagan looked. \"Ah, now. Ah, now,\" he said over and over. \"There's\nthe Plaza, and there's Gunther's men fighting and then they're turning\nand running. And what are they running from? One man! Me. Irish\nMarnagan! Walking all by myself across the lawn, paralyzing them. One\nagainst a hundred, and the cowards running from me!\n\n\"Sure, Click, this is better than I thought. I forgot that the film\nwouldn't register telepathic emanations, them other Marnagans. It\nmakes it look like I'm a mighty brave man, does it not? It does. Ah,\nlook--look at me, Hathaway, I'm enjoying every minute of it, I am.\"\n\n\n\nHathaway swatted him on his back-side. \"Look here, you egocentric son\nof Erin, there's more work to be done. More pirates to be captured. The\nPatrol is still marching around and someone might be suspicious if they\nlooked too close and saw all that red hair.\"\n\n\"All right, Click, we'll clean up the rest of them now. We're a\ncombination, we two, we are. I take it all back about your pictures,\nClick, if you hadn't thought of taking pictures of me and inserting\nit into those telepath machines we'd be dead ducks now. Well--here I\ngo....\"\n\nHathaway stopped him. \"Hold it. Until I load my camera again.\"\n\nIrish grinned. \"Hurry it up. Here come three guards. They're unarmed.\nI think I'll handle them with me fists for a change. The gentle art of\nuppercuts. Are you ready, Hathaway?\"\n\n\"Ready.\"\n\nMarnagan lifted his big ham-fists.\n\nThe camera whirred. Hathaway chuckled, to himself.\n\nWhat a sweet fade-out this was!\n",
