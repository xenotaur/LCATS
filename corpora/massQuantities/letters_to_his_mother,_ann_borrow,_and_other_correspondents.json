I was selling so many Testaments that\nthe Priests became alarmed, and prevailed on the government to put a stop\nto my selling any more.  They were likewise talking of prosecuting me as\na Witch, but they have thought better of it.\n\nI hear it is very cold in England.  Pray take care of yourself.  I shall\nsend you more in a few weeks.\n\n                                                            God bless you,\n                                                             My Dear Mama,\n                                                                     G. B.\n\n\n\nLetter II.\n_To_ A Correspondent.\n\n\n                                                                   OULTON,\n                                                                LOWESTOFT,\n                                                                  SUFFOLK.\n                                                    _August_ 11_th_, 1843.\n\nMY DEAR SIR,\n\nMany thanks for your interesting and kind letter, in which you do me the\nhonour to ask my opinion respecting the pedigree of your island goblin,\n_le feu follet Belenger_; that opinion I cheerfully give, with a promise\nthat it is only an opinion; in hunting for the etymons of these fairy\nnames we can scarcely expect to arrive at any thing like certainty.\n\nI suppose you are aware that the name of Bilenger, or Billinger, is of\noccasional though by no means frequent occurrence both in England and\nFrance.  You have heard of Billings-gate, and of Billing-ham, the\nunfortunate assassin of poor Percival.  Likewise of Billing-ton, all\nmodifications of the same root: Belingart, Bilings-home or Billing-ston.\nBut what is Billin_ger_?  Clearly that which is connected some way or\nother with Billing.  You will find _ger_, or something like it, in most\nEuropean tongues\u2014Boulan_ger_, horolo_ger_, tal_ker_ wal_ker_, ba_ker_,\nbre_wer_, beg_gar_.  In Welsh it is of frequent occurrence in the shape\nof _ur_ or _gwr_\u2014hin_ur_ (an elder), her_wr_ (a prow_ler_); in Russian\nthe ger, gwr, ur, er, appears in the shape of _ik_ or _k_\u2014Sapojgn_ik_, a\nshoemaker, Chinobu_ik_, a man possessed of rank.  The root of all these,\nas well as of _or_ in Senator, victor, etc., is the same as _ker_ or\n_kir_; which means, Lord, master, maker, doer, possessor of something or\nconnected with something.\n\nWe want now to come at the meaning of Beling or Billing, which probably\nmeans some action, or some moral or personal attribute.  Bolvile in\nAnglo-Saxon means honest, Danish Bollig; Wallen, in German, to wanken or\nmove restlessly about; Baylan, in Spanish, to dance, connected with which\nare to whirl, to fling, and possibly Walloon and Fleming.\n\nBelenger therefore may mean a Billiger or honest fellow, or it may mean a\nWalter-_ger_, a whirl_enger_, a flinger or something connected with\nrestless motion.\n\nAllow me to draw your attention to the word \u201cWill\u201d in the English word\n\u201cWill of the wisp.\u201d   It must not be supposed that this \u201cWill\u201d is the\nabbreviation of William; it is pure Danish, \u201cVild,\u201d pronounced \u201cwill,\u201d\nand signifies wild, \u201cVilden Visk; Vilden Visk,\u201d the wild or moving wisp.\nI can adduce another instance of the corruption of the Danish \u201cvild\u201d into\n\u201cwill.\u201d  The rustics of this part of England are in the habit of saying\n\u201cthey are led will\u201d (vild or wild), when from intoxication or some other\ncause they are bewildered at night and cannot find their way home.  This\nexpression is clearly from the old Norse or Danish.  I am not at all\ncertain that \u201cBil\u201d in Bilinger may not be this same \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cVild,\u201d and\nthat the word may not be a corruption of Vilden, old or elder, wild or\nflying fire.\n\nIt has likewise occurred to me that Bilinger may be derived from\n\u201cVolundr,\u201d the worship of the blacksmith or Northern Vulcan.\n\n\n\nLETTER III.\n_To_ MARY BORROW.\n\n\n                                                           Constantinople.\n                                                 _September_ 16_th_, 1844.\n\nMY DARLING CARRETA,\n\nI am about to leave Constantinople and to return home.  I have given up\nthe idea of going to Russia.  I find that if I go to Odessa I shall have\nto remain in quarantine for fourteen days, which I have no inclination to\ndo; I am moreover anxious to get home, being quite tired of wandering,\nand desirous of being once more with my loved ones.\n\nThis is a most interesting place, but unfortunately it is extremely dear.\nThe Turks have no inns, and I am here at an English one, at which, though\neverything is comfortable, the prices are very high.  To-day is Monday,\nand next Friday I purpose starting for Salonica, in a steamboat\u2014Salonica\nis in Albania.  I shall then cross Albania, a journey of about three\nhundred miles, and get to Corfu, from which I can either get to England\nacross Italy and down the Rhine, or by way of Marseilles and across\nFrance.  I shall not make any stay in Italy if I go there, as I have\nnothing to see there.\n\nI shall be so glad to be at home with you once again, and to see my dear\nmother and Hen.  Tell Hen that I picked up for her in one of the bazaars\na curious Armenian coin; it is silver, small, but thick, with a most\ncurious inscription upon it.  I gave fifteen piasters for it.  I hope it\nand the rest will get safe to England.  I have bought a chest, which I\nintend to send by sea, and I have picked up a great many books and other\nthings, and I wish to travel light; I shall, therefore, only take a bag\nwith a few clothes and shirts.  It is possible that I shall be at home\nsoon after your receiving this, or at most three weeks after\u2014I hope to\nwrite to you again from Corfu, which is a British island with a British\ngarrison in it, like Gibraltar.\n\nThe English newspapers came last week.  I see those wretched French\ncannot let us alone, they want to go to war; well, let them\u2014they richly\ndeserve a good drubbing.  The people here are very kind in their way, but\nhome is home, especially such a one as mine, with true hearts to welcome\nme.\n\nOh, I was so glad to get your letters; they were rather of a distant\ndate, it is true, but they quite revived me.  I hope you are all well,\nand my dear mother.  Since I have been here I have written to Mr. Lord.\nI was glad to hear that he has written to Hen.  I hope Lucy is well; pray\nremember me most kindly to her, and tell her that I hope to see her soon.\nI count so on getting into my summer-house again, and sitting down to\nwrite; I have arranged my book in my mind, and though it will take me a\ngreat deal of trouble to write it, I feel that when it is written it will\nbe first-rate.\n\nMy journey with God\u2019s help has done me a great deal of good\u2014I am stronger\nthan I was, and I can now sleep.  I intend to draw on England for forty\nor fifty pounds; if I don\u2019t want the whole of it, it will be all the\nsame.  I have still some money left, but I have no wish to be stopped on\nmy journey for want of it.  I am sorry about what you told me respecting\nthe railway, sorry that the old coach is driven off the road.  I shall\npatronise it as little as possible, but stick to the old route and\nThurton George.  What a number of poor people will these railroads\ndeprive of their bread.  I am grieved at what you say about poor M.  He\ncan take her into custody however, and oblige her to support the\nchildren; such is law, though the property may have been secured to her,\nshe can be compelled to do that.\n\nTell Hen that there is a mosque here, called the mosque of Sultan\nBajazet; it is full of sacred pigeons; there is a corner of the court to\nwhich the creatures flock to be fed, like bees, by hundreds and\nthousands; they are not at all afraid, as they are never killed.  Every\nplace where they can roost is covered with them, their impudence is\ngreat; they sprang originally from two pigeons brought from Asia by the\nEmperor of Constantinople.  They are of a deep blue.\n\n                                                   God bless you, dearest,\n                                                                     G. B.\n\n\n\nLETTER IV.\n_To_ MARY BORROW.\n\n\n                                                                   OXFORD.\n                                                  _February_ 2_nd_, [1846]\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI reached this place yesterday, and hope to be home to-night (Monday).  I\nwalked the whole way by Kingston, Hampton, Sunbury (Miss Oriel\u2019s place),\nWindsor, Wallingford, &c.\u2014a good part of the way by the Thames.  There\nhas been much wet weather.  Oxford is a wonderful place.  Kiss Hen, and\nGod bless you!\n\n\n\nLETTER V.\n_To_ MARY BORROW.\n\n\n                                                          TUNBRIDGE WELLS,\n                                                        _Tuesday evening_.\n                                                                    [1846]\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI have arrived here safe.  It is a wonderful place, a small city of\npalaces amidst hills, rocks, and woods, and is full of fine people.\nPlease to carry upstairs and lock in the drawer the little paper sack of\nletters in the parlour; lock it up with the bank book, and put this along\nwith it\u2014also be sure to keep the window of my room fastened and the door\nlocked, and keep the key in your pocket.  God bless you and Hen.\n\n\n\nLETTER VI.\n_To_ MARY BORROW.\n\n\n                                                      _Tuesday afternoon_,\n                                                                    [1848]\n\nMY DEAR WIFE,\n\nI just write you a line to tell you that I am tolerably well, as I hope\nyou are.\n\nEverything is in confusion abroad.  The French King has disappeared and\nwill probably never be heard of, though they are expecting him in\nEngland.  Funds are down nearly to 80.  The Government have given up the\nincome tax, and people are very glad of it.  I am not.  With respect to\nthe funds, if I were to sell out I should not know what to do with the\nmoney.  J. says they will rise.  I do not think they will; they may,\nhowever, fluctuate a little.\n\nKeep up your spirits, my heart\u2019s dearest, and kiss old Hen for me.\n\n                                                                     G. B.\n\n\n\nLETTER VII.\n_To_ MARY BORROW.\n\n\n                                                            53A PALL MALL.\n                                                                    [1848]\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI hope you received my last letter written on Tuesday.\n\nI am glad that I came to London.  I find myself much the better for\nhaving done so, I was going on in a very spiritless manner.  Everybody I\nhave met seems very kind and glad to see me.  Murray seems to be\nthoroughly staunch.  Cooke, to whom I mentioned the F. T. says that\nMurray was delighted with the idea, and will be very glad of the 4th of\n_Lavengro_.  I am going to dine with Murray today, Thursday.  W. called\nupon me today.\n\nI wish you would send me a blank cheque in a letter so that if I want\nmoney I may be able to draw for a little.  I shall not be long from home,\nbut now I am here I wish to do all that\u2019s necessary.  If you send me a\nblank cheque I suppose W. or M. would give me the money.  I hope you got\nmy last letter.  I received yours, and C. has just sent the two copies of\nL. you wrote for, and I believe some engravings of the picture.  I shall\nwish to return it by the packet if possible, and will let you know when I\nam coming.  I hope to write again shortly to tell you some more news.\nHow is mother and Hen and how are the creatures?  I hope all well.  I\ntrust you like all I propose; now I am here I want to get two or three\nthings, to go to the Museum, and to arrange matters.\n\nGod bless you.\n\nLove to Mother and Hen.\n\n\n\nLETTER VIII.\n_To_ MARY BORROW.\n\n\n                                                             58 JERMYN ST,\n                                                               ST. JAMES\u2019,\n                                                                    [1848]\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI got here safe, and upon the whole had not so bad a journey as might be\nexpected.  I put up at the Spread Eagle for the night, for I was tired\nand hungry.  I have got into my old lodgings as you see, those on the\nsecond floor.  They are very nice ones with every convenience; they are\nexpensive it is true, but they are cheerful, which is a grand\nconsideration for me.  I have as yet seen nobody, for it is only now a\nlittle past eleven.  I can scarcely at present tell you what my plans\nare, perhaps tomorrow I shall write again.  Kiss Hen, and God bless you.\n\n                                                                     G. B.\n\n\n\nLETTER IX.\n_To_ MARY BORROW.\n\n\n                                                             58 JERMYN ST,\n                                                               ST. JAMES\u2019,\n                                                              _Wednesday_,\n                                                                    [1848]\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI was glad to receive your letter, I had expected one on Tuesday.  I am\nupon the whole very comfortable, and people are kind.  I passed last\nSunday at Clapham with Mrs. Browne, I was glad to go there for it was a\ngloomy day.  They are now glad enough to ask me.\n\nI suppose I must stay in London through next week.  I have been invited\nto two grand parties, and it is as well to have something for one\u2019s\nmoney.  I called at the Bible Society\u2014all remarkably civil, Joseph\nespecially so.  I think I shall be able to manage with my own Dictionary.\nThere is now a great demand for Morrison.\n\nYesterday I again dined at the Murray\u2019s, there was a family party\u2014very\npleasant.  To-morrow I dine with an old schoolfellow.  Murray is talking\nof printing a new edition {25} to sell for 5 shillings.  Those rascals\nthe Americans have it seems reprinted it, and are selling it for\n_eighteen_ pence.  Murray says he shall print ten thousand copies; it is\nchiefly intended for the Colonies.  He says the rich people and the\nlibraries have already got it, and he is quite right, for nearly three\nthousand copies have been sold at 27_s._!  There is no longer the high\nprofit to be made on books there formerly was, as the rascals abroad\npirate the good ones, and in the present state of copyright there is no\nhelp: we can, however, keep the American editions out of the Colonies,\nwhich is something.\n\nI have nothing more to say, save to commend you not to go on the water\nwithout _I_; perhaps you would be overset; and do not go to the bridge\nagain, \u2019till I come.  Take care of Habismilk and Craffs.  Kiss the little\nmare, and old Hen.\n\n\n\nLETTER X.\n_To_ MARY BORROW.\n\n\n                                                                 PENQUITO,\n                                                   _January_ 27_th_, 1854.\n\nMY DEAR CARRETA,\n\nI just write you a line to inform you that I have got back safe from the\nLand\u2019s End.  I have received your two letters, and hope you received mine\nfrom the Land\u2019s End.  It is probable that I shall yet visit one or two\nplaces before I leave Cornwall.  I am very much pleased with the country.\nWhen you receive this if you please to write a line _by return of post_ I\nthink you may; the Tredinnock people wish me to stay with them for a day\nor two.  When you see the Cobbs pray remember me to them.  I am sorry\nHorace has lost his aunt, he will _miss her_.  Love to Hen.\n\n                                                      Ever yours, dearest,\n                                                                G.

God bless you\nand Hen,\n\n                                                                J.

Since I saw you I\nhave walked about 250 miles.  I walked the whole way from the North to\nthe South, then turning to the East traversed Glamorganshire and the\ncounty of Monmouth, and came out at Chepstow.  My boots were worn up by\nthe time I reached Swansea, and I was obliged to get them new soled and\nwelted.  I walked every inch of the way.\n\nI have seen wonderful mountains, waterfalls, and people.  On the side of\nthe Black Mountains I met a cartload of real Gypsies.  They were in a\ndreadful rage, and were abusing the country right and left.  My last\nninety miles proved not very comfortable, there was so much rain.\n\nPray let me have some money by Monday, as I am nearly without any, as you\nmay well suppose, for I was three weeks on my journey.  I left you on a\nThursday, and reached Chepstow yesterday, Thursday evening.  I hope you,\nmy mother, and Hen are well.  I have seen M. and C.\n\n(_Keep this_)\n\n\n\nLETTER XIII.\n_To_ MARY BORROW.\n\n\n                                                                TRECASTLE,\n                                                           BRECKNOCKSHIRE,\n                                                              SOUTH WALES.\n                                                    _August_ 17_th_, 1857.\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI write to you a few words from this place; tomorrow I am going to\nLlandovery and from there to Carmarthen.  For the first three or four\ndays I had dreadful weather.  I got only to Worthen the first day, twelve\nmiles, on the next to Montgomery, and so on.  It is now very hot; but I\nam very well, much better than at Shrewsbury.  I hope in a few days to\nwrite to you again, and soon to be back to you.\n\nGod bless you and Hen.\n\n                                                                G. BORROW.\n\n\n\nLETTER XIV.\n_To_ MARY BORROW.\n\n\n                                                                INVERNESS,\n                                                 _September_ 29_th_, 1858.\n\nMY DEAR CARRETA,\n\nI have got your letter, and glad enough I was to get it.  The day after\nto-morrow I shall depart from here for Fort Augustus, at some distance up\nthe lake.  After staying a few days there, I am thinking of going to the\nIsle of Mull, but I will write to you if possible from Fort Augustus.\n\nI am rather sorry that I came to Scotland\u2014I was never in such a place in\nmy life for cheating and imposition, and the farther north you go the\nworse things seem to be.  And yet I believe it is possible to live very\ncheaply here, that is if you have a house of your own and a wife to go\nout and make bargains; for things are abundant enough, but if you move\nabout you are at the mercy of innkeepers and suchlike people.\n\nThe other day I was swindled out of a shilling by a villain to whom I had\ngiven it for change.  I ought, perhaps, to have had him up before a\nmagistrate, provided I could have found one.  But I was in a wild place,\nand he had a clan about him, and if I had had him up I have no doubt I\nshould have been outsworn.  I, however, have met one fine, noble old\nfellow.  The other night I lost my way amongst horrible moors, and\nwandered for miles and miles without seeing a soul.  At last I saw a\nlight, which came from the window of a rude hovel.  I tapped, at the\nwindow, and shouted, and at last an old man came out.  He asked me what I\nwanted, and I told him I had lost my way.  He asked me where I came from,\nand where I wanted to go; and on my telling him he said I had indeed lost\nmy way, for I had got out of it at least four miles, and was going away\nfrom the place I wanted to get to.  He then said he would show me the\nway, and went with me for several miles over most horrible places.  At\nlast we came to a road where he said he thought he might leave me, and\nwished me goodnight.  I gave him a shilling.  He was very grateful, and\nsaid, after considering, that as I had behaved so handsomely to him he\nwould not leave me yet, as he thought it possible I might yet lose my\nway.  He then went with me three miles farther, and I have no doubt that,\nbut for him, I should have lost my way again the roads were so tangled.\nI never saw such an old fellow, or one whose conversation was so odd and\nentertaining.  This happened last Monday night, the night of the day in\nwhich I had been swindled of the shilling by the other; I could write a\nhistory about those two shillings.\n\n\n\nLETTER XV.\n_To_ MRS. MACOUBREY.\n\n\n                                                                   OULTON,\n                                                                LOWESTOFT.\n                                                      _April_ 1_st_, 1874.\n\nDEAR HENRIETTA,\n\nI have received your letter of the 30th March.  Since I last wrote I have\nnot been well.  I have had a great pain in the left jaw, which almost\nprevented me from eating.  I am, however, better now.\n\nI shall be glad to see you and Dr. MacOubrey as soon as you can\nconveniently come.  Send me a line to say when I may expect you.  I have\nno engagements.\n\nBefore you come call at No. 36 to enquire whether anything has been sent\nthere.  Leverton had better be employed to make a couple of boxes or\ncases for the books in the sacks.  The sacks can be put on the top in the\ninside.  There is an old coat in one of the sacks in the pocket of which\nare papers.  Let it be put in with its contents just as it is.  I wish to\nhave the long white chest and the two deal boxes also brought down.  Buy\nme a thick under-waistcoat like the one I am now wearing, and a lighter\none for the summer.  Worsted socks are of no use\u2014they scarcely last a\nday.  Cotton ones are poor things, but they are better than worsted.\n\n                                            Kind regards to Dr. MacOubrey.\n                                                            God bless you!\n                                                          [GEORGE BORROW.]\n\nReturn me this when you come.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                                 LONDON:\n               Printed for THOMAS J.
