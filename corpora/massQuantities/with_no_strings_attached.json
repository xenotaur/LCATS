    "body": "The United States Submarine _Ambitious Brill_ slid smoothly into her\nberth in the Brooklyn Navy Yard after far too many weeks at sea, as\nfar as her crew were concerned. After all the necessary preliminaries\nhad been waded through, the majority of that happy crew went ashore to\nenjoy a well-earned and long-anticipated leave in the depths of the\nbrick-and-glass canyons of Gomorrah-on-the-Hudson.\n\nThe trip had been uneventful, in so far as nothing really dangerous\nor exciting had happened. Nothing, indeed, that could even be called\nout-of-the-way--except that there was more brass aboard than usual,\nand that the entire trip had been made underwater with the exception\nof one surfacing for a careful position check, in order to make sure\nthat the ship's instruments gave the same position as the stars gave.\nThey had. All was well.\n\nThat is not to say that the crew of the _Ambitious Brill_ were\nentirely satisfied in their own minds about certain questions that had\nbeen puzzling them. They weren't. But they knew better than to ask\nquestions, even among themselves. And they said nothing whatever when\nthey got ashore. But even the novices among submarine crews know that\nwhile the nuclear-powered subs like _George Washington_, _Patrick\nHenry_, or _Benjamin Franklin_ are perfectly capable of\ncircumnavigating the globe without coming up for air, such\nperformances are decidedly rare in a presumably Diesel-electric vessel\nsuch as the U.S.S. _Ambitious Brill_. And those few members of the\ncrew who had seen what went on in the battery room were the most\nsecretive and the most puzzled of all. They, and they alone, knew that\nsome of the cells of the big battery that drove the ship's electric\nmotors had been removed to make room for a big, steel-clad box hardly\nbigger than a foot locker, and that the rest of the battery hadn't\nbeen used at all.\n\nWith no one aboard but the duty watch, and no one in the battery room\nat all, Captain Dean Lacey felt no compunction whatever in saying, as\nhe gazed at the steel-clad, sealed box: \"What a battery!\"\n\nThe vessel's captain, Lieutenant Commander Newton Wayne, looked up\nfrom the box into the Pentagon representative's face. \"Yes, sir, it\nis.\" His voice sounded as though his brain were trying to catch up\nwith it and hadn't quite succeeded. \"This certainly puts us well ahead\nof the Russians.\"\n\nCaptain Lacey returned the look. \"How right you are, commander. This\nmeans we can convert every ship in the Navy in a tenth the time we had\nfigured.\"\n\nThen they both looked at the third man, a civilian.\n\nHe nodded complacently. \"And at a tenth the cost, gentlemen,\" he said\nmildly. \"North American Carbide & Metals can produce these units\ncheaply, and at a rate that will enable us to convert every ship in\nthe Navy within the year.\"\n\nCaptain Lacey shot a glance at Lieutenant Commander Wayne. \"All this\nis strictly Top Secret you understand.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I understand,\" said Wayne.\n\n\"Very well.\" He looked back at the civilian. \"Are we ready,\nMr. Thorn?\"\n\n\"Anytime you are, captain,\" the civilian said.\n\n\"Fine. You have your instructions, commander. Carry on.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Lieutenant Commander Wayne.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n   *       *       *       *       *\n\nA little less than an hour later, Captain Lacey and Mr. Thorn were in\nthe dining room of one of the most exclusive clubs in New York. Most\nclubs in New York are labeled as \"exclusive\" because they exclude\ncertain people who do not measure up to their standards of wealth.\nA man who makes less than, say, one hundred thousand dollars a year\nwould not even qualify for scrutiny by the Executive Committee. There\nis one club in Manhattan which reaches what is probably close to the\nlimit on that kind of exclusiveness: Members must be white,\nAnglo-Saxon, Protestant Americans who can trace their ancestry as\nwhite, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant Americans back at least as far as the\nAmerican Revolution _without exception_, and who are worth at least\nten millions, and who can show that the fortune came into the family\nat least four generations back. No others need apply. It is said that\nthis club is not a very congenial one because the two members hate\neach other.\n\nThe club in which Lacey and Thorn ate their dinner is not of that\nsort. It is composed of military and naval officers and certain\ncivilian career men in the United States Government. These men are\nprofessionals. Not one of them would ever resign from government\nservice. They are dedicated, heart, body, and soul to the United\nStates of America. The life, public and private, of every man Jack of\nthem is an open book to every other member. Of the three living men\nwho have held--and the one who at present holds--the title of\nPresident of the United States, only one was a member of the club\nbefore he held that high office.\n\nAs an exclusive club, they rank well above England's House of Peers\nand just a shade below the College of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic\nChurch.\n\nCaptain Lacey was a member. Mr. Richard Thorn was not, but he was\namong those few who qualify to be invited as guests. The carefully\nguarded precincts of the club were among the very few in which these\ntwo men could talk openly and at ease.\n\nAfter the duck came the brandy, both men having declined dessert. And\nover the brandy--that ultra-rare Five Star Hennessy which is\nprocurable only by certain people and is believed by many not to exist\nat all--Captain Lacey finally asked the question that had been\nbothering him for so long.\n\n\"Thorn,\" he said, \"three months ago that battery didn't exist. I know\nit and you know it. Who was the genius who invented it?\"\n\nThorn smiled, and there was a subtle wryness in the smile. \"Genius is\nthe word, I suppose. Now that the contracts with the Navy have been\nsigned, I can give you the straight story. But you're wrong in saying\nthat the thing didn't exist three months ago. It did. We just didn't\nknow about it, that's all.\"\n\nLacey raised his bushy, iron-gray eyebrows. \"Oh? And how did it come\nto the attention of North American Carbide & Metals?\"\n\nThorn puffed out his cheeks and blew out his breath softly before he\nbegan talking, as though he were composing his beginning sentences in\nhis mind. Then he said: \"The first I heard about it was four months\nago. Considering what's happened since then, it seems a lot longer.\"\nHe inhaled deeply from his brandy snifter before continuing. \"As head\nof the development labs for NAC&M, I was asked to take part as a\nwitness to a demonstration that had been arranged through some of the\nother officers of the company. It was to take place out on Salt Lake\nFlats, where--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n   *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was to take place out on Salt Lake Flats, where there was no chance\nof hanky-panky. Richard Thorn--who held a Ph.D. from one of the finest\ntechnological colleges in the East, but who preferred to be addressed\nas \"Mister\"--was in a bad mood. He had flown all the way out to Salt\nLake City after being given only a few hours notice, and then had been\nbundled into a jeep furnished by the local sales office of NAC&M and\nscooted off to the blinding gray-white glare of the Salt Flats. It was\nhot and it was much too sunshiny for Thorn. But he had made the\narrangements for the test himself, so he couldn't argue or complain\ntoo loudly. He could only complain mildly to himself that the business\noffice of the company, which had made the final arrangements, had, in\nhis opinion, been a little too much in a hurry to get the thing over\nwith. Thorn himself felt that the test could have at least waited\nuntil the weather cooled off. The only consolation he had was that,\nout here, the humidity was so low that he could stay fairly\ncomfortable in spite of the heat as long as there was plenty of\ndrinking water. He had made sure to bring plenty.\n\nThe cavalcade of vehicles arrived at the appointed spot--umpteen miles\nfrom nowhere--and pulled up in a circle.\n\nThorn climbed out wearily and saw the man who called himself Sorensen\nclimb out of the second jeep.\n\nFrom the first time he had seen him, Thorn had tagged Sorensen as an\nAngry Old Man. Not that he was really getting old; he was still\nsomewhere on the brisk side of fifty. But he wore a perpetual scowl on\nhis face that looked as though it had been etched there by too many\nyears of frustration, and his voice always seemed to have an acid edge\nto it, like that of an old man who has decided, after decades of\nobservation, that all men are fools. And yet Thorn thought he\noccasionally caught a glimpse of mocking humor in the pale blue eyes.\nHe was lean and rather tall, with white hair that still showed traces\nof blond, and he looked as Scandinavian as his name sounded. His\naccent was pure Minnesota American.\n\nAs he climbed out of the jeep, Sorensen brought with him the Black\nSuitcase.\n\nEver since he had first seen it, Thorn had thought of it as \"the Black\nSuitcase,\" and after he had seen some of the preliminary tests, he had\nsubconsciously put capitals to the words. But Richard Thorn was no\nfool. Too many men had been suckered before, and he, Richard Thorn,\ndid not intend to be another sucker, no matter how impressed he might\nbe by the performance of an invention.\n\nIf this was a con game, it was going to have to be a good one to get\nby Richard Thorn, Ph.D.\n\nHe walked across the few feet of hard, salt-white ground that\nseparated him from Sorensen standing beside the second jeep with the\nBlack Suitcase in his hand. It was obvious to anyone who watched the\nway Sorensen handled the thing that it was heavy--seventy-five pounds\nor better.\n\n\"Need any help?\" Thorn asked, knowing what the answer would be.\n\n\"Nope,\" Sorensen said. \"I can handle it.\"\n\nThe suitcase wasn't really black. It was a dark cordovan brown, made\neven darker by long usage, which had added oily stains to the\nwell-used leather. But Thorn thought of it as the Black Suitcase\nsimply because it was the perfect example of the proverbial Little\nBlack Box--the box that Did Things. As a test question in an\nexamination, the Little Black Box performs a useful function. The\nexaminer draws a symbolic electronic circuit. Somewhere in the\ncircuit, instead of drawing the component that is supposed to be\nthere, he draws a Little Black Box. Then he defines the wave-form,\nvoltage, and amperage entering the circuit and defines whatever is\ncoming out. Question: What is in the Little Black Box?\n\nExcept in the simplest of cases, there is never an absolute answer.\nThe question is counted as correct if the student puts into the Little\nBlack Box a component or subcircuit which will produce the effect\ndesired. The value of the answer depends on the simplicity and\nrelative controllability of the component drawn in the place of the\nLittle Black Box.\n\nSorensen's Black Suitcase was still a problem to Thorn. He couldn't\nquite figure out what was in it.\n\n\"Hotter'n Billy Blue Blazes!\" Sorensen said as he put the Black\nSuitcase down on the gleaming white ground. He grinned a little, which\ndispelled for a moment his Angry Old Man expression, and said: \"You\nready to go, Mr. Thorn?\"\n\n\"I'm ready any time you are,\" Thorn said grumpily.\n\nSorensen looked at the NAC&M scientist sideways. \"You don't sound any\nhappier'n I am, Mr. Thorn.\"\n\nThorn looked at him and thought he could see that flash of odd humor\nin his light blue eyes. Thorn exhaled a heavy breath. \"I'm no happier\nthan you are to be out in this heat. Let's get on with it.\"\n\nSorensen's chuckle sounded so out of place that Thorn was almost\nstartled. \"You know the difference between you and me, Mr. Thorn?\"\nSorensen asked. He didn't wait for an answer. \"You think this test is\nprobably a waste of time. Me, on the other hand, I _know_ it is.\"\n\n\"Let's get on with it,\" Thorn repeated.\n\n\n\nIt took two hours to set up the equipment, in spite of the fact that a\nlot of the circuits had been prefabricated before the caravan had come\nout from Salt Lake City. But Richard Thorn wanted to make certain that\nall his data was both correct and recorded. Sorensen had nothing to do\nbut watch. He had no hand in setting up the equipment. He had brought\nthe Black Suitcase, and that was all he was going to be allowed to do.\n\nFrom the top of the Black Suitcase projected two one-inch copper\nelectrodes, fourteen inches apart. The North American Carbide & Metals\ntechnicians set up the circuits that were connected to the electrodes\nwithout any help from Sorensen.\n\nBut just before they started to work, Sorensen said: \"There's just one\nthing I think you ought to warn those men about, Mr. Thorn.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" Thorn asked.\n\n\"If any of 'em tries to open that suitcase, they're likely to get\nblown sky high. And I don't want 'em getting funny with me, either.\"\n\nHe had his hand in his trouser pocket, and Thorn was suddenly quite\ncertain that the man was holding a revolver. He could see the outlines\nagainst the cloth.\n\nThorn sighed. \"Don't worry, Mr. Sorensen. We don't have any ulterior\ndesigns on your invention.\" He did not add that the investigators of\nNAC&M had already assumed that anyone who was asking one million\ndollars for an invention which was, in effect, a pig in a poke, would\nbe expected to take drastic methods to protect his gadget. But there\nwould be no point in telling Sorensen that his protective efforts had\nalready been anticipated and that the technicians had already been\nwarned against touching the Black Suitcase any more than necessary to\nconnect the leads. Giving Sorensen that information might make him\neven more touchy.\n\nThorn only hoped that the bomb, or whatever it was that Sorensen had\nput in the suitcase, was well built, properly fused, and provided with\nadequate safeties.\n\nWhen everything was set up, Sorensen walked over to his device and\nturned it on by shoving the blade of a heavy-duty switch into place.\n\"O.K.,\" he said.\n\nOne of the technicians began flipping other switches, and a bank of\nordinary incandescent light bulbs came on, four at a time. Finally\nthere were one hundred of them burning, each one a hundred-watt bulb\nthat glowed brightly but did not appear to be contributing much to the\ngeneral brightness of the Utah sun. The technicians checked their\nrecording voltmeters and ammeters and reported that, sure enough, some\nten kilowatts of power at a little less than one hundred fifteen volts\nD.C. was coming from the Black Suitcase.\n\nSorensen and Thorn sat in the tent which had been erected to ward off\nthe sun's rays. They watched the lights shine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n   *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the technicians came in, wiping his forehead with a big blue\nbandana. \"Well, there she goes. Mr. Sorensen, if that thing is\ndangerous, hadn't we better back off a little way from it?\"\n\n\"It isn't dangerous,\" Sorensen said. \"Nothing's going to happen.\"\n\nThe technician looked unhappy. \"Then I don't see why we couldn't've\ntested the thing back in the shop. Would've been a lot easier there.\nTo say nothing of more comfortable.\"\n\nThorn lit a cigarette in silence.\n\nSorensen nodded and said, \"Yes, Mr. Siegel, it would've been.\"\n\nSiegel sat down on one of the camp stools and lit a cigarette.\n\"Mr. Sorensen,\" he asked in all innocence, \"have you got a patent on\nthat battery?\"\n\nThe humorous glint returned to Sorensen's eyes as he said, \"Nope.\nI didn't patent the battery in that suitcase. That's why I don't want\nanybody fooling around with it.\"\n\n\"How come you don't patent it?\" Siegel asked. \"Nobody could steal it\nif you patented it.\"\n\n\"Couldn't they?\" Sorensen asked with a touch of acid in his voice. \"Do\nyou know anything about batteries, Mr. Siegel?\"\n\n\"A little. I'm not an expert on 'em, or anything like that. I'm an\nelectrician. But I know a little bit about 'em.\"\n\nSorensen nodded. \"Then you should know, Mr. Siegel, that\nbattery-making is an art, not a science. You don't just stick a couple\nof electrodes into a solution of electrolyte and consider that your\nwork is done. With the same two metals and the same electrolyte, you\ncould make batteries that would run the gamut from terrible to\nexcellent. Some of 'em, maybe, wouldn't hold a charge more than an\nhour, while others would have a shelf-life, fully charged, of as much\nas a year. Batteries don't work according to theory. If they did,\npotassium chlorate would be a better depolarizer than manganese\ndioxide, instead of the other way around. What you get out of a\nvoltaic cell depends on the composition and strength of the\nelectrolyte, the kind of depolarizer used, the shape of the\nelectrodes, the kind of surface they have, their arrangement and\nspacing, and a hundred other little things.\"\n\n\"I've heard that,\" Siegel said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThorn smoked in silence. He had heard Sorensen's arguments before.\nSorensen didn't mind discussing his battery in the abstract, but he\nwas awfully close-mouthed when it came to talking about it in concrete\nterms. He would talk about batteries-in-general, but not about\nthis-battery-in-particular.\n\nNot that Thorn blamed him in the least. Sorensen was absolutely\ncorrect in his statements about the state of the art of making voltaic\ncells. If Sorensen had something new--and Thorn was almost totally\nconvinced that he did--then he was playing it smart by not trying to\npatent it.\n\n\"Now then,\" Sorensen went on, \"let's suppose that my battery is made\nup of lead and lead dioxide plates in a sulfuric acid solution, except\nthat I've added a couple of trifling things and made a few small\nchanges in the physical structure of the plates. I'm not saying that's\nwhat the battery is, mind you; I'm saying 'suppose'.\"\n\n\"O.K., suppose,\" said Siegel. \"Couldn't you patent it?\"\n\n\"What's to patent? The Pb-PbO_2-H_2SO_4 cell is about half as old as\nthe United States Patent Office itself. Can't patent that. Copper\noxide, maybe, as a depolarizer? Old hat; can't patent that. Laminated\nplates, maybe? Nope. Can't patent that, either.\"\n\nSiegel looked out at the hundred glowing light bulbs. \"You mean you\ncan't patent it, even if it works a hundred times better than an\nordinary battery?\"\n\n\"Hell, man,\" Sorensen said, \"you can't patent performance! You've got\nto patent something solid and concrete! Oh, I'll grant that a\ntop-notch patent attorney might be able to get me some kind of patent\non it, but I wouldn't trust its standing up in court if I had to try\nto quash an infringement.\n\n\"Besides, even if I had an iron-bound patent, what good would it do\nme? Ever hear of a patent pool?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Siegel. \"What's a patent pool?\"\n\n\"I'll give you an example. If all the manufacturers of a single\nproduct get together and agree to form a patent pool, it means that if\none company buys a patent, all of them can use it. Say the automobile\ncompanies have one. That means that if you invent a radical new design\nfor an engine--one, maybe that would save them millions of\ndollars--you'll be offered a few measly thousand for it. Why should\nthey offer more? _Where else are you going to sell it?_ If one company\ngets it, they all get it. There's no competition, and if you refuse to\nsell it at all, they just wait a few years until the patent runs out\nand use it for free. That may take a little time, but a big industry\nhas plenty of time. They have a longer life span than human beings.\"\n\n\"North American Carbide & Metals,\" said Thorn quietly, \"is not a\nmember of any patent pool, Mr. Sorensen.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Sorensen said agreeably. \"Battery patents are trickier than\nautomotive machinery patents. That's why I'm doing this my way. I'm\nnot selling the gadget as such. I'm selling results. For one million\ndollars, tax paid, I will agree to show your company how to build a\ndevice that will turn out electric power at such-and-such a rate and\nthat will have so-and-so characteristics, just like it says in the\ncontract you read. I guarantee that it can be made at the price I\nquote. That's all.\"\n\nHe looked back out at the bank of light bulbs. They were still\nburning. They kept burning--\n\n\"... They kept burning for ten solid hours,\" said Thorn. \"Then he went\nout and shut off his battery.\"\n\nCaptain Lacey was scowling. \"That's damned funny,\" he muttered.\n\n\"What is?\" asked Thorn, wondering why the naval officer had\ninterrupted his story.\n\n\"What you've been telling me,\" Lacey said. \"I'll swear I've heard--\"\nHe stopped and snapped his fingers suddenly. \"Sure! By golly!\" He\nstood up from the table. \"Would you excuse me for a minute? I want to\nsee if a friend of mine is here. If he is, he has a story you ought to\nhear. Damned funny coincidence.\" And he was off in a hurry, leaving\nThorn staring somewhat blankly after him.\n\nThree minutes later, while Thorn was busily pouring himself a second\nhelping of Five-Star Hennessy, Captain Lacey returned to the table\nwith an army officer wearing the insignia of a bird colonel.\n\n\"Colonel Dower,\" the captain said, \"I'd like you to meet a friend of\nmine--Mr. Richard Thorn, the top research man with North American\nCarbide & Metals. Mr. Thorn, this is Colonel Edward Dower.\" The men\nshook hands. A third brandy snifter was brought and a gentleman's\npotation was poured for the colonel.\n\n\"Ed,\" said Captain Lacey as soon as his fellow officer had inhaled a\ngoodly lungful of the heady fumes, \"do you remember you were telling\nme a couple of years ago about some test you were in on out in the\nMojave Desert?\"\n\nColonel Dower frowned. \"Test? Something to do with cars?\"\n\n\"No, not that one. Something to do with a power supply.\"\n\n\"Power supply. Oh!\" His frown faded and became a smile. \"You mean the\ncrackpot with his little suitcase.\"\n\nThorn looked startled, and Captain Lacey said: \"That's the one.\"\n\n\"Sure I remember,\" said the colonel. \"What about it?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" Lacey said with elaborate unconcern, \"I just thought\nMr. Thorn, here, might like to hear the story--that is, if it isn't\nclassified.\"\n\nColonel Dower chuckled. \"Nothing classified about it. Just another\ncrackpot inventor. Had a little suitcase that he claimed was a\nmarvelous new power source. Wanted a million dollars cash for it, tax\nfree, no strings attached, but he wouldn't show us what was in it. Not\nreally very interesting.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, colonel,\" said Thorn. \"I'm interested. Really I am.\"\n\n\"Well, as I said, there's nothing much to it,\" the colonel said. \"He\nshowed us a lot of impressive-looking stuff in his laboratory, but it\ndidn't mean a thing. He had this suitcase, as I told you. There were a\ncouple of thick copper electrodes coming out of the side of it, and he\nclaimed that they could be tapped for tremendous amounts of power.\nWell, we listened, and we watched his demonstrations in the lab. He\nran some heavy-duty motors off it and a few other things like that.\nI don't remember what all.\"\n\n\"And he wanted to sell it to you sight-unseen?\" Thorn asked.\n\n\"That's right,\" said the colonel. \"Well, actually, he wasn't trying to\nsell it to the Army. As you know, we don't buy ideas; all we buy is\nhardware, the equipment itself, or the components. But the company he\nwas trying to sell his gadget to wanted me to take a look at it as an\nobserver. I've had experience with that sort of thing, and they wanted\nmy opinion.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Thorn said. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the colonel, \"we wanted him to give us a demonstration\nout in the Mojave Desert--\"\n\n\n\n\"... Out in the Mojave Desert?\" the inventor asked. \"Whatever for,\nColonel Dower?\"\n\n\"We just want to make sure you haven't got any hidden power sources\nhooked up to that suitcase of yours. We know a place out in the Mojave\nwhere there aren't any power lines for miles. We'll pick the place.\"\n\nThe inventor frowned at him out of pale blue eyes. \"Look.\" He gestured\nat the suitcase sitting on the laboratory table. \"You can see there's\nnothing faked about that.\"\n\nColonel Dower shook his head. \"You won't tell us what's in that\nsuitcase. All we know is that it's supposed to produce power. From\nwhat? How? You won't tell us. Did you ever hear of the Keely Motor?\"\n\n\"No. What was the Keely Motor?\"\n\n\"Something along the lines of what you have here,\" the colonel said\ndryly, \"except that Keely at least had an explanation for where he was\ngetting his power. Back around 1874, a man named John Keely claimed he\nhad invented a wonderful new power source. He called it a breakthrough\nin the field of perpetual motion. An undiscovered source of power, he\nsaid, controlled by harmony. He had a machine in his lab which would\nbegin to turn a flywheel when he blew a chord on a harmonica. He could\nstop it by blowing a sour note. He claimed that this power was all\naround, but that it was easiest to get it out of water. He claimed\nthat a pint of his charged water would run a train from Philadelphia\nto New York and back and only cost a tenth as much as coal.\"\n\nThe inventor folded his arms across his chest and looked grimly at\nColonel Dower. \"I see. Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, he got some wealthy men interested. A lot of them invested\nmoney--big money--in the Keely Motor Company. Every so often, he'd\nbring them down to his lab and show them what progress he was making\nand then tell them how much more money he needed. He always got them\nto shell out, and he was living pretty high on the hog. He kept at it\nfor years. Finally, in the late nineties, _The Scientific American_\nexposed the whole hoax. Keely died, and his lab was given a thorough\ngoing over. It turned out that all his marvelous machines were run by\ncompressed air cleverly channeled through the floor and the legs of\ntables.\"\n\n\"I see,\" repeated the inventor, narrowing his eyes. \"And I suppose my\ninvention is run by compressed air?\"\n\n\"I didn't say your invention was a phony,\" Colonel Dower said\nplacatingly. \"I merely mentioned the Keely Motor to show you why we\nwant to test it out somewhere away from your laboratory. Are you\nwilling to go?\"\n\n\"Any time you are, colonel.\"\n\nA week or so later, they went out into the Mojave and set up the test.\nThe suitcase--\n\n\n\n\"... The suitcase,\" said the colonel, \"was connected up to a hundred\nhundred-watt light bulbs. He let the thing run for ten hours before he\nshut it off.\" He chuckled. \"He never would let us look into that\nsuitcase. Naturally, we wouldn't buy a pig in a poke, as the saying\ngoes. We told him that any time we could be allowed to look at his\ninvention, we'd be glad to see him again. He left in a huff, and that\nwas the last we saw of him.\"\n\n\"How do you explain,\" Thorn said carefully, \"the fact that his\nsuitcase _did_ run all those lights?\"\n\nThe colonel chuckled again. \"Hell, we had that figured out. He just\nhad a battery of some kind in the suitcase. No fancy gimmick for\nderiving power from perpetual motion or anything like that. Nope. Just\na battery, that's all.\"\n\nCaptain Dean Lacey was grinning hugely.\n\nThorn said: \"Tell me, colonel--what was this fellow's name?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't recall. Big, blond chap. Had a Swedish name--or maybe\nNorwegian. Sanderson? No. Something like that, though.\"\n\n\"Sorensen?\" Thorn asked.\n\n\"That's it! Sorensen! Do you know him?\"\n\n\"We've done business with him,\" said Thorn dryly.\n\n\"He didn't palm his phony machine off on you, did he?\" the colonel\nasked with a light laugh.\n\n\"No, no,\" Thorn said. \"Nobody sold us a battery disguised as a\nperpetual motion device. Our relations with him have been quite\nprofitable, thank you.\"\n\n\"I'd say you still ought to watch him,\" said Colonel Dower. \"Once a\ncon man, always a con man, is my belief.\"\n\nCaptain Lacey rubbed his hands together. \"Ed, tell me something.\nDidn't it ever occur to you that a battery which would do all that--a\nbattery which would hold a hundred kilowatt-hours of energy in a\nsuitcase would be worth the million he was asking for it?\"\n\nColonel Dower looked startled. \"Why ... why, no. The man was obviously\na phony. He wouldn't tell us what the power source was. He--\" Colonel\nDower stopped. Then he set his jaw and went on. \"Besides, if it were a\nbattery, why didn't he say so? A phony like that shouldn't be--\" He\nstopped again, looking at the naval officer.\n\nLacey was still grinning. \"We have discovered, Ed,\" he said in an\nalmost sweet voice, \"that Sorensen's battery will run a submarine.\"\n\n\"With all due respect to your rank and ability, captain,\" Thorn said,\n\"I have a feeling that you'd have been skeptical about any such story,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll admit that,\" Lacey said. \"But I still would have been\nimpressed by the performance.\" Then he looked thoughtful. \"But I must\nadmit that it lowers my opinion of your inventor to hear that he tells\nall these cock-and-bull stories. Why not just come out with the\ntruth?\"\n\n\"Evidently he'd learned something,\" Thorn said. \"Let me tell you what\nhappened after the contracts had been signed--\"\n\n\n\n... The contracts had been signed after a week of negotiation. Thorn\nwas, he admitted to himself, a little nervous. As soon as he had seen\nthe test out on Salt Flats, he had realized that Sorensen had\ndeveloped a battery that was worth every cent he had asked for it.\nThorn himself had pushed for the negotiations to get them through\nwithout too much friction. A million bucks was a lot of loot, but\nthere was no chance of losing it, really. As Sorensen said, the\ncontract did not call for the delivery of a specific device, it called\nfor a device that would produce specific results. If Sorensen's device\ndidn't produce those results, or if they couldn't be duplicated by\nThorn after having had the device explained to him, then the contract\nwasn't fulfilled, and the ambitious Mr. Sorensen wouldn't get any\nmillion dollars.\n\nNow the time had come to see what was inside that mysterious Little\nBlack Suitcase. Sorensen had obligingly brought the suitcase to the\nmain testing and development laboratory of North American Carbide &\nMetals.\n\nSorensen put it on the lab table, but he didn't open it right away.\n\"Now I want you to understand, Mr. Thorn,\" he began, \"that I, myself,\ndon't exactly know how this thing works. That is, I don't completely\nunderstand what's going on inside there. I've built several of them,\nand I can show you how to build them, but that doesn't mean I\nunderstand them completely.\"\n\n\"That's not unusual in battery work,\" Thorn said. \"We don't completely\nunderstand what's going on in a lot of cells. As long as the thing\nworks according to the specifications in the contract, we'll be\nsatisfied.\"\n\n\"All right. Fine. But you're going to be surprised when you see what's\nin here.\"\n\n\"I probably will. I've been expecting a surprise,\" Thorn said.\n\nWhat he got was a _real_ surprise.\n\nThere was a small pressure tank of hydrogen inside--one of the little\nones that are sometimes used to fill toy balloons. There was a small\nbatch of electronic circuitry that looked as though it might be the\ninsides of an FM-AM radio.\n\nAll of the rest of the space was taken up by batteries.\n\nAnd every single one of the cells was a familiar little cannister.\nThey were small, rechargeable nickel-cadmium cells, and every one bore\nthe trademark of North American Carbide & Metals!\n\nOne of the other men in the lab said: \"What kind of a joke is this?\"\n\n\"Do you mean, Mr. Sorensen,\" Thorn asked with controlled precision,\n\"that your million-dollar process is merely some kind of gimmickry\nwith our own batteries?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Sorensen. \"It's--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said one of the others, \"is it some kind of hydrogen\nfuel cell?\"\n\n\"In a way,\" Sorensen said. \"Yes, in a way. It isn't as efficient as\nI'd like, but it gets its power by converting hydrogen to helium.\nI need those batteries to start the thing. After it gets going, these\nleads here from the reactor cell keep the batteries charged. The--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by five different voices all trying to speak at\nonce. He could hardly--\n\n\n\n\"... He could hardly get a word in edgewise at first,\" said Thorn. He\nwas enjoying the look of shocked amazement on Colonel Dower's face.\n\"When Sorensen finally did get it explained, we still didn't know\nmuch. But we built another one, and it worked as well as the one he\nhad. And the contract didn't specifically call for a battery. He had\nus good, he did.\"\n\n\"Now wait--\" Colonel Dower said. \"You mean to say it wasn't a battery\nafter all?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"Then why all the folderol?\"\n\n\"Colonel,\" Thorn said, \"Sorensen patented that device nine years ago.\nIt only has eight years to run. But he couldn't get anyone at all to\nbelieve that it would do what he said it would do. After years of\nbeating his head against a stone wall, years of trying to convince\npeople who wouldn't even look twice at his gadget, he decided to get\nsmart.\n\n\"He began to realize that 'everybody knew' that hydrogen fusion wasn't\nthat simple. It was his _theory_ that no one would listen to. As soon\nas he told anyone that he had a hydrogen fusion device that could be\nstarted with a handful of batteries and could be packed into a\nsuitcase, he was instantly dismissed as a nut.\n\n\"I did a little investigating after he gave us the full information on\nwhat he had done. (Incidentally, he signed over the patent to us,\nwhich was more than the contract called for, in return for a job with\nour outfit, so that he could help develop the fusion device.)\n\n\"As I said, he finally got smart. If the theory was what was making\npeople give him the cold shoulder, he'd tell them nothing.\n\n\"You know the results of that, Colonel Dower. At least he got somebody\nto test the machine. He managed to get somebody to look at what it\nwould do.\n\n\"But that wasn't enough. He didn't have, apparently, any legitimate\nexcuse for keeping it under wraps that way, so everyone was\nsuspicious.\"\n\n\"But why tell _you_ it was a battery?\" asked Captain Lacey.\n\n\"That was probably suggested by Colonel Dower's reaction to the tests\nhe saw,\" Thorn said. \"Somebody--I think it was George Gamow, but I'm\nnot certain--once said that just having a theory isn't enough; the\ntheory has to make sense.\n\n\"Well, Sorensen's theory of hydrogen fusion producing electric current\ndidn't make sense. It was _true_, but it didn't make sense.\n\n\"So he came up with a theory that _did_ make sense. If everyone wanted\nto think it was 'nothing but a battery', then, by Heaven, he'd sell it\nas a battery. And _that_, gentlemen, was a theory we were perfectly\nwilling to believe. It wasn't true, but it did make sense.\n\n\"As far as I was concerned, it was perfectly natural for a man who had\ninvented a new type of battery to keep it under wraps that way.\n\n\"Naturally, after we had invested a million dollars in the thing, we\n_had_ to investigate it. It worked, and we had to find out why and\nhow.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Colonel Dower, looking somewhat uncomfortable. \"I\npresume this is all under wraps, eh? What about the Russians? Couldn't\nthey get hold of the patent papers?\"\n\n\"They could have,\" Thorn admitted, \"but they didn't. They dismissed\nhim as a crackpot, too, if they heard about him at all. Certainly they\nnever requested a copy of his patent. The patent number is now top\nsecret, of course, and if anyone does write in for a copy, the Patent\nOffice will reply that there are temporarily no copies available. And\nthe FBI will find out who is making the request.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Colonel Dower, \"at least I'm glad to hear that I was not\nthe only one who didn't believe him.\"\n\nCaptain Lacey chuckled. \"And Mr. Thorn here believed a lie.\"\n\n\"Only because it made more sense than the truth,\" Thorn said. \"And,\"\nhe added, \"you shouldn't laugh, captain. Remember, we suckered the\nNavy in almost the same way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n   *       *       *       *       *\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nErrata\n\ncould talk openly and at ease.
