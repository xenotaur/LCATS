    "body": "A telephone inspector was in the Sweeny apartment, looking over the\ninstrument. Mrs. Sweeny stood by, evidently suspicious, and watched the\nman as he worked. Sometimes telephone inspectors turned out to be\nevil-disposed persons, bent on loot. If one\u2019s back were toward them,\nthey would deftly collect whatever property happened to be available and\ndecamp. So Mrs. Sweeny gave this man no opportunity at all to develop a\nburglarious streak, but watched his every move.\n\nAt last he finished brushing out the transmitter, tapping here and there\nwith an inquisitive finger, tightening contact screws and the like, and\nwent his way. His observer, now off duty, made her way to the Boarder\u2019s\nrooms for a chat.\n\n\u201cGood mornin\u2019,\u201d she said, as she entered.\n\nHe returned the greeting and offered her a chair.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said she, seating herself. \u201cOne of them telephone fellers was\njust here, fixin\u2019 the thing. I been watchin\u2019 him. You don\u2019t find me\ntakin\u2019 chances on parties that comes around like that, bein\u2019 flat\nworkers. Not me!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s best to be careful,\u201d agreed the Boarder.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what my Danny usta tell me b\u2019fore he was shot,\u201d she continued.\n\u201cWe was on a party line then----\u201d She broke off abruptly, as if memory\nhad flashed a message. \u201cSay,\u201d she resumed, \u201cwas you ever a party liner?\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d the Boarder asked.\n\n\u201cA party liner,\u201d came the repetition. \u201cYou\u2019re one when you and three or\nfour other people all listens to what each other says on the phone,\nb\u2019cause they\u2019re on the same line and can. Anybody that would listen like\nthat would peek through a keyhole--and I never met nobody that wouldn\u2019t\nlisten. After you\u2019ve been a party liner for a while, you\u2019ve got more of\na rubberneck disposition than a\u2019 astronomer. You watch a show from\nbeginnin\u2019 to end, through op\u2019ry glasses, b\u2019cause it makes you think\nyou\u2019re peekin\u2019 at somethin\u2019 on the sly. It\u2019s a worse habit than\nwhis\u2019lin\u2019 through your teeth; but there\u2019s times when it comes in handy\nfor some folks. The fine young one I had almost put Mr. Dan Sweeny and\nwife down and out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose the telephone company got after you?\u201d the Boarder hazarded.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get no coupon with that guess.\u201d Mrs. Sweeny assured him.\n\u201cNothin\u2019 like that happened; but somethin\u2019 else did. Me and Danny seen\nour bank roll all made up and ready to go on in a disappearin\u2019 act. It\nwas a scary time for me, I tell you, mister.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe boarder left off whittling the end of a pencil and began to make\nhimself comfortable.\n\nMrs. Sweeny continued:\n\n\u201cAbout that time Danny had had a fallin\u2019 out with a feller named \u2018Mike\nthe Wop\u2019 that was workin\u2019 at one of them race-track books. My husban\u2019\nwouldn\u2019t stand for somethin\u2019 he done, and told him so. They quarreled\nsomethin\u2019 outrag\u2019ous; but afterward they made it up. Danny brought him\nout to dinner, and we treated him real stylish, like he was in the\nlegislature and willin\u2019 to be bought on the racin\u2019 question. But that\nthere Mike wasn\u2019t no kind of a man. He had a low, backbitin\u2019\ndisposition--he said he had Sicilian blood in him, and I believe it.\nThem Sicilians is great on that revenge thing, mister.\u201d\n\nThe Boarder nodded.\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d his landlady went on, \u201cI didn\u2019t trust him; and afterward I told\nDanny to watch him like he was a tack on a dark floor. I remember that\ntime at dinner that the telephone was talked about--somethin\u2019 brought it\nout--and our party line got a hearin\u2019. And Mike, bein\u2019 one of them\nfellers that alwus likes to pan out wimmin for bein\u2019 mutts and havin\u2019 no\nprinciples, says he bet I listened on the line.\n\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018bein\u2019 that I\u2019m honust by nature,\u2019 I says, \u2018I\u2019ll say\nthis much: If I happen to take down the receiver and the line\u2019s busy,\u2019 I\nsays, \u2018mebbe I don\u2019t put the thing right back up on the hook,\u2019 I says.\n\n\u201cMike laughs.\n\n\u201c\u2018Haw-haw-haw!\u2019 he says, \u2018you\u2019re like all the rest of \u2019em, Mis\u2019 Sweeny,\u2019\nhe says. \u2018Wimmin would listen on a telephone line, if what they heard\nwas that their own house was burnin\u2019 down,\u2019 he says. \u2018They\u2019d stick till\nthe folks got through talkin\u2019 and then take a chance at gettin\u2019 out\nalive,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have no argument with him, seein\u2019 that he\u2019s nothin\u2019 but\na rowdy. And then the talk turns to who\u2019s on the line with us. You know\nhow them things will come off. You bring up somethin\u2019 to talk about and\ntell all you know about it, and then begin to lie. We told Mike that a\nPresbyterian minister was the L party; and a clairvoyant was the X\nparty, and a feller named Doyle, that run a corner saloon over on\nAmsterdam Av-noo, was the R party, and we was the J party. I knew, for\nI\u2019d called up the information operator from downtown and asked. Mebbe I\nwas buttin\u2019 in, but I just had to know. At first I was goin\u2019 to kick\nabout havin\u2019 a saloon on our line, but the phone wasn\u2019t there; it was at\nthe man\u2019s house. Of course all this patter didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 much to\nMike at the time. It was just somethin\u2019 that comes off between ladies\nand gent\u2019m\u2019n. But wait! I seen the time when I wished we\u2019d never said a\nword about who was on our line. All the trouble come from that.\u201d\n\nThe Boarder was showing considerable interest.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how----\u201d he began.\n\nBut Mrs. Sweeny had the floor, and reminded him of it.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d she declared, \u201cyou don\u2019t seem like you had sense. Ain\u2019t I\ndoin\u2019 my best to tell you how?\u201d\n\nHe subsided, and she went on:\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cThat evenin\u2019 when Mike left, Danny walked to the corner saloon with him\nand interduced him to the proprietor, Doyle. This here Doyle was crazy\nabout the horses, and had more respect for Danny, who was a bookmaker,\nthan for the man that made the subway. Danny didn\u2019t stay, though, but\ncome home right away. He wasn\u2019t one of them stay-out-all-nights, except\nwhen there was somethin\u2019 special to celebrate, like makin\u2019 a big winnin\u2019\nat the track. When he come in, he says to me:\n\n\u201c\u2018Belle,\u2019 he says, \u2018Mike ain\u2019t such a bad feller.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s worse,\u2019 I says, \u2018but they\u2019re in jail. Take it from me, Danny,\nthe Wop is the kind that\u2019ll meet you with a glad face and then forget\nthat he ever looked pleasant--he\u2019s a smile-that-won\u2019t-stay-on feller,\u2019 I\nsays. \u2018I like him much,\u2019 I says; \u2018about as much as you\u2019d like doin\u2019 the\nhousework,\u2019 I says.\n\n\u201cYou see, mister, a woman\u2019s got a\u2019 instinct that\u2019s wound up all the time\nand rings up people and things like a cash register.\u201d\n\nThe Boarder was moved to comment.\n\n\u201cWoman\u2019s intuition is a strange thing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI bet on mine,\u201d she assured him, \u201cand I don\u2019t have to walk home much,\nas you might say. And when it told me the Wop\u2019s number--which was 00--I\nwas sure that the right record was playin\u2019. I tried to make Danny listen\nto it, but he was goin\u2019 to sleep in his chair and wanted peace. So we\nlet the thing drop.\n\n\u201cOne mornin\u2019 not long after that our telephone rung, and some party ast\nfor Mr. Doyle.\n\n\u201c\u2018You\u2019re in the wrong pew,\u2019 I says.\n\n\u201c\u2018Ain\u2019t this the R party?\u2019 says the feller talkin\u2019, and his voice\nsounded familiar.\n\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 I says, \u2018this is the J party.\u2019\n\n\u201cI heard him laughin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Hello, Mrs. Sweeny,\u2019 he says, \u2018rubberin\u2019 in on the line again? This is\nMike talkin\u2019.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 I says, gettin\u2019 mad. \u2018I ain\u2019t rubberin\u2019 in on the line. Our bell\nrung,\u2019 I says, \u2018and a lady\u2019s got a puffec\u2019 right to answer her telephone\nif the bell rings,\u2019 I says.\n\n\u201cHe laughs again.\n\n\u201c\u2018Correct,\u2019 he says; \u2018go to the head of the class.\u2019 Then he told me he\ndidn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 and for me not to go away mad. But I hung up, and\nthrowed a salt cellar across the room, I was so put out.\n\n\u201cAfter a while, though, the thing got to easin\u2019 up on my chest, and I\nbegun to wonder what the Wop\u2019s business with Mr. Doyle was. I knew that\nDoyle was makin\u2019 considerable money out of his place; so, puttin\u2019 two\nand two together, it looked to me that mebbe the Wop was after it. Now,\nmister, we\u2019ve brought up at the place where there\u2019s a curious woman to\ndeal with--and somethin\u2019 usually happens when one of them persons is\nturned loose, don\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe so,\u201d laughed the Boarder.\n\n\u201cYou better had,\u201d she told him. \u201cOh, don\u2019t they know human nature,\nthough!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d inquired he, not knowing where he stood.\n\n\u201cThem gamblers,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey know it better than a s\u2019ciety woman\nthinks she knows bridge. Well, let me go on with my story. The next day,\nabout the same time in the mornin\u2019, our phone rings again, and it is\nanother case of wrong number and another case of Mike. After we\u2019d rung\noff, I gets to thinkin\u2019 again: \u2018What does he want with Doyle?\u2019 And the\nnext minute I\u2019ve got the receiver down, and there I am, a peeping\nTomerino, waitin\u2019 for what\u2019s comin\u2019 off. I didn\u2019t stay in suspense.\nRight off I heard Mr. Doyle sayin\u2019:\n\n\u201c\u2018Hello!\u2019 And then come Mike\u2019s voice. They was talkin\u2019 about a winner\nthat was bein\u2019 held for a killin\u2019. Mr. Doyle was to play it on Mike\u2019s\ntip.\n\n\u201c\u2018I ain\u2019t quite sure yet,\u2019 says Mike. \u2018They\u2019re keepin\u2019 that horse\ncovered up; but I\u2019ll give you the info in time. You\u2019ll know in two or\nthree days. Then get on, and get on hard.\u2019\n\n\u201cMr. Doyle was for it, mister. And mebbe you think I ain\u2019t the curious\nlittle girl about that time! What horse was goin\u2019 to come through? If I\ncould find out and tell Danny, we\u2019d have a fine, soft place to cut loose\nin, after the horse had got home ahead of \u2019em all. The thing got me all\nexcited. I couldn\u2019t hardly wait till the next day, for I meant to listen\nin again--that telephone had took all my morals away from me, and I just\ndidn\u2019t care what happened, as long as I got that information. I didn\u2019t\neven excuse myself on the grounds that I was doin\u2019 a\u2019 underhanded thing\nfor the husban\u2019 I loved--and at that, I figgered on gettin\u2019 a swell\ndress out of the killin\u2019. This money thing, mister, is somethin\u2019 that\u2019s\nawful quick and sure in givin\u2019 wimmin a crool attack of bein\u2019 wicked.\nAin\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThe Boarder thought so.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Mrs. Sweeny went on, \u201cit took me out of the Sunday-school class\nright away. And to make the temptation all the stronger, Mike the Wop\nalwus seemed to get our number b\u2019fore he got what he wanted. You\u2019d ought\nto of heard him pan out the service! He was real worked up about them\ngirls makin\u2019 so many mistakes. But I didn\u2019t care. When the bell rung, I\nknew that them two men was goin\u2019 to talk, so I got right on the job. And\nI stuck like garlic smell on a\u2019 I-talian. I got crazy to know the name\nof that horse; and you can know how anxious I was, when I tell you that\nI almost cut out bein\u2019 company for Mrs. \u2018Big Joe\u2019 Goss----\u201d\n\n\u201cEr----\u201d the Boarder began.\n\n\u201cShe was a sick lady I was sittin\u2019 up with afternoons,\u201d Mrs. Sweeny\nhastened to explain. \u201cAnd there\u2019s more telephone stuff to her side of\nthe story. But just you wait. It\u2019ll all come out in time. Mrs. Big Joe\nwas the wife of a pool-room keeper that me and Danny knowed real well,\nand her bein\u2019 all in with neuritis, I was puttin\u2019 out a helpin\u2019 hand and\ngnawin\u2019 on the rag all afternoon, so\u2019s she wouldn\u2019t have a relapse\nthinkin\u2019 how Big Joe abused her. I\u2019d been doin\u2019 it about ten days; and\nlately I\u2019d of gave my right mitt to stick around and listen to what\nmight come over the telephone. Gee! but I was anxious to get the name of\nthat horse, mister! It was real deep anxiety, the kind that makes you\nforget hatin\u2019 people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I can appreciate your position,\u201d the Boarder assured her with\nsympathy.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a bettin\u2019 man to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever\nwalked down street in a new suit, without no umbrella, and you\u2019re dead\nsure it\u2019s goin\u2019 to rain, and it don\u2019t,-then you have went through\nsomethin\u2019 like I did about that horse. But things have a habit of comin\u2019\nto ends, and this here pony business wasn\u2019t any exception. A day or two\nlater, it all come out. My bell had rung, as usual, and when me and the\nWop had quit roastin\u2019 the telephone company to each other, I. hung up\nand waited long enough for Mike to get his number. Then I kicks in. Mr.\nDoyle took down his receiver at just about the time I did--say, I had\nthe thing timed to a second--for I heard him say:\n\n\u201c\u2018Hello!\u2019\n\n\u201cMike says \u2018Hello!\u2019 too. Then he went on;\n\n\u201c\u2018Doyle,\u2019 he says, \u2018I\u2019ve got it. They\u2019re goin\u2019 to pull it in the fourth\nrace to-morruh,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u201c\u2018What is it?\u2019 says Doyle.\n\n\u201c\u2018Whirlwind, Junior,\u2019 says Mike, \u2018and go to it, Doyle, like it was\nbeefsteak and mushrooms,\u2019 he says, \u2018and you hadn\u2019t et in a week. It\u2019s\nthe best thing that\u2019s happened since Doc Cook discovered easy money,\u2019 he\nsays. \u2018And don\u2019t let this info get away. There\u2019s twenty to one, if you\nget on early, and half that, anyway,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u201cMr. Doyle didn\u2019t take a second to answer.\n\n\u201c\u2018You\u2019re on,\u2019 he says, \u2018and I\u2019ll carry fifty for you.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Fifty?\u2019 says the Wop, in a voice that might mean anything.\n\n\u201c\u2018I mean a hundred,\u2019 says Doyle. And then they babbled along for five\nminutes about the horse, and the best pool room to put up the money in,\nand such a line of stuff. Doyle never went to the track, b\u2019cause if he\ndid he couldn\u2019t help bettin\u2019 on every race, and that alwus busted him.\u201d\n\nMrs. Sweeny paused a moment, a bit out of breath.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help rememberin\u2019,\u201d she continued, \u201chow fine I felt when I\u2019d got\nthat tip away from them men. I couldn\u2019t wait till Danny come home that\nnight. Once or twice I thought of tryin\u2019 to locate him in some of them\nBroadway bootleggeries, but I stopped to think that mebbe some one else\nmight be in on the line--some telephone girl--and spread the Whirlwind,\nJunior, stuff. You see, mister, when you\u2019re bad yourself, you find\nyourself believin\u2019 that everybody else is a crook, too. It\u2019s caused by\nwhat you tell me is the sighological moment----\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d interrupted the Boarder, \u201cit is a psychic phenomena--a brain\ncondition----\u201d\n\n\u201cPut that in storage,\u201d Mrs. Sweeny indignantly cut in. \u201cDon\u2019t you s\u2019pose\nI know what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about? Sighological moment is good enough for\nme. I heard Mrs. \u2018Gold Dollar\u2019 Cohen say that a few evenin\u2019s ago, and\nshe ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 on me. If she can use them there words, I guess\nBelle Sweeny can. They don\u2019t cost nothin\u2019 and----\u201d\n\nThe Boarder smiled.\n\n\u201cI meant no offense,\u201d he said. \u201cWon\u2019t you please go on with the story?\u201d\n\nMollified, the good lady gave her upturned nose the \u201cgoing down\u201d signal,\nand sailed forthwith into her yarn.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was fidgety as a crate of hens till Danny come\nhome. Then I told him all about what I\u2019d heard.\n\n\u201c\u2018Belle,\u2019 he says, when I\u2019d shook it out of the trap, \u2018you get a nice,\nnew dress just for this. What does that there one cost you was tellin\u2019\nme about--the grape de foy grass?\u2019 he says.\n\n\u201c\u2018Danny,\u2019 I says, \u2018it ain\u2019t grapes, it\u2019s cr\u00e9pe,\u2019 I says. But I didn\u2019t\nbother him with the rest of the name, b\u2019cause I knowed he wouldn\u2019t\nunderstand. I only mentioned somethin\u2019 like two fifty, which was nearer\nhis idea of information, and he stood for it.\n\n\u201c\u2018To-morruh,\u2019 he says, \u2018when I bring home the money,\u2019 he says, \u2018you get\nyours. I\u2019ll go to it for a thousand,\u2019 he says, \u2018and when everything\u2019s\nadded up, there ought to be enough to pay our hired girl with, anyhow,\u2019\nhe says. And with that he went to readin\u2019 his paper, after havin\u2019 asked\nwhen in--well, he wanted to know when dinner would be ready, he bein\u2019 as\nhungry as never no man was b\u2019fore. So I left him go ahead and read his\npaper, and we didn\u2019t mention the horse again till the next day.\n\n\u201cI tell you, mister, I was just about crazy to go out to the track and\nsee that Whirlwind, Junior, eat \u2019em up. I could see in my mind about how\nit would be. The horse would keep pretty well in front for a while, till\nthe jockey seen just what he had to beat, then he\u2019d give Whirlwind his\nhead, and mebbe beat him up, down the stretch. And there\u2019d be a gang of\nhowlin\u2019 maniacs, yellin\u2019 for the fav\u2019rite to make good.\n\n\u201cYou bet there\u2019d be excitement enough to satisfy a modust young thing\nlike me, and I wanted to mix up in it. Also, I wanted to set around with\na knew-it-all grin all over my face and collect my bit, me havin\u2019 gave\nDanny fifty to put down for me. Did you ever make a surething bet?\u201d she\nasked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the Boarder.\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d Mrs. Sweeny said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know the thrillin\u2019 feelin\u2019 you get,\nwaitin\u2019 for things to come across. I can\u2019t describe it to you, but it\nsure is some feelin\u2019. It begun with me as soon as Danny went out of the\nhouse, and kep\u2019 up right along. At noon, I slips over to Mrs. Big Joe\u2019s\nhouse for lunch and to stay there with her all afternoon. I couldn\u2019t go\nto no track, with her feelin\u2019 like she wanted to jump out of the window\nand spendin\u2019 her time quarrelin\u2019 with her nurse. She wouldn\u2019t row none\nwith me, b\u2019cause she kept too interested in what scandal was goin\u2019 on in\nour set.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cI guess mebbe I\u2019d been there a\u2019 hour, when the phone, that was set on a\nstand by her bed, begun to ring.\n\n\u201c\u2018I wisht,\u2019 she says, all nervous, \u2018I wisht, Belle, that some one would\nkick this thing in the eye for me. It like to drives me bugs,\u2019 she says,\nputtin\u2019 the receiver to her ear. I was siftin' close b\u2019side her, and\nwhen she says \u2018Hello!\u2019 I could hear the voice at the other end real\nplain.\n\n\u201c\u2018Is Joe there?\u2019 it says. And you can just guess that I set up and took\nnotice. That there voice belonged to Mike the Wop, and I seen, just as\nclear as anything, that Big Joe was in on the deal, too. Somethin\u2019 told\nme he was. Mrs. Big Joe said her husban\u2019 wasn\u2019t nowhere around. He was\ndown at his pool room, she was sure.\n\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 says Mike, \u2018he ain\u2019t there. I called up. Say, Mrs. Goss,\u2019 he\nsays, \u2018I wisht I knew where to find him.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What you want with him?\u2019 she says.\n\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s a bad tip loose,\u2019 he says, \u2018on Whirlwind, Junior,\u2019 he says,\n\u2018and I don\u2019t want Joe to fall for it,\u2019 he says. \u2018Nobody\u2019s supposed to\nplay it,\u2019 he says, \u2018but Sweeny. It\u2019s a plant,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u201cMrs. Big Joe looks up at me, and I\u2019m bendin\u2019 down close to the receiver\nthat was against her ear. She pulled it away a little bit, so I could\nhear better. \u2018This here\u2019s too good to be true,\u2019 she says, forgettin\u2019\nthat anything was the matter of her. Then to Mike:\n\n\u201c\u2018What\u2019s this you\u2019re sayin\u2019?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Sweeny\u2019s goin\u2019 to get his this afternoon,\u2019 Mike tells her, \u2018and I\nguess him and his rubberneckin\u2019 wife is goin\u2019 to have somethin\u2019 to study\nabout to-night,\u2019 he says. Then we heard him laugh. \u2018Ha-ha-ha!\u2019 he says,\n\u2018I bet they have their telephone tore out by the roots,\u2019 he says. \u2018And I\nbet she never rubbers again, as long as she lives.\u2019\n\n\u201cMrs. Big Joe gets awful anxious at that. \u2018What you drivin\u2019 at, Mike?\u2019\nshe says.\n\n\u201c\u2018You\u2019ll hear later on,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019m showin\u2019 Dan Sweeny that he can\u2019t\nmake a monkey of me and get away with it,\u2019 he says. \u2018And I\u2019m flatterin\u2019\nmyself today that I\u2019m clever enough to walk home alone, anyway. So Joe\nain\u2019t there? Well, I got to hunt him up. If you should happen to get him\non the phone, tell him I said not to play that Whirlwind thing. It\u2019s\ngoin\u2019 all up and down the line, and how it got loose I don\u2019t know. Tell\nhim, if you find him. Good-by.\u2019 And Mike hung up b\u2019fore we could get any\nmore out of him.\n\n\u201cMrs. Big Joe was so interested that she couldn\u2019t hardly stay in bed.\n\n\u201c\u2018Tell me, Belle,\u2019 she says, \u2018what all this here funny business means,\u2019\nshe says.\n\n\u201cI just set there and bowed my poor, whirlin\u2019 head in my hands. For I\nseen it all now. The Wop had been nursin\u2019 his grudge against Danny, and\nhe had played a slick hand. He\u2019d been callin\u2019 up our number right along,\nfiggerin\u2019 that I\u2019d rubber in and hear what was goin\u2019 on. I s\u2019pose he\nkept at it so long to be sure that I\u2019d get the phony tip. He\u2019d prob\u2019ly\nbeen listenin\u2019 for that little click you hear when somebody takes down\nanother receiver on a party-line wire, and he\u2019d found out when I was\nlistenin\u2019 that way, takin\u2019 a chance, like all them gamblers does, that\nit was me, and not somebody else. And right now he was havin\u2019 his little\ngiggle and warnin\u2019 his good fr\u2019en\u2019s off the information.\n\n\u201cIt sure had me goin\u2019, mister, and for a while I was so flustered that I\ncouldn\u2019t get my head workin\u2019 even good enough to tell Mrs. Big Joe what\nhad happened. Wasn\u2019t it a\u2019 awful thing, mister, me gettin\u2019 my husban\u2019 in\nwrong, through my sneakin\u2019 ways?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose you felt decidedly unpleasant,\u201d the Boarder said. \u201cBut what\nof Doyle? Was he being slaughtered, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looked like this to me,\u201d Mrs. Sweeny told him. \u201cWhat do you think\nthe Wop cared about Mr. Doyle? Nothin\u2019. He wasn\u2019t no fr\u2019en\u2019 of the\nWop\u2019s--just a\u2019 acquaintance--a fr\u2019en\u2019 of a man that the sneakin\u2019, lyin\u2019\nSicilian didn\u2019t like, anyway. Doyle was only a tool, that\u2019s all. Nobody\ncared what happened to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said the Boarder.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she resumed, \u201cI fin\u2019ly got settled down enough to tell Mrs. Big\nJoe the whole story. I didn\u2019t hide a bit of it. But she didn\u2019t have a\nword to say against me.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019d of did the same,\u2019 she said. \u2018A lady has got a puffec\u2019 right to\nlisten if she wants to. What do we have party lines for, if they ain\u2019t\nto listen at, when a pusson ain\u2019t got nothing else to do?\u2019 she says. And\nI thought it was real lovely in her. Some folks is too narrow-minded to\ntake her kind of a view of things.\n\n\u201cBut she was full of the idee that we ought to find Danny and make him\nrun away from that Whirlwind stuff. For the life of me, I didn\u2019t know\nwhere to telephone to, for sometimes Danny left his pardner run the book\nand stayed in town, even when he was bettin\u2019. And them times he was\nusually in a hotel room, playin\u2019 poker and such a line of work.\n\n\u201c\u2018Be-lieve me,\u2019 I said to Mrs. Big Joe, \u2018I\u2019m clean up in the air,\u2019 I\nsays, \u2018for I don\u2019t know where to look for him.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut she wanted to do somethin\u2019.\n\n\u201c\u2018Belle,\u2019 she says, \u2018call up all the live dives along Broadway, close to\nForty-second Street,\u2019 she says, \u2018and if he ain\u2019t in one of \u2019em, we\u2019ll\nget the track. Now begin.\u2019 She takes the book from the table and hands\nit to me.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cFor a while, it seemed as if the type just danced around, but soon I\nwas able to read, and then I begun to call up numbers. My only hope was\nthat, as Whirlwind, Junior, wasn\u2019t to start till the fourth race, Danny\nmight fool around with some of his pals till late, and then ride out to\nthe track in a\u2019 automobile. When I got that far in my reasonin\u2019, I kept\nrepeatin\u2019 that word, \u2018automobile, automobile, automobile.\u2019 It struck me\nlike a hunch, but it was several minutes before I knew what it meant.\nAfter that, I didn\u2019t telephone no more places. I rung up Mrs. Gold\nDollar Cohen.\n\n\u201c\u2018Say,\u2019 I says, \u2018somethin\u2019 turrible has happened,\u2019 I says, \u2018and I must\nget to Danny,\u2019 I says, \u2018b\u2019fore the fourth race. And will you lend me\nyour car for a fast ride, and your choofer?' I says. Follerin\u2019 which, I\ntold her of the mean trick that the Wop had pulled on me and Danny. Mrs.\nGold Dollar spoke right up, as soon as she seen what was happenin\u2019.\n\n\u201c\u2018Belle,\u2019 she says, \u2018you can have the French car,\u2019 she says, \u2018and,\nwhat\u2019s more, I\u2019ll go along. Where are you now?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018At Mrs. Big Joe\u2019s,\u2019 I says.\n\n\u201c\u2018Then,\u2019 she says, \u2018get trimmed up, Belle,\u2019 she says, \u2018b\u2019cause it won\u2019t\nbe more\u2019n ten minutes till I\u2019m yellin\u2019 my head off out in front of that\nthere place for you,\u2019 she says. Then we hangs up, and I\u2019m the busy party\nfor a while, gettin\u2019 fixed for the trip. Oncet I says to Mrs. Big Joe\nthat I\u2019d ought to stick around and take care of her, but she let out a\nawful holler at that.\n\n\u201c\u2018There is big things to be did this day,\u2019 says she, \u2018and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m\nable to take care of myself,\u2019 she says, \u2018for there\u2019s the nurse to bawl\nout,\u2019 she says, \u2018when I want somethin\u2019 to do. And, anyway, I want Mike\nthe Wop to understand that ladies has a puffec\u2019 right to listen at a\ntelephone. I do it myself,\u2019 she says, \u2018and I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to stand for no\ncall down from no cheap Sicilian,\u2019 she says. \u2018Our husban\u2019s ought to beat\nhim up.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Ain\u2019t that the truth!\u2019 I says, real emphatically. And then I was on my\nway, hopefuller than I\u2019d been since the Wop showed us his hand.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cMrs. Gold Dollar was waitin\u2019 for me when I got downstairs.\n\n\u201c\u2018Belle,\u2019 she says to me, \u2018wait till we get over in Brooklyn,\u2019 she says.\n\u2018I\u2019ve told my man to hit it up and make Sheepshead Bay quicker than it\nwas ever did b\u2019fore. I don\u2019t care if we do get pinched,\u2019 she says, \u2018for\nthe Gold Dollar is havin\u2019 a great season with his book, and his wife\nought to be allowed a little fun now and then,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u201cMy eyes was shut all durin\u2019 that trip, mister, so I can\u2019t tell just\nwhat happened. All I know is that them new French-make cars hits only\nevery sixteenth high spot, and even at that they touch so light that you\ncan\u2019t notice it. Mrs. Gold Dollar screamed all the way out. When she\nbegun, the choofer stopped the car, but she hollers:\n\n\u201c\u2018Ferdunund, if you do that again, I\u2019ll scream! Go on! Make them wheels\ngo round like they was paid for it. I\u2019m havin\u2019 the time of my life!\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd you can take it from me, mister, he done just that. Whee! We sure\ndid go; and it didn\u2019t seem hardly ten minutes b\u2019fore the thing stopped,\nand there we was. Both of us set right out on a hunt for Danny, and\npretty soon we found him talkin\u2019 with a couple of gents.\n\n\u201c\u2018Danny,\u2019 I says, \u2018we been bunked,\u2019 I says.\n\n\u201c\u2018Give it a name, Belle,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Wop,\u2019 I says, \u2018has handed us somethin\u2019.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Whirlwind, Junior?\u2019 says he.\n\n\u201c\u2018Yep,\u2019 says I. \u2018It\u2019s bad. He ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to win.\u2019 Then I told him the\nstory as fast as I could patter it out. When I was through, he only\nkinda laughed.\n\n\u201c\u2018Well, Belle,\u2019 he says, \u2018I\u2019m sorry you and Mrs. Gold Dollar took the\ntrouble to come way out here and tell me,\u2019 he says, \u2018for I didn\u2019t get on\nWhirlwind. They was a big tip out that he was to make a killin\u2019, and it\ndidn\u2019t look good to me. I don\u2019t never fall for them hot ones, Belle, for\nI never seen many of \u2019em get across,\u2019 he says, \u2018but thanks, just the\nsame, for the bother you and Mrs. Gold Dollar has went to on my\naccount,\u2019 he says. \u2018It makes a man think he\u2019s got fr\u2019en\u2019s.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was so surprised, mister, that I couldn\u2019t do nothin\u2019 but stare.\n\n\u201c\u2018You didn\u2019t get on?\u2019 I managed to say, after a while.\n\n\u201c\u2018Nope, I didn\u2019t,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 says I, comin\u2019 to my senses, \u2018it looks to me as if the only man\nthat gets stung is Mr. Doyle,\u2019 I says, \u2018and I guess somebody ought to\ncall him up.\u2019\n\n\u201cDanny looked at me hard when I said that. In another minute he was\nrunnin\u2019 away as hard as he could go.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m goin' to phone him,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u201cAnd five minutes afterward he was back, mister, with a grin on his face\nthat made it look like a half-opened steamer trunk.\n\n\u201c\u2018Belle,\u2019 he says, \u2018nobody has got no worries but Mike the Wop. My\nfr\u2019en\u2019 Doyle didn\u2019t make no bets,\u2019 he says, \u2018b\u2019cause he was in on the\nplant. He was stallin\u2019 for Mike; only he didn\u2019t know it was us,\u2019 he\nsays.\n\n\u201c\u2018Who was meant, then?\u2019 I says.\n\n\u201c\u2018Haw-haw-haw!\u2019 says Danny, 'who do you s\u2019pose?'\n\n\u201c\u2018The minister on the line,\u2019 says I.\n\n\u201c\u2018You lose,\u2019 says he. \u2018Doyle said that he thought they were after the\nclairvoyant!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018My sakes!\u2019 I says.\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 he says. \u2018Mike the Wop says to Doyle that the clairvoyant had\ntrimmed him some way. And Doyle didn\u2019t have no use for her, b\u2019cause his\nwife kept goin\u2019 there and spendin\u2019 money for bum information. So he got\nin on the plant, and there you are,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u201cMrs. Gold Dollar and me was so supprised that we couldn\u2019t chatter. And\nthat\u2019s some supprised for a woman. Then Mrs. Gold Dollar come to. She\ndug down in her shoppin\u2019 bag, and brought out a hundred.\n\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 she says, \u2018somebody\u2019s got to lose somethin\u2019 this day, Mr.\nSweeny,\u2019 she says. \u2018Go put this on Roller Skates for me, to show,\u2019 she\nsays.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n                             TURN THE DIALS\n\nPerhaps the next time the radio set begins to howl as if a dozen cat\nfights were mewling inside of the loud speaker, it is not static that is\ninterfering with the reception from the broadcasting station, but a\nnewspaper photograph which is being sent through the air.\n\nFor an event has occurred that has been anticipated for some time--it\nhas been found possible to send pictures for long distances by wireless.\nThough the apparatus has not been brought to that point of perfection\nwhere we can sit at home and see, cast upon a screen, moving pictures,\nthe while spoken or sung words of the performer issue from the loud\nspeaker--this development will probably come later--photographs can be\ntransferred as great a distance as across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe picture to be sent is first translated into radio impulses by\nphotoelectric cells. These radio impulses are broadcast, received on the\nother side of the ocean, where they actuate a receiving apparatus which\nreproduces the picture as a sketch in hot brown wax. The wax flows from\na fountain pen, which is operated by radio impulses. The reproduction is\na sketch in wavy lines of wax, which is deposited on the paper a little\nthicker than the ink on an engraved card.\n\nSo, the next time the loud speaker emits squeaks, howls, squeals, or\nabsolutely impossible-to-be-identified noises--don\u2019t blame it on static!\nJust turn the dials and try to get something else, for you may be\nlistening to a drawing or a photograph flying through the air in bits.\n\n\n",
