    "body": "France. Mud. A khaki-clad column of fours slogging along to the rhythm of\ntheir own muttered but heart-felt blasphemy--a common enough sight in the\nwinter of 1917-1918.\n\nBut in one particular this procession of sufferers was unique. On the\nshoulders of each performer shone bright silver bars, and their more or\nless manly chests were spanned by Sam Browne belts. A casual observer\nwould have taken them for officers. But no, on each breast was a pair of\nsilver wings, and their uniforms were of well-fitting but variously\ndesigned whipcord. The pot-bellied little person in the indecently short\nyellow serge blouse who led them was an officer; his followers were flying\nlieutenants.\n\nThey were a part of the personnel-in-training of the great American\naviation field of Issy-la-Boue, the advance guard of the ten thousand\nAmerican bombing planes which publicity agents said were going to blast\nthe Huns out of Berlin.\n\nThe column passed between two long barracks, one of which, filled to\ncapacity with double-decker bunks, yawned thru an unfinished open end.\n\n\u201cSquads right!\u201d shrilled the pot-bellied one with the captain\u2019s bars in a\nstartling tremolo. \u201cHeh!\u201d\n\nThe men behind squads-righted in a dispirited fashion and came to a halt\nin straggling lines. The squawky voice continued:\n\n\u201cI want to say that you are the most undisciplined body of men I ever saw.\nThat--er--m\u00e9l\u00e9e you staged when you were unwittingly marched\ninto--er--contact with a body of enlisted men was the most disgraceful\nexhibition on the part of officers so-called I ever saw in my life.\nI--er--want to say you are a disgrace to the service. That\u2019s all I want to\nsay. Oh, I--er--believe Lieutenant Crosby has something to say to you.\u201d\n\nFlying-Lieutenant Crosby stepped forward and cleared his throat. He was a\nborn Babbitt, a destined getter-together.\n\n\u201cMen,\u201d he began, and then hesitated. Perhaps he should have said\n\u201cofficers,\u201d but that wouldn\u2019t have sounded right either. He rushed on, \u201cI\nwant to remind you that Happy\u2019s and Sam\u2019s funeral is this afternoon. All\nflying is called off as usual. There wasn\u2019t much of a crowd out for poor\nold Bill yesterday. I know it\u2019s a long walk and all that but we want to\nget a good crowd out this afternoon. The cadets are going to try to get a\ngood crowd out for their fellow who got bumped, and we want to get a good\ncrowd out too. That\u2019s all I wanted to say.\u201d\n\nHe retired to the ranks. The fat officer shouted \u201cDismissed!\u201d Then he\nchanged his mind.\n\n\u201cAs you were. The commanding officer wanted me to announce that quarantine\nto the post is on again until the perpetrator of the outrage of stopping\nthe Paris Express has been discovered and punished. Dismissed!\u201d\n\nThe half-broken ranks scattered in the direction of their barracks. Toward\nthe one with the unfinished end went three oddly dissimilar figures. They\nwere always together, and of course some one had already thought of\ncalling them \u201cThe Three Musketeers.\u201d\n\nOne was short, dark and slim, with pathetic eyes and a dispirited\nmustache. Another was tall and lathy, with a long lugubrious countenance.\nThe third was blond and almost corpulent.\n\n\u201cI knew it, Tommy, I knew it,\u201d said the tall man. \u201cHow come you and \u2018Fat\u2019\nto pull such a stunt, anyway? Ain\u2019t such a joke now, is it? What\u2019re you\ngoing to do about it?\u201d\n\nThe three entered their barrack and sat down on a bunk near the open end,\nwell away from the crowd huddled around the stove in the middle. The\nlittle man gazed sadly before him.\n\nHis mustache drooped dolefully. Some observant person had remarked that he\ncould read Tommy by his mustache. When it was freshly waxed and pert, he\nwas just going on a party. When it was sorry and unkempt, he had just been\non one.\n\n\u201cYou know we didn\u2019t mean any harm,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that stuff the frogs put\nout about our trying to wreck the train was a dish of prunes. As if it\nwasn\u2019t bad enough to miss the truck and walk out here twelve miles from\ntown without having all this on top of it. When the quarantine for the\nitch was taken off, and Fat and I got those \u201cthirty-six hours on condition\nyou don\u2019t go to Paris\u201d passes, we got by the M. P.\u2019s at the _gare_ in\nParis all right.\n\n\u201cWe went out through the baggage-room. I wasn\u2019t in the Ambulance for\nnothing. We came back into the station the same way, and once we got on\nthe train we went right to sleep. They sure do put up a good champagne\ncocktail at Henry\u2019s, and then all those beers at the Follies!\n\n\u201cWell, when I woke up we were at a station. I looked out and the sign on\nit said Chateauroux. I knew where we were all right because I\u2019ve flown\nover the place. We\u2019d passed Issy. So I woke Fat up and pulled him off the\ntrain. There was another train standing in the station, and I asked a frog\nwhere it went to and he said it was the Paris Express. So I knew it would\ntake us back to Issy again, and we hopped on.\n\n\u201cWe got into a third class compartment with a lot of _poilus_, and they\nhad _beaucoup_ red wine, and we drank to _la belle France_, and\n_les-\u00catats-Unis_, and when I woke up again the train was just leaving a\nstation, and the sign said Issy-la-Boue. By the time I realized what it\nall meant we were going too fast to jump off, so I pulled that handle on\nthe wall, and the train stopped.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw how wrought up the frogs were, we beat it. No wonder we had\nto come over and help them win the war, if they\u2019re all as bum shots as\nthose birds were! Guess they thought we were bandits or spies or\nsomething. Well, we had to walk home to keep from being A. W. O. Loose\nfrom roll-call this morning, and never got home till four o\u2019clock. Suppose\nafter flying, I\u2019ll have to go over and \u2019fess up to Herman, or you birds\nwill never get any more passes. But I know I\u2019ll never get one if I stay\nhere for the duration of the war.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo pass ain\u2019t _nothin\u2019_ to what you\u2019ll get, boy!\u201d said \u201cLong John.\u201d \u201cShot\nat sunrise, is my bet. But I admire your self-sacrificin\u2019 spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind, we\u2019ll take our medicine, won\u2019t we, Fat? And if I don\u2019t\nmention you, maybe he won\u2019t say anything about it.\u201d\n\nFat grunted dolefully. Outside a bugle blew. The three rose to go.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me and Tommy to fly the eighteen meters,\u201d said Long John. \u201cWhere do\nyou go, Fat?\u201d\n\n\u201cMachine-gun,\u201d was the answer.\n\n\u201cHum, too bad. I heard the guy they shot there last week croaked. The\nbullet went right thru his leg, and the quack dressed the place where it\nwent in all right, but forgot to see if it came out. Gangrene set in and\nhis leg rotted off, and they had to shoot him. Now a feller your build--\nsay, it wouldn\u2019t go through at all. Just stay there and fester--\u201d\n\nBut his victim was gone.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy flew badly that morning. He was all in, his head ached and, besides,\nhe was worrying about that interview with Major Herman Krause. And then he\nhad to practise landings--nervous work at best in an unfamiliar ship.\nFinally he blew a tire and was bawled out unmercifully by the instructor.\n\nLuckily it was on his tenth and last trip, and he breathed a sigh of\nrelief when the lecture was over and he could go. He went to the barracks\nand policed up. Shave, shine, but no shampoo. There was hardly enough\nwater for drinking and shaving, and that was brought many miles in tank\nwagons. Bathing was something one went without at Issy--and felt not much\nthe worse unless the scabbies set in.\n\nOnce militarily clean, Tommy dragged himself to headquarters, entirely\nruining the new shine so painfully acquired. He entered the presence of\nthe adjutant feeling like a whipped schoolboy. He saluted and stood at\nattention.\n\n\u201cSir, Lieutenant Lang to speak to the commanding officer.\u201d\n\nThe adjutant kept on writing for about five minutes at a desk stacked with\npiles of reports. Then he looked up savagely and spoke with a slight\naccent:\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh, yes. What for?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout the Paris Express.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo right in. He\u2019s waiting.\u201d\n\nTommy went in and stood with trembling knees before the C. O. He was a\nlarge florid man with beetling brows and his manner was not encouraging.\n\n\u201cYou? Well? What about it?\u201d\n\nTommy explained as well as he could, stressing his innocence. He thought\nhis plea must have softened an executioner, but Major Krause was\nuncompromising in attitude and words.\n\n\u201cYoung man,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are a disgrace, sir! A disgrace to the United\nStates Army!\u201d Tommy thought he had heard those words before. \u201cWe have been\nhaving considerable trouble with the guard. Those cadets are the worst\ndisciplined body of men I ever saw.\u201d Again a familiar note.\n\n\u201cAs for you--you seem to have trouble keeping awake. A permanent\nassignment as commander of the guard ought to give you beneficial practise\nat it. Of course, after keeping awake all night, you will need to sleep in\nthe day-time. You are therefore relieved from flying duty. Report at guard\nmount this evening and every evening until further orders. That will do.\u201d\n\nTommy saluted and went out, his heart sinking. There were only three known\nways of getting out of Issy-la-Boue. The first was to break your neck. The\nsecond was to fly so well that you were graduated. The third was to fly so\npoorly that you were sent to Blooey for reclassification, probably as an\narmament officer. Which was generally considered the lowest form of life\nso far discovered in the air service.\n\nAll these methods were dependent on flying. Once a man was taken off\nflying duty, it took an act of Congress to get him away from the place.\n\nThe little man wended his way back to the barracks. His comrades were\nsitting on their bunks, and he poured his tale of woe into their receptive\nears. Being beyond words, they accorded him silent sympathy. Finally Fat\nspoke:\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m lucky to be out of it. Say, did you hear the news? Brock was\nwashed out on the fifteens this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat makes seven in a week,\u201d said Tommy after a pause. \u201cHow\u2019d it happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old thing. Wings came off.\u201d\n\nA bugle called. Most of the flying lieutenants went outside and, joining\nothers from near-by barracks, formed in line. A few commands, and they\nwere in one of the rivers of mud which served as roads at the field.\nPresently they were halted behind three long two-wheeled pushcarts; each\ncart bore a long box covered with an American flag. The mourners stood in\nthe mud for half an hour waiting, and then a dispirited looking band\nappeared. Its bass drum echoed _boom-boom-boom-boom-boom_, and the\nprocession started.\n\nThrough the gate of the camp it went, and out on to the main road, while\nthe drum kept up its sad, hollow sound. Yard after yard, rod after rod,\nuntil the cort\u00e8ge had walked two miles. Then it turned into a young but\nflourishing cemetery, with red, raw mounds in orderly lines.\n\nThe men were formed around three fresh graves. A pale-faced Y. M. C. A.\nman stumbled through the burial service. A red-faced Knight of Columbus\ndid likewise. A Frenchman flew over and dropped some dessicated roses.\nThen they all marched away again; only the boxes and a small burial party\nremained behind.\n\nThe band struggled with its one tune, a lively quickstep, according to\nregulations. Two old peasants drew their cart to one side of the road to\nlet them pass.\n\n\u201c_Comme ils sont trists, les \u2019tits Americains!_\u201d said the woman.\n\n\u201c_Quelle musique!_\u201d answered her spouse.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three chums went back to their bunks.\n\n\u201cDo you birds know anything about being the commander of the guard?\u201d asked\nTommy with some concern.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Fat.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d answered Long John. \u201cI was chucked out of the first training camp.\nFirst, you have to have a gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cA rifle?\u201d asked Tommy.\n\n\u201cNo, you little sap. Officers don\u2019t carry rifles, or flying lieutenants\neither. A pistol.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I ain\u2019t got a pistol.\u201d\n\n\u201cBorrow one then. Do you know the general orders?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any generals, orders or debility either.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind trying to be funny. You may find out it ain\u2019t no joke about\ngenerals. The Old Boy himself and the Silly Civilian are going to inspect\nthe post tomorrow. I saw the orders over at the operations office for\nevery machine to be up that can get off the ground. I suppose that means a\nlot more long walks. But it\u2019s most time for guard mount; you\u2019d better run\nalong and find a gun.\u201d\n\nTommy disappeared and finally returned with a regulation web belt and\nholster in one hand, and a .25 caliber automatic in the other.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with that popgun, you idiot?\u201d asked Long John\ndisgustedly. \u201cAre you going hunting canary birds, or what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t find a regular gun, and a cadet loaned me this. He said\nofficers had taken it before and put a dirty sock or something in the\nholster so the butt would just show, and got by all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, then, take one of Fat\u2019s socks. The smell may keep you awake.\nIs the blamed thing loaded? Look out you don\u2019t shoot yourself. There\u2019s the\ncall, now. Put on your belt. You fool! How many belts are you going to\nwear? What do you think you are, a past grand master of the Holy Jumpers?\nTake off your Sam Browne. There--get going, now.\n\n\u201cWell, away he goes, and he doesn\u2019t know whether Julius Cesar was stabbed\nor shot off horseback. Did you ever see the like, Fat? But I bet he comes\nout all right some way, the lucky little stiff. I never knew it to fail.\nWell, let\u2019s go up by the stove.\u201d\n\nBut Tommy wasn\u2019t such a complete fool as he appeared. He knew the old Army\nadvice for shavetails, \u201cFind a good sergeant and stick to him.\u201d The\nsergeant of the guard was a grizzled old sufferer who had been through it\nall many, many times. He engineered the guard mount and posted the guard.\nThen Tommy drew him to one side.\n\n\u201cWhat do I do now, Sergeant?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWell, the lieutenant has to inspect the guard three times, once between\nmidnight and six o\u2019clock in the morning. First ask them for their special\norders, and then for their general orders. If they make a mistake, I\u2019ll\nnudge you and you say, \u2018Correct him, Sergeant,\u2019 and I\u2019ll fix him up. It\u2019s\ngetting dark now. Would the Lieutenant like to make his first inspection\nbefore supper?\u201d\n\nInspection was a hectic affair. The guard was composed of cadets who had\njoined the Army to fly and remained in it to mount guard, and it was their\nintention to make it as interesting as possible for all concerned,\nespecially their superiors. But the old sergeant was equal to the\noccasion. He steered Tommy by the traps planted for him, and then showed\nhim the guardhouse.\n\nThere the commander of the guard ate his slum and then returned to his\nbarrack. Long John grabbed him by the arm as he entered.\n\n\u201cThat frog was around again today, and he brought a lot of stuff,\u201d he\nwhispered. \u201cYou\u2019re in on it. Doc is goin\u2019 to make punch. Be around at nine\no\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy was there at the appointed time. At the far end a crowd was\ngathered. Men were perched as closely as possible on the double-deck\nbunks. In their midst Bacchanalian rites were in progress. \u201cDoc,\u201d a stout\nman with a red, satyr-like countenance, was beating a huge bowl of eggs.\nBefore him within easy reach and frequently applied, was an assorted row\nof bottles. Tommy read some of the labels--Cherry Brandy, Martell, D. O.\nM., Absinthe.\n\n\u201cMy God,\u201d he muttered to himself, \u201ceverything but nitroglycerine.\u201d\n\nThe party was undoubtedly a success. There were songs and dances and\nstories. Finally it got to the speechmaking stage. An interruption in the\nform of a volley of shots was welcome to every one except the current\nperformer. A trampling of feet, and then more shots followed. A voice at\nthe other end of the barrack shouted \u201cAttention!\u201d as Major Krause stumbled\nin. He had evidently been running, but he tried to stalk around in a\ndignified manner. Somebody whispered--\n\n\u201cThose damn cadets have been shooting off their guns and raising hell\nagain, and he\u2019s been trying to catch them.\u201d\n\nThe major approached the end of the barrack where the party had been in\nprogress. He sniffed suspiciously, but the punch-bowl had been shoved\nunder a bunk and the bottles into boots, and there was no evidence in\nsight. Finally he asked--\n\n\u201cAre there any guns in this barrack?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tommy spoke up. \u201cI know, because I was trying to borrow one this\nafternoon to mount guard with.\u201d\n\nA partially suppressed titter rose and fell again. The C. O. wheeled\naround furiously.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s you again, is it?\u201d he thundered. \u201cCarousing in here while your\nsuperiors attend to your duties. Get out to your guard and put a stop to\nthat indiscriminate shooting. I swear if I see you again tonight I\u2019ll\nprefer charges and have you broke!\u201d\n\nTommy stumbled out into the darkness and headed in what he thought was the\ndirection of the guardhouse. His head was buzzing painfully. A volley of\nshots sounded somewhere in front of him. He felt vaguely that he ought to\ndo something about it, and ran in that direction, only to fall over the\nguy-rope of a hangar and fall heavily. More shots behind him. He got up\nand staggered on. Suddenly there was a flash and a report right before\nhim. Then a voice yelled--\n\n\u201cHalt.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommander of the guard,\u201d bawled Tommy.\n\nA dark figure loomed up vaguely in the murk. He struck a match and saw a\ngrinning cadet working the bolt of his rifle and waving the muzzle around\ndangerously. Suddenly it exploded and Tommy felt mud splatter over him.\n\n\u201cI thought I saw something moving and halted it, and it wouldn\u2019t halt, so\nI fired, but I don\u2019t understand this gun very well, sir,\u201d said the cadet,\nstill working at the bolt.\n\nThe commander of the guard turned and fled. He was getting dizzier every\nminute. Finally he tripped over another guy-rope and fell, to rise no\nmore.\n\nWhen he woke, it was with the consciousness of having been annoyed for a\nlong time by a rasping noise which was still going on. He tried to pull\nhimself together and think. He could vaguely discern the bulk of a hangar.\nThere was a queer, unexplained rasping. Filed wires--Wings coming\noff--Funerals--\n\nThe noise stopped, and presently a dark figure crept out through the\nhangar door and started to steal away. Tommy drew the little automatic\nfrom its holster and fired. The next thing he realized was that there were\nflashlights and men everywhere. The sergeant of the guard. Major Krause.\nCalls for explanation. Tommy tried to explain. A voice said--\n\n\u201cYou fool, you\u2019ve shot the adjutant!\u201d Strong hands seized him and hustled\nhim away.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext morning, when a detail came to the guardhouse, Tommy was still in a\ndaze. The leader told him to police up, as he was to go before the C. O.\nHe was still confused when he was led into the office at headquarters.\n\nThe commanding officer was there, and Captain La Croix, the French officer\nwho advised as to instruction. Also a large, fierce man with stars on his\nshoulders, and a little civilian with glasses and a trench coat several\nsizes too large for him. Tommy\u2019s legs seemed to be made of butter.\n\nMajor Krause was speaking, and strange to say, his voice was not unkind.\n\n\u201cLieutenant Lang,\u201d he said, \u201cI revoke everything I said yesterday. You\nhave done a great service for your country. I regret to say that a small\nfile was found on the body of the adjutant, and that some of the ships\nwere found to have been tampered with--so skillfully that detection was\nvery unlikely. Inspection of the adjutant\u2019s papers brought out evidence\nthat he was an Austrian citizen. Tell the general and the secretary how\nyou came to discover what was going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d blurted Tommy, \u201cit was this way. I was dizzy and fell down two or\nthree times and finally I decided to go to sleep. Then some guy kept\nmaking a filing noise and waking me up, so I shot him.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat evening three flying lieutenants were finishing an illicit meal of\nchicken and champagne at a little French inn about three miles from the\nfield, and the smallest of the trio was finishing a story.\n\n\u201cThere was a long argument,\u201d he said, \u201cand the general and the major were\nall for preferring charges, but Captain La Croix stood up for me and said\nI was a good pilot, and finally they agreed to let him get me transferred\nto a French observation squadron at the front.\u201d\n\nThe tall man and the fat one looked at each other and at their little\ncompanion. Then they ejaculated as one--\n\n\u201cYou lucky little stiff!\u201d\n\n                                 THE END\n\n\n",
