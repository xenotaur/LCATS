    "body": "\"What,\" she demanded, sitting bolt upright in the hospital bed, \"has\nhappened to the medical world? In Italy, they tell me I have an\nabdominal tumor. In Paris, it's cancer. And now you fat-heads are\ntrying to tell me I'm pregnant!\"\n\nI stuffed my stethoscope into my jacket pocket and tried to pat her\nhand. \"Take it easy, Mrs. Caffey--\"\n\n\"It's _Miss Caffey_, damn you,\" she said snatching her hand away, \"and\nbetter I should have gone to an astrologer!\"\n\n\"See here, now,\" I said, letting a stern note enter my voice. \"You\ncame here requesting a verification of the malignancy of this\ngrowth. Our discovery of a six month foetus is a fact, not an\naccusation.\"\n\n\"Look, Buster, I'm a thirty-six-year-old spinster. Like the joke goes,\nI haven't been married _or anything_. Also, I knew about the birds and\nthe bees before you were emptying bedpans. Now will you get off this\nsubject of babies and find out whether it's safe for me to start any\ncontinued stories?\"\n\n\n\nSuch protestations from unmarried mothers were not uncommon, but Sara\nCaffey's cold convictions were unshakable. She sank back into her\nseven satin pillows and sighed mightily. Her wide-spaced, intelligent\neyes glared at me from a handsome, if somewhat overly strong, face.\nCreamy white shoulders swept gracefully into gradually darkening neck\nskin and frankly tanned cheeks and broad forehead. Her straight,\nslender nose was sunburned.\n\nAs resident physician for over fifteen years, I had learned patience\nin these matters. But the thought that this lovely creature expected\nme to believe that she was an unfulfilled old maid got under my skin,\nparticularly under the circumstances.\n\n\"Miss Caffey, I am a physician, not a philosopher. Just the same,\npermit me to congratulate you on your virginity.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" she said, in a voice not untinged with pride.\n\n\"However,\" I went on, \"in spite of certain contra-indications and\nirregularities of symptoms such as the absence of morning sickness and\nthe like, I would like to enlist your cooperation in delivering\nyourself of an infant within the next three months.\"\n\n\"Dr. Foley, please understand!\" She threw her hands apart in despair.\n\"I love children. I would have an acre of them if I were married, or\neven in the mood for any other alliance. But men just don't fit my\nframe of reference. And regardless of what kind of a damned fool I may\nmake of myself in the future, I haven't, to date! Doctor, the kind of\ncooperation you ask for hasn't been known for two thousand years.\"\n\nI tried another tack. \"Well, since you arrived without a medical\nhistory on your condition, would you tell us the name of your last\ndoctor so we may write for a transcript?\"\n\n\"Phillipe Sansome, in Paris.\"\n\n\"The surgeon?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"And don't try to explain that he misdiagnosed because\nhe's hungry for surgical fees. He didn't plan to operate. In fact,\nthat's why I left. He was trying some new cure of his own that didn't\nset well with the staff there, and they got into such a squabble I\nfigured I'd better remove the cause of it all before the dear old man\nlost his license.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking, I casually drew back the covers and exposed\nher slightly swollen abdomen. It, too, had a surprising coat of tan. I\ndonned my stethoscope, moved the diaphragm around until I had what I\nwanted, and held it there.\n\n\"Yes, I know of Dr. Sansome,\" I told her. \"We shall send a wire at\nonce for your case record. Helps, you know. Now, if you will just slip\nthese into your ears--\"\n\nShe let me hang the stethoscope around her neck, and even brushed back\nher shining black hair so I could adjust the ear-pieces for her.\n\n\"If Doctor Sansome had heard that,\" I said, \"he would have changed his\nmind.\"\n\nShe listened intently to the quick, light, foetal heartbeat for over a\nminute, and gradually a faraway gleam lighted her eyes. \"Oh if you\nwere only right,\" she said softly, \"Here I've chased stories all over\nthe globe half my life, and I'd have the biggest story since the flood\nright here in my own tummy!\"\n\nShe lay back again. \"But of course, you're wrong.\"\n\n\"Then what do you call the sounds you've just heard?\" I said in\ncomplete exasperation.\n\n\"Gut rumble,\" she said. \"Now go along like a nice intern and find me a\npassel of surgeons and let's have at this tumor, cancer, bubble-gum or\nwhat have you. I want out of here, fast as I can mend.\"\n\n\n\nThere was no reason to keep the female news-correspondent in bed, but\nshe wouldn't stir. She was confident that Phillipe Sansome's findings\nwould convince us. Three days passed with no word from Paris. Then, on\nthe fourth day, her medical history arrived in the briefcase of the\nfamous surgeon himself.\n\n\"I flew,\" he apologized, \"but it took two days to detach myself.\nDelighted to meet you, Dr. Foley. Your cable mentioned a Miss Sara\nCaffey, maternity patient. Is it _possible_?\"\n\nHe was large for a Frenchman, and his gauntness was compounded by an\nobvious lack of sleep. His black eyes bore into mine as if to drag out\nwhat appeared to me to be a fairly mundane admission.\n\n\"We call her that,\" I said shrugging. \"And as to her condition, you\nmay examine her yourself.\"\n\n\"_Sacre bleu!_\" His eyes rolled up like bloodshot cue-balls. \"She\nleft us at her own insistence. Aside from ethics, we must not disturb\nher by my reappearance. But I have a favor to ask. A giant mountain of\na fantastic favor. Now that I have found her again, I must not lose\nher, certainly not, until--\"\n\nHe grabbed pen and paper and moved his chair to my desk. He wrote\nbriefly. \"_Voila!_ These simple adjustments in her metabolism--diet,\nand just a few so petite injections. And may I remain here in the\nbehind-ground, incognito? I will help with other work--at no cost, of\ncourse. I will be an orderly, if you will. But I must remain in touch.\nClose touch.\"\n\nI was a bit nonplussed. A man of Sansome's reputation! It was like a\nUnited States Senator pleading for the opportunity to scrub out the\nmen's room at the House of Representatives. Just the same, I wouldn't\nbe stampeded or overawed. Several provocative explanations for the\nFrench doctor's concern came to mind.... Was he the repudiated father\nof Sara's unborn child? Or was he a practitioner of artificial\ninsemination, with a rather unfortunate error to his credit?\n\n\"Your request is unusual,\" I said cautiously, \"but not entirely\nunreasonable. In order to justify it, I am sure you will be willing to\nexplain your interest in this case, will you not, Doctor?\"\n\n\n\nHe frowned, \"I suppose I must. But you will believe little of it. My\nown staff agreed with my diagnosis, but they violently rejected my\ntheory. Wait until they hear _your_ diagnosis, doctor!\" He unzipped\nhis briefcase. \"She probably protests that she has a malignant tumor,\nnot a baby,\" he remarked as he laid thick sheafs of paper on my desk.\n\n\"You are so very right,\" I said.\n\n\"Madamoiselle is magnificent,\" he observed, running slender, wrinkled\nhands through his sparse gray hair. \"But her obstinacy will not avail\nagainst evolution. No more than we doctors' monumental ignorance.\"\n\n\"Evolution? Explain, please.\"\n\n\"Here is the case history.\" He drummed on it with his short-clipped\nnails. \"In it, you will find that Caffey came to us three months ago\nwith her body cavity in the grasp of a small octopus of a soft form\ncarcinoma. The pain reached from pelvis to chest.\"\n\n\"Incredible!\" I exclaimed.\n\nSansome spread his hand on the record sheets. \"Facts are never\nincredible,\" he reminded me gently. \"What follows, however, will tax\nyour credulity, and I beg of you to allow me to impose an outrageous\nconcept whose only virtue appears to be its demonstrated validity.\"\n\n\"Proceed.\"\n\n\"In forty years of slicing away tumerous growths, I had become morbid\nat the dreadful incidence of recurrence and the obscene mortality\nrate. In spite of all our techniques, these cancers have increased\nwith the persistence of Nature herself.\n\n\"In a fit of prolonged depression brought on by a foolishly strenuous\nresearch of histories, my mind stumbled into a stupid preoccupation\nwith a few isolated cases of exogenic pregnancy. One which fascinated\nme was the young 17-year-old boy from whose lung a surgeon removed a\nlive three-month foetus. Somehow the obvious explanation refused to\nsatisfy me. It was, of course, concluded that the foetus was an\nundeveloped twin to the boy himself.\n\n\"This _could_ be so; but on what facts was this assumption based?\nNone. Only the absence of any other theory justified the concept. The\nsurgeon had expected to find a hard carcinoma.\n\n\"And it came to me suddenly that _he had found his cancer_!\n\n\"My interpolation was this: Mankind is suffering an evolutionary\nchange in his reproductive procedure. The high incidence of various\ntumors evidences Nature's experiments in developing a asexual\nreproduction.\"\n\n\n\nSansome's statement so flabbergasted me that I looked at him for signs\nof facetiousness or irrationality. His extreme fatigue was\nevident--but his calmness and clarity of self-expression in a foreign\nlanguage indicated no mental confusion. A hoax of such magnitude was\noutside the realm of possibility for a surgeon of his distinction.\n\nThe man was simply following a blind alley of reasoning, set off by\nhis life-long frustration of battling cancer.\n\nI mustered my patience and drew him out, hoping he would find a\ncontradiction in his own theory.\n\n\"This is a rather staggering notion, Dr. Sansome,\" I said. \"Have you\nbeen able to support it with--additional evidence?\"\n\n\"Until Miss Caffey,\" he said, \"frankly, no. Not the kind of evidence\nthat is acceptable. But the theory has much to defend it. In your own\nJournal of the A. M. A., May 7, 1932, Dr. Maud Slye published the\nfirst solid evidence that predisposition to so-called malignant tumor\nis hereditary. Is this not a better characteristic of a true mutation,\nrather than of a disease?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said. \"But how does Mother Nature justify the\ndesirability of a change from our present rather successful bisexual\nsystem? And isn't she being rather cruel in her methods? Think of the\nmillions she has made suffer in her experiments.\"\n\n\"Mother Nature,\" Sansome pronounced positively, \"is neither kind nor\ncruel. She is manifestly indifferent to all but the goal of survival\nof the species. Our civilization has set out to thwart her with\nincreasingly more effective methods of birth-control. In the light of\nsurvival, Nature is most justified in trying to bring millions of\nfrustrated, childless humans to parenthood.\n\n\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" he said, riffling the case history of Sara Caffey, \"let\nus examine the evidence at hand. Our patient arrived in Paris\npositively cancerous. After confirming the diagnosis, I proposed an\nunprecedented treatment based on my theory. We know several body\nconditions which promote the rapid development of carcinoma, such as\nexcess alkalinity and high blood sugar content and so forth. Instead\nof trying to reduce these and fight the tumor, I reversed the\ntreatment and aided Miss Caffey's body to support and encourage its\ngrowth to what I predicted would be a new maturity.\n\n\"And what happened?\" He threw up his hands. \"In two months, the\ntendrils of the octopus withdrew into the central body of the tumor.\nThe tendency to spread in search for attenuated nourishment was\nreversed with the treatment. This alone was an accomplishment, for it\nwould have made the growth operable in a short time.\n\n\"Unfortunately, word of my unorthodox prescription reached a jealous\ncolleague, and he set off such a quarrel at the Institute that Miss\nCaffey packed up and left with the generous misconception that she was\nsaving me from embarrassment. I had no opportunity to assure her that\nthe Cancer Institute would decide ultimately in my favor--which it\nshall when I return with a photostat of a certain birth certificate.\"\n\nHe smiled for the first time, and his charm was so powerful that I\nsincerely wanted to believe in him. I could see no use in denying him\nhis request, for his prescriptions were of an innocuous nature for a\nnormally pregnant woman such as Sara Caffey. I trusted that a normal\nbirth of a typical baby would finally dissuade him.\n\nI extended my hand again. \"You are most welcome to stay with us,\ndoctor,\" I told him. \"The treatment you desire is within reason, and I\nadmire your tenacity with your theory. I hope you will forgive me,\nhowever, if I say that I find your premises rather tenuous. I feel\nthat we will witness a very normal birth, and ultimately Miss Caffey\nwill find it to her peace of mind to confess a secret marriage, or, at\nmost--an alliance of which she may be pathologically ashamed at the\nmoment.\"\n\nSansome grasped my hand with enthusiasm. \"_Bien! Tres bien!_\" he\nexclaimed. \"This is more generous even than I expected. Certainly I do\nnot expect a scientist of your station to swallow my theory at a gulp,\nDr. Foley. I will admit that my persistence depends more than it\nshould on intuition. But we shall see. I am grateful to you.\" And he\nkissed me firmly on each cheek.\n\n\n\nA study of Sansome's carefully prepared case history on Sara Caffey\ndid disturb me a little. I ordered a thorough reexamination, and was\nleft with some puzzling conclusions at the apparent absence of\ntumorous growth, malignant or otherwise.\n\nSara was enduring most of the classic symptoms of typical pregnancy,\nand was enjoying Dr. Sansome's treatment hugely. She guzzled the\nalkaline-producing fruit juices, fortified with carefully rationed\ndribbles of gin. She nibbled contentedly at the sweets which the\nFrenchman supplied anonymously. And she raised merry hell because we\nrefused to operate.\n\nAfter two weeks, she threatened to leave. I was paged over the P. A.\nand got to her room in time to catch her trying to zip up her skirt.\n\nShe looked at me impatiently, and then back to her abdomen. \"Damned\nthing's getting out of hand.\"\n\nShe had on an expensive tweed suit, and the smart, powder-blue\ncashmere coat I helped her into made her look her role of\ndistinguished world traveler, syndicated columnist and woman of parts.\n\nShe hunched her shoulders forward slightly, so the loose folds of the\ncoat concealed her protruding middle.\n\n\"Thanks,\" she said casually. \"I'll write you a check and be on my\nway.\"\n\n\"Dr. Sansome will be disappointed,\" I said casually.\n\n\"You heard from him?\" she asked with interest.\n\nI nodded.\n\nShe put her hands on her hips. \"And you still persist with your\nfatuous idea that I'm going to have a baby?\"\n\n\"Let us say,\" I evaded, \"that we have adopted Dr. Sansome's treatment\non a wait-and-see basis. You said yourself that he refused to operate.\nWe have definitely confirmed that much. Your condition is still\ninoperable, but you are coming along fine.\"\n\n\"Well, now, why didn't you tell me that before.\" She threw off her\ncoat and relieved the pressure of her waist zipper with a grateful\nsigh. \"Now you're making sense. Send out for another Spillane. I'll go\nalong with that. But no more of this drivel about transferring me to\nthe maternity ward, see?\"\n\n\n\nTen nights later, she changed her mind. I passed her room after a late\nemergency case. The door was open and I heard her crying softly to\nherself. I stopped in. Her bed lamp was on, and for a change she\nlooked all woman.\n\nI felt her pulse and asked, \"What's the matter, Sara?\"\n\n\"I'm going to have a baby!\" she sobbed. \"I've been feeling something\npeculiar for some time. But tonight it kicked the hell out of me.\"\n\n\"Want to talk about it?\" I asked, still holding her wrist.\n\nShe looked at me with genuine bafflement in her eyes. Her face was\npuckered up like a hurt child's. \"But it's so impossible, doctor. I'm\nsorry I talked to you the way I have, but so help me, I'm a good\ngirl.\"\n\nI almost said, _Well, these things happen_, but that would have\nsounded pretty silly. It was evident that she still wouldn't admit\neven to herself how and when it had happened.\n\n\"Ever go on a good binge?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Not since I was sixteen,\" she exclaimed. \"But I could use one right\nnow. No, that might hurt the baby.\" She folded her arms protectively\naround her middle. \"I don't get it. I don't get it at all. But if\nthat's the way it is--\" A crooked, pleased smile wrinkled tears from\nher cheeks. \"Leave it to Sary to do things the unusual way.\"\n\nShe looked up at me. \"Did you know I was the first white woman to\ninterview a Rajah's harem eunuch?\"\n\n\"Looks like you have a real story this time,\" I said, playing along\nwith her.\n\n\"Yeah. But who in hell will write it?\"\n\n\n\nPhillipe Sansome made himself eminently useful. He assisted in surgery\nevery morning, refusing fees and pleading with everyone to maintain\nhis anonymity. The staff was in on the conspiracy, and the nurses\nsmiled indulgently at him behind his back. But Sansome was too great a\nman to ridicule. The general feeling was the same as mine. He was\nolder than he thought, not in body, but in over-tired nerves and\nexhausted mind. None contested his skill with the scalpel; but none\ngave ten cents worth of credence to his twist on the theory of\nevolution.\n\nAs Sara's confinement proceeded with precise conformity to my\nexpectations, I thought Sansome would lose heart--but he didn't. He\narranged to be present in the delivery room with as much interest as\nif we expected a breach birth of a two-headed panda.\n\nI was unfortunately called to Baltimore at the last minute. I flew\nboth ways, but my haste was in vain. Sara gave birth while I was still\naloft.\n\nI checked in with more excitement than I'd thought possible. I asked\nat the desk, \"How's Caffey?\"\n\n\"Fine. Gave birth an hour ago. Beautiful little girl--\"\n\nI didn't wait for more. I dashed upstairs to the maternity ward, where\nSara had finally consented to be moved, and slipped into her room.\n\nShe was tired, but conscious. She smiled at me peculiarly.\n\n\"So it's a girl!\" I exclaimed. \"Wait until I see Sansome. A beautiful,\nhealthy, normal baby!\"\n\nA hand tapped me softly on the shoulder, and I turned to look into\nSansome's triumphant eyes.\n\n\"Without a navel,\" he said.\n\n                                                          --WINSTON MARKS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
