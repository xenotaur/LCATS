    "body": "Me and Dirty Shirt Jones prods our three burros across the border of\nYaller Rock County, points north through the country where God dumped\nthe leavings after He made the Bad Lands, and has visions of the old\nhome town.\n\nMe and Dirty has abandoned the idea of finding gold where she ain\u2019t,\nand right now we\u2019re herding our sore-footed jassacks towards the\nflesh-pots of Piperock town.\n\nWe\u2019re cutting around the side of a hill, when all to once we discerns\nthe figure of a man setting on a rock ahead of us.\n\nHe looks a heap like he was figuring out the why and whatfor of all\nthings. He humps there in the sun, a long, lean, pathetic-looking\nfigure, despondency showing even in the curves of his cartridge-belt.\nI feels sorry for him long before our lead burro halts before him and\nlets us arrive.\n\nThe figure raises its head, peers at that gray burro, and when we stop\nhe gets to his feet, turns to us and snaps:\n\n\u201cHold up your hands! Both of you!\u201d\n\nMe and Dirty jerks our hands above our heads, and this fretful-looking\nhombre with the good-by forever mustache and weary eyes squints at us\nand says\u2014\n\n\u201cYou both solemnly swear to uphold the law vested in you as deputy\nsheriffs of Yaller Rock County, so help you Gawd?\u201d\n\nMe and Dirty nods and puts down our hands.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d says Magpie Simpkins, sheriff of Yaller Rock County, \u201cI feel a\ndanged sight better.\u201d\n\nWe nods again, sets down beside him, and rolls smokes. After while\nMagpie scratches his nose and pinches out the light of his cigaret.\n\n\u201cWhat you doing here\u2014hunting snakes?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\nMagpie shakes his head and digs into the dirt with his heels.\n\n\u201cOf course it ain\u2019t none of our business,\u201d says I, \u201cbut I would like\nto know why you inoculates us with sheriffitis without warning.\u201d\n\n\u201cSheep,\u201d says he, soft-like. \u201cJust sheep, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich there never was nor never will be,\u201d states Dirty. \u201cYou mean\njust plain sheep, don\u2019t you, Magpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is as may be, Dirty.\u201d\n\nMagpie fingers his mustache, and nods.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201cme and Dirty hankers for home, so I reckon we might\nas well drift along, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says he, sad-like. \u201cYou ain\u2019t going no place, Ike. You\u2019re\narrived. Do you reckon I deputized you for fun?\u201d\n\n\u201cSheep,\u201d pronounces Dirty, \u201cdon\u2019t mean nothing at all to me. I sure am\ncontemptuous of all things pertaining to wool.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, I votes against anything that blats,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love \u2019em!\u201d snaps Magpie. \u201cDon\u2019t see me packing no sheep-dip\nto alleviate their sufferings, do you?\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t seem to, so we all sets there, humped over in the sun. After\nwhile Magpie clears his throat.\n\n\u201c\u2018Alphabetical\u2019 Allen and \u2018Scenery\u2019 Sims own three thousand woollies,\u201d\nsays he. \u201cScenery was a silent pardner, being as he\u2019s a cow-man, which\nhates sheep. Alphy gets Scenery to unhook a thousand dollars to buy\nsome fancy stock. _Sabe?_ Well, Alphy bought \u2019em\u2014red, white and blue\nones, in stacks, the same of which ain\u2019t productive none to speak\nabout.\n\n\u201cScenery chides Alphy to the extent that Alphy gets disgruntled and\nwishes to separate the herd, fifty-fifty, without considering the\nthousand he lost over the green cloth. Alphy contends that him and\nScenery has agreed to suffer gains and losses together, and\nfurthermore that he lost a lot of his own money at the same sitting,\nthe same of which makes them feller sufferers.\n\n\u201cSuch a open declaration causes some smoke and a little noise in\nPiperock, but neither of them gets shot up enough for us to declare a\nholiday. Scenery plasters a attachment on the herd, and then Alphy\nlimps to Judge Steele\u2019s wickiup and prays for a receiver.\n\n\u201cBeing as I\u2019m the sheriff I has to serve said attachment, and also\nbeing as I\u2019m a danged fool I\u2019m appointed as the receiver. The county\ndidn\u2019t elect me to herd sheep, gents. Over on the other side of that\nhill is the sheep. Somewhere over there is the tent. All very simple.\u201d\n\nMagpie fusses with his mustache for a moment and then gets to his\nfeet. He slaps our lead burro with his hat, and hitches up his belt.\n\n\u201cCome on, mules! Hump yourselves!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere to, feller?\u201d asks Dirty. \u201cThem is our burros, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t need \u2019em,\u201d says he, weary-like, \u201cso I\u2019ll take \u2019em home for\nyou. All I ask is this: Take care of the sheep.\u201d\n\n\u201cSheep?\u201d I yells.\n\n\u201cS-h-e-e-p,\u201d he spells, counting the letters on the fingers of his\nleft hand with the barrel of the gun in his right. \u201cJust sheep, Ike.\nKeep\u2014your\u2014hands\u2014off\u2014that\u2014gun!\u201d\n\n\u201cYea-a-a-a-a-h!\u201d blats Dirty, excited-like. \u201cExplain yourself,\nfeller.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Magpie points at Dirty\u2014 \u201care the receiver. _Sabe?_ I hereby\nmakes you deputy receiver of them sheep, and I honors Ike by making\nhim deputy attacher. Ike always was attached to sheep. May the Lord\nhave a little mercy on your souls, and\u2014don\u2019t lose any sheep. Come on,\ncanaries.\u201d\n\nMe and Dirty sets there like a pair of mummies and watches that\nforlorn-looking hombre herd our long-eared rolling-stock across the\nhills. Dirty jerks a rock at a sand-lizard, and yanks his hat down\nover his ears. We glares at each other for a moment.\n\n\u201cShepherd!\u201d hisses Dirty. \u201cYou sheep-attacher!\u201d\n\n\u201cDitto!\u201d I hisses back at him. \u201cYou sheep-receptacle!\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf there ever was an age when jackrabbits spoke with tin-whistle\nvoices Scenery Sims was a throwback to that period. Him and\nAlphabetical Allen are two things, the same of which the dictionary\ndesignates as inanimate objects. If you can imagine a pair of ciphers\nwith the rims rubbed out\u2014you\u2019ve got my opinion of them two _hombres_\nto a gnat\u2019s eyebrow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill Magpie Simpkins some day,\u201d says Dirty, mean-like.\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d says I. \u201cThat sounds like you, Dirty. You\u2019re always going to\nkill somebody the day after. You think too slow.\u201d We sets there a\nwhile longer, and then Dirty yawns.\n\n\u201cMight as well find \u2019em, I reckon. You attach \u2019em and I\u2019ll do the\nreceiving, Ike.\u201d We pokes over the ridge, and after going about a mile\nwe hears the voices of lamblets, and then we sees the teepee, which we\ndeciphers to be the sheep-camp. In her callow youth she might have\nbeen a tent, but the wear and tear of sheeping existence has put her\nin the sere and yaller leaf, with a touch of color, where somebody\u2019s\nred-flannel shirt has patched up a hole in one side.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cshe ain\u2019t much, but it\u2019s home, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is ever so humble,\u201d I agrees, and we slid down to it.\n\nAs we walks up to the front the flap opens, and out comes the head of\nan inhuman being. This face is so classified, \u2019cause no human being\ncould have so much hair on its face and still breathe\u2014not without\ngills.\n\n\u201cHolee henhawks!\u201d gasps Dirty. \u201cWho have we here?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye am de ship-hoorder,\u201d comes from a hole in the hair.\n\n\u201cBale of hay from Sweden!\u201d gasps Dirty, and the hair opens again.\n\n\u201cAye am de ship-hoorder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a dugout for dandruff!\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cYah! Who are you fallers?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour successors,\u201d says I. \u201cYou can tie up your war-sack and pilgrim.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw?\u201d He seems to think it over, and shakes his head.\n\n\u201cAye tank Aye stay. Das iss my yob. Aye am de ship-hoorder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to classify yourself,\u201d grins Dirty. \u201cNature tagged\nyou. Us two are going to dry-nurse this bunch of animated socks and\nunderwear, so you might as well kiss \u2019em a fond fare-thee-well.\u201d\n\nThe hairy one shakes his head, and peers at us out of a pair of little\neyes.\n\n\u201cHe say to me, \u2018O-o-o-laf, I gif you twanty dollar month.\u2019 He say dat\nan\u2019 Aye stay for one month. Fifteen day Aye stay today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has been a long day for you, Olaf,\u201d agrees Dirty. \u201cIke, do you\nget that jargon?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. Alphabetical or Scenery promised him twenty a month, and today\nmakes fifteen days he has reigned.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo rain,\u201d says Olaf. \u201cDry as \u2014\u2014! Aye stay.\u201d\n\nHe ducked back under the tent, and a second later he sticks his head\nout again, and beside that bunch of hair is the muzzle of a rifle.\n\n\u201cAye tank Aye stay,\u201d he announces, and ducks inside again.\n\n\u201cDefied by a barber-boycotter,\u201d grunts Dirty. \u201cAre we bluffed, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot from my point of view,\u201d says I. \u201cYou take one side and I\u2019ll take\nthe other.\u201d There was four guy-ropes on each side, and it just took\nfour kicks per each to make that tent unsupporting, and the poor old\nthing comes down upon Olaf. Then me and Dirty assumes reclining\npositions, while Olaf wastes a few cartridges, wild-like.\n\nThen he emerges from a hole in the wreck, in time to be mounted by\nDirty Shirt, who rode that shepherd to the queen\u2019s taste. Olaf pitched\nconsiderable, but gave it up, and seemed receptive to civilized\nargument.\n\n\u201cStill think you\u2019ll stay?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\n\u201cVal, Aye go pretty soon but Aye coom back now,\u201d pants Olaf, pawing\nthe alkali out of his whiskers. \u201cAye boost some-t\u2019ing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like you had,\u201d admits Dirty.\n\n\u201cAye coom back\u2014yah! Aye get de law.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d says Dirty. \u201cLook at us, shepherd. We\u2019re the law. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\nHe looks at us, and his whiskers seem a heap agitated.\n\n\u201cYou\u2014are\u2014de\u2014law?\u201d he asks, deliberate-like.\n\n\u201cYou are looking at it,\u201d grins Dirty. \u201cHow does she look?\u201d\n\n\u201cVal\u2014\u201d he hitches up his rope belt, and picks up his war-sack\u2014\u201cval,\nAye can say dis mooch: Yorge Hokansen hay say to me, O-o-olaf, das\ncountry has too mooch bum law and no yustice! Yorge iss smart\u2014you\nbet.\u201d\n\nAnd me and Dirty stood there and watched the Hairy One fade out over\nthe hills towards Silver Bend.\n\n\u201cI hope he forgets us before he loads up on alcohol,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cI\nhate to chase even a shepherd off his job, but I reckon we\u2019re sort of\nshepherds-in-law, Ike, and we ain\u2019t to blame. Let\u2019s inventory the\ngrub.\u201d\n\nIn the grub-box is one can of milk, one can of corn, a little coffee\nand a quart of raw alcohol.\n\nDirty nods over the assortment.\n\n\u201cThat shepherd was good for fifteen days more, Ike, but the law sure\nis going to suffer internally. Let\u2019s put up the tent.\u201d\n\nOlaf left too soon to enjoy the rain. She came down plentiful and\nawful, and demonstrated to us that red flannel ain\u2019t noways\nwater-proof. When the morning came we peers out into a wet world, and\ntries to dry out enough tobacco to make a smoke. Then cometh a\ninterruption from without:\n\n\u201cSay, you lousy, slew-footed, blat-headed sheep-herder, come out\nhere!\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody calling you, Dirty,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cNot me, Ike. Somebody has been getting your mail.\u201d\n\n\u201cComing out?\u201d yells the voice again.\n\n\u201cYou sap-headed snake-hunter!\u201d\n\n\u201cTalks like a cow-man,\u201d opines Dirty.\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s making us a visit.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirty throws the tent-flap open, and we gets a view of a feller on a\nroan bronc.\n\n\u201cSay, you\u2014\u2014\u201d he begins, but he\u2019s looking down the muzzle of Dirty\u2019s\ngun, and his voice fails him.\n\n\u201cSpeaking to me?\u201d asks Dirty, soft-like.\n\n\u201cYou better put down that gun,\u201d says he. \u201cIt might save you a lot of\ntrouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cand if it went off and killed you, feller, it\nwould likely save you a lot of trouble, if this is the way you\u2019re in\nthe habit of speaking to strangers. What seems to itch you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour sheep!\u201d he yelps. \u201cHalf your danged woollies are over my line!\nYou agreed to keep them stinking sheep this side of the Mesquite, and\nthis morning I finds half of them across. \u201cYou get \u2019em out of there\npretty danged suddenlike or I\u2019ll massacree the bunch. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t dare,\u201d opines Dirty.\n\n\u201cThe \u2014\u2014 I don\u2019t! Just about why?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgainst the law. Them sheep are within the law, mister.\u201d\n\n\u201cYah? Well, let me tell you something, you lousy shepherd: I\u2019ll get my\npunchers and we\u2019ll show you! We\u2019ll chase \u2019em so far that\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGet off!\u201d orders Dirty. \u201cYou\u2019re up so high I can\u2019t hear your voice.\u201d\n\nHe had a gun, but I reckon he also had a weak heart, so he got off and\ngave me his gun. I reckon he\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 given us his weak heart, too, if\nwe\u2019d asked for it, \u2019cause Dirty has a nervous way of fingering a\ntrigger.\n\n\u201cWhat in \u2014\u2014 are you going to do now?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cHoord ships,\u201d grins Dirty. \u201cI\u2019m ship-hoorder.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d says he. \u201cYou\u2019re the Swede herder that \u2018Alcohol\u2019 Adams spoke\nabout.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaid you didn\u2019t have brains enough to wad a shotgun with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d he looks at Dirty\u2019s gun, serious-like\u2014\u201cwell, not to mean any\noffense, but I\u2019d say that Alcohol exaggerated a little, he meant a\ntwenty-two.\u201d\n\nBe it known that Alcohol Adams is so ornery that his own dog barks at\nhim. He\u2019d steal money from his own kids, and then lick thunder out of\nthem for losing it. Mosquitoes, horse-flies and rattlesnakes turn him\ndown like a white chip in a no-limit stud game, and his soul is so\nsmall and elusive that he has to drink straight alcohol in order to\nexhilarate it.\n\nYaller Rock got so disgusted with him that they sent him to the\nLegislature, where he collected all the loose money in sight, and\nshowed his appreciation of things by passing a few laws favoring\nsheep. He orated his views in Piperock, the same of which was contrary\nto our religion, and\u2014let me admit that some poor shooting was done.\n\nWhen he hit Paradise there was three hunks of lead in the cantle of\nhis saddle, which proved we held too low or the range was too great.\nWe held a mass meeting that night, and Magpie Simpkins chided us over\nour lack of ability.\n\nWe agreed to set aside six practise shots per day, against the time\nthat Alcohol or any other lawmaker might appear in our midst. I hopes\nyou hereby _sabes_ something of Alcohol\u2019s nature.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t run no blazer on me,\u201d says this feller. \u201cI\u2019m \u2018Sandy\u2019\nSorensen. What you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cBorrow your bronc,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cWe\u2019ll ride that roan double, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t ride double,\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cMaybe it never has,\u201d corrects Dirty, taking his foot out of the\nstirrup. \u201cCome up, Ike.\u201d\n\nSandy sure diagnosed that bronc right. I\u2019d trail my bet with his when\nhe says it won\u2019t ride double\u2014not meek-like. A bronc can\u2019t do its best\nwith two hundred and ninety pounds on its back, but I hope to gosh I\nnever ride that bronc single-handed when it\u2019s riled.\n\nMan, that animal done everything except fly, and at that the danged\nthing went high enough to convince the most skeptical that all it\nneeded was a short pair of wings to make good in that respect. First\nit gives a correct imitation of a post-hole digger, and then it goes\ndown that gully, changing ends like a whirligig. I\u2019ve got my wish-bone\nhooked over Dirty\u2019s shoulder, and every hop I can feel my finger\nslipping higher and higher up that cantle.\n\nSandy rides a double-rig saddle, and when we hits the first turn of\nthe gully I feels the rear cinch bust. From that on it\u2019s like riding a\nrocking-chair over sticks of dynamite.\n\nThe roan bucks along the edge of the washout, the bottom of which is\nabout ten feet below us, and I just starts to yelp, \u201cDon\u2019t get scared,\nDirty; she won\u2019t buck down there,\u201d when we hit the bottom, and I bit\nmy tongue over the first word.\n\nMy vertebr\u00e6 comes together like a string of box-cars getting hit by a\nwild engine, and then we yanked out of there and went angling up the\nhill as fast as that bronc can run.\n\n\u201cStill alive?\u201d I yelps.\n\n\u201cFrom my chin on up!\u201d he yells. \u201cWonder what this fool wants to climb\nthe hill for, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you stop her?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cBridle\u2019s gone, Ike. Ha-a-a-ang on!\u201d\n\nWe found out why the roan wanted to get a down-hill pull on us, \u2019cause\nas soon as we hit the grade the animal inagurates a new style of\nbucking. Was it effective? Oh, man, I\u2019d rise to remark it was. I just\nhung on and prayed. I used up all the white man\u2019s religion I ever\nheard about, and I\u2019m just beginning to make medicine to the totem of\nthe Alaskan Siwash when the cinch breaks.\n\nI feels myself float into space, and then I goes out in a blaze of\nbright lights. After while Old Man Misery seems to come along and runs\nhis fingers all over my carcass, and then I opens my eyes. I\u2019m laying\non my back with my feet up the side of a rock, and a short distance\nfrom me is Dirty, hanging by the back of his shirt to an old\nmesquite-snag.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nStanding there beside a pair of packed burros is the queerest-looking\npair of pelicans I ever seen. They\u2019re both wearing hard hats and\nblack-rimmed specs, and what you might expect such persons to wear in\nthe line of shirts, collars and neckties, but from the waist on down\nthey\u2019re clad in chaps and boots.\n\nOne of \u2019em is wearing a pair of Mexican spurs\u2014the kind with rowels the\nsize of a dollar and eighty-five cents. One of them has a belt draped\naround his waist, and in the holster is one of them single-shot\ntwenty-two pistols. The other is packing a pump shotgun.\n\nOne of \u2019em removes his specs and polishes \u2019em, careful-like.\n\n\u201cQuite remarkable, my friend!\u201d says he. \u201cQuite remarkable.\nThe\u2014er\u2014equine was no doubt desirous of removing its burden.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne would be led to accept such a theory,\u201d nods the other. \u201cWe have\nobserved the effect, my dear Middleton, but of course we know nothing\nof the cause. It really was quite remarkable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHolee suffering scissorbills!\u201d grunts Dirty, leaving half his shirt\non the snag and staggering to his feet. He stares at them and at me.\n\n\u201cIke, do you see the same thing I do?\u201d he whispers.\n\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d says I, lowering my feet. \u201cI hope I do, Dirty, otherwise\nI\u2019m a goner mentally. Is one of them apparitions wearing spurs?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank \u2014\u2014!\u201d gasps Dirty. \u201cWe see the same little details, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, Pettingill?\u201d crows one of \u2019em. \u201cYou objected to the boots\nand spurs, but the customs of a country must be observed. It is well.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps they will enlighten us to the best of their ability,\u201d says\nPettingill, adjusting his specs. \u201cIt will do no harm to inquire.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear gentlemen,\u201d says the one called Middleton, \u201cmay we ask you a\nquestion?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can take a chance,\u201d nods Dirty.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014er\u2014before I ask the question it might be well to introduce\nourselves. I am Professor Middleton of Boston, and the gentleman with\nme is Professor Pettingill of Philadelphia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciates it considerable,\u201d says Dirty, solemn-like. \u201cI am of\nthe Jones tribe, from here or hereabouts, and called Dirty Shirt. The\nperson with me is a Harper offspring, called Ike. Where are you from,\nIke?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere or thereabouts,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d says Professor Middleton. \u201cNow the question is this:\nPettingill and myself are dabbling in a few problems outside of our\nregular work, and this one has come to our notice: Are sheepherders\nreally insane? Do they acquire insanity from their occupation? Is\nthere anything about a\u2014er\u2014sheep that would cause a normal man to lose\nhis mind, as it were?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d nods Dirty. \u201cIt is.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d says Middleton. \u201cYou are following me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope nobody sees me if I do,\u201d grins Dirty.\n\n\u201cI contend that one\u2019s information on such a problem must come from\npersonal observation and not from hearsay or opinions of others. We\nrefuse to take circumstantial evidence, as it were. It seems that some\nof the natives are\u2014well, a bit touchy on the subject. I asked a\ngentleman for his opinion, and he\u2014well he\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cAt your city of Silver Bend I approached a man who was clad in\nleather trousers, and I asked him if I could get a little information\nfrom him regarding sheep. I am sure my tones were not belligerent, and\nI properly introduced myself before propounding the question.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHe did not answer. He deliberately crushed my hat over my nose and\nkicked my feet from under me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very true,\u201d nods the other one. \u201cI\u2014I thought perhaps we had met\nup with just the character we were investigating\u2014a mentally unbalanced\nsheep person. I soothed him to the best of my ability, begging him to\ncurb his profanity. Thinking to humor him, I said\u2014in kind tones:\n\n\u201c\u2018My dear fellow, there was no offense intended to you or your sheep.\nWe all love the little lambs.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\n\u201cWell, it may have been a coarse way of describing it, but another\nfellow came along after the mentally unbalanced one had stridden away,\nand he said\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2018My \u2014\u2014, what a mess!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you that shepherds were all crazy?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\n\u201cIt has been said,\u201d replies Professor Middleton. \u201cWe are\ninvestigating.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust what does the word \u2018crazy\u2019 mean?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cCrazy?\u201d Professor Pettingill looks shocked at our ignorance. \u201cCrazy\nmeans decrepit; weak; feeble; of weakened or disordered intellect.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome to think of it,\u201d remarks Professor Middleton, \u201cthat party who\nassaulted us was neither decrepit, weak nor feeble, Pettingill,\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was likely mad as \u2014\u2014 opines Dirty.\n\n\u201cAt least that is a good simile,\u201d nods Pettingill.\n\n\u201cJust about where are you pelicans headed for?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\n\u201cHeaded for?\u201d asks Pettingill. \u201cWhere are we going? We desire to\nlocate as near as possible to the habitat of the shepherd. We\npurchased the mules from a person in Silver Bend, who assisted us in\nselecting our provender. He tied it securely on the mules, and we\nhaven\u2019t taken if off since because we are afraid we could not get it\non again.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been in the hills?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cSince yesterday morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuffering scissorbills!\u201d snorts Dirty. \u201cYou left them burros packed\nall night, \u2019cause you\u2014 Say, you fellers ought to get jobs herding\nsheep. You sure qualify.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d says Middleton, pleased-like. \u201cDo you\u2014er\u2014think it could be\narranged?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo herd sheep?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly. It would put us closely in touch with the subject. We could\nmake a close study of the effects of the sheep animal upon the human\nbrain. My dear Pettingill, that would be wonderful! Could it be\narranged?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rise and howl that it could,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cYou get the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is too good to be true!\u201d exclaims Pettingill.\n\n\u201cThe same to you and many of them,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cHump yourselves,\nmules; we\u2019re going home.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThem professors seemed a heap interested in our rag house. They makes\na lot of notes in their little books while Dirty lays a fire in the\nlittle sheet-iron stove. Then they wants to know where the sheep are.\n\n\u201cYou fellers want to be regular shepherds, don\u2019t you?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\n\u201cOh, certainly,\u201d says Pettingill. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared for the worst. I am\nanxious to get first-hand information on the subject. Professor\nMiddleton and myself are never content to take hearsay evidence for\nany weighty subject.\u201d\n\nBeing as we ain\u2019t never seen the sheep ourselves, we has to trust to\nluck. We leads them pelicans to the top of a tall butte, and from\nthere we gets a glimpse of the herd. Several hundred are feeding on\nthe other side of a little creek, which we deciphers to be Mesquite\nCreek.\n\n\u201cNow, what\u2014er\u2014procedure do we adopt?\u201d asks Pettingill.\n\n\u201cSay that again,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cI missed it a foot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we supposed to do in a case of this kind?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014\u2014!\u201d says Dirty, and then he cranes his neck. \u201cLook what\u2019s going\non down there!\u201d\n\nWe sees four punchers riding toward them sheep, sort of swinging\naround to get between them and the creek. They bunches the whole\nworks, and proceeds to drift \u2019em over the hill. I recognizes one of\n\u2019em as Sandy Sorensen, on the roan, so I reckon it got home all right.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d nods Pettingill, wiping his glasses. \u201cNo doubt everything\nis all right, but just why are those men taking away our sheep?\u201d\n\n\u201cGents,\u201d says Dirty, rolling a smoke, \u201cyou have witnessed the theft of\na few hundred sheep. With your own eyes you have seen part of your\nherd swiped by outlaws. It is a common occurrence hereabouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean that we have been robbed in the broad light of day?\u201d asks\nPettingill, shocked-like. \u201cYou do? Well, I am amazed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cIt is such things that help to make us crazy.\u201d\n\nMaybe I could tell more of this tale; maybe not. Professor Pettingill\nknows things that I don\u2019t, so I\u2019d let him tell the rest of the tale as\nhe told it to his friends. Folks, meet Professor Pettingill, who is\nnow going to talk.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Harper\u2019s tale, up to the present, is partly true, or as Dirty\nShirt says, \u201cNear the truth as Ike ever told anything.\u201d I objected to\nthe word \u201cpelican\u201d as applied to Professor Middleton and myself, but\nIke assured me that it was a term of endearment, so I will let it\nremain.\n\nMany of their quaint phrases are in my note-book, but as yet I have\nnot had time to investigate their meaning. Their vocabulary of\nprofanity seemed unlimited, and at times very amusing. It seems that\nthey had little reverence for the finer things of life, and when we\ngently remonstrated with them, the one called Dirty Shirt said:\n\n\u201cOh, go to \u2014\u2014! What do you think this is\u2014a ladies\u2019 cemetery?\u201d\n\nI as yet fail to see the reference to a burial-place.\n\nAs Mr. Harper has already told you, we sat on the slope of the hill\nand watched the outlaws purloin part of the flock. I believe that my\nancestors were fighting-stock, for my gorge arose at the sight, and I\nwas filled with visions of revenge. Perhaps it was the spirit of the\nWest that possessed me, but at any rate I arose and shook a folded\nfist in their direction.\n\n\u201cGo ahead and cuss, professor,\u201d said Dirty Shirt. \u201cIf you get stuck\nfor a word, maybe me or Ike can supply it.\u201d\n\nNow, I am going to make no attempt to quote them. At times they talk\nin academic English, and at other times a jargon. Professor Middleton\nwill bear me out in saying that their language is both weird and\nwonderful, and also easy to acquire.\n\nI am sure that our friends were shocked at our conversation when we\nrelated our experiences, and it required constant vigilance over our\ntongues to keep from\u2014as Ike said\u2014\u201ctalking like a he-man.\u201d I feel that\nMiddleton was a worse offender than I in that respect.\n\nI said to Dirty Shirt\u2014\n\n\u201cWe shall most surely follow them and recover our property, shall we\nnot?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot,\u201d answered Ike. I am leaving off the prefix \u201cMr.\u201d as they rarely\nuse it in conversation.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said I, \u201cit is a plain case of theft, is it not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d replied Dirty Shirt, \u201cyou can call it anything from petty\nlarceny to train robbery, professor, but I\u2019d be \u2014\u2014 if I ever was so\nfond of sheep that I\u2019d sacrifice my skin in their interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean you are going to let them keep the sheep?\u201d asked\nMiddleton.\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014\u2019s delight!\u201d exclaimed Dirty Shirt. \u201cYou still talking sheep? Let\u2019s\ngo back to the rag shanty and scare up a feed.\u201d\n\nSo back we went. They showed no worry over the loss of the sheep, and\nI am certain they must be of value. The chops alone would be\nworth\u2014 But why quote prices? They led us back to the tent, and then\nDirty Shirt said:\n\n\u201cIf you pelicans want to be regular shepherds you\u2019ve got to learn how\nto cook. See what you can find in your own packs and then scare up a\nbatch of biscuits.\u201d\n\nOur pack-luggage had been stacked in front of the tent, and as I\nwalked over to investigate our provender Dirty Shirt added\u2014\n\n\u201cCook anything you see, \u2019cause my big insides are eating up the little\nones.\u201d\n\nHe did not use the word \u201cinsides,\u201d but its vulgar equivalent.\n\n\u201cScare up a biscuit?\u201d asked Middleton. \u201cHow does one scare a biscuit?\u201d\n\n\u201cBuild a fire in the stove,\u201d said Dirty Shirt. \u201cAll you have to do is\ntouch a match to the kindling, as the fire is all set. Then we\u2019ll show\nyou the next step.\u201d\n\nI went inside the tent, knelt beside the stove and scratched a match.\n\nThe sticks of wood over the kindling caught my eye. I removed one as I\ntouched the match. One must betray ignorance to acquire knowledge, so\nI carried one out to them.\n\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d said I, \u201cbut is this some new preparation to combat the\nscarcity of fuel?\u201d\n\nDirty Shirt glanced at the stick, then at the smoke coming out of the\nsmall stovepipe, and then he and Ike grasped their hats in their hands\nand dashed away. It really was ludicrous.\n\n\u201cCome on, you \u2014\u2014 fools!\u201d cried Ike without stopping to explain.\n\n\u201cWhat an amazing thing to do!\u201d exclaimed Middleton. \u201cWhy in the world\nare they\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nIt is of course ridiculous to say that the world came to an end before\nMiddleton\u2019s question had been propounded, but that is what seemed to\nhappen. The earth seemed to vomit dust, flame and smoke, and I seemed\nto feel myself being carried away. Ages later I awoke. I turned my\nhead, and then said to myself\u2014\n\n\u201cPettingill, you have been knocked topsy-turvy.\u201d\n\nI really had. I seemed to be trying to stand on my head in wet clay,\nalthough in reality I found that I was reclining, head down, on the\nside of a bank of what might be termed an abandoned water-course.\n\nModesty forbids that I tell what clothing is missing from my person. I\nmanaged to regain my natural poise, and turned sufficiently to allow\nmy feet to slide down.\n\nNear me is a section of the tent containing the red-flannel patch, and\nas I take stock of my surroundings that patch seemed to loosen, and\nfrom out through the aperture emerges the head of Professor Middleton.\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, are you all right?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe looked at me in a dazed sort of a way, and then spat out\u2014along with\na mouthful of clay:\n\n\u201cGo to \u2014\u2014! What do you think this is\u2014a ladies\u2019 cemetery?\u201d\n\nI could readily see that he was speaking from his subconscious mind,\nquoting from Dirty Shirt\u2019s reply to me. He got to his feet, not\nwithout visible effort, and we both looked at Dirty Shirt and Ike.\nTheir gaze seemed inquiring, but I was as much at sea as they.\n\n\u201cWe are still alive, as you may see,\u201d I volunteered.\n\n\u201cTakes a lot of dynamite to kill a shepherd,\u201d nodded Dirty.\n\n\u201cDynamite?\u201d asked Middleton. \u201cA powerful explosive?\u201d\n\n\u201cConcentrated \u2014\u2014,\u201d nodded Dirty.\n\n\u201cRegular old bustem quick. Some son-of-a-goat loaded the stove on us.\nMust \u2019a\u2019 been several sticks.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive, I believe,\u201d I replied. \u201cHere is the sixth.\u201d\n\nI opened my hand and showed them a mass of what appeared to be fine\nsawdust and grease.\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d cried Dirty, not profanely.\n\n\u201cThe old dictionary-digger choked that stick to a mush! Don\u2019t drop\nit!\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis order came too late. I suddenly realized what I was doing\u2014what I\nhad in my hands\u2014and I cast it down as a deadly thing. Dirty and Ike\nseemed to sigh with relief, and then Dirty said:\n\n\u201cLord, I ain\u2019t got much religion. I don\u2019t _sabe_ nothing about Jonah\nand the Ark, but I sure hands up thanks to whoever is to blame for\nblocking the trigger of that thing. Amen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you any special creed or religious affiliations?\u201d asked\nMiddleton.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Dirty Shirt shook his head. \u201cNot yet, but if you two are going\nto hang around this range for any length of time, I\u2019m going to join\nsomething\u2014that\u2019s a dead cinch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a cap in that stick, Dirty,\u201d said Ike. \u201cWonder it didn\u2019t\ngo.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d grunted Dirty. \u201cThere\u2019s something that protects drunks and\nidiots, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Dirty, you\u2019re right. Even them danged burros was removed far\nenough away to be safe. Drunks, idiots and jassacks\u2014all under\nprotection.\u201d\n\nHe certainly was not referring to Middleton or myself, as neither of\nus ever touches liquor in any form.\n\nLater on I insisted on knowing the probable destination of the sheep.\n\n\u201cOver in Sandy\u2019s corral,\u201d said Dirty Shirt. \u201cEverything is grist that\ncomes to his mill. He\u2019ll demand payment for the range he thinks the\nsheep ate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, is he a miller?\u201d asked Middleton. Dirty and Ike exchanged\nglances, and Ike said\u2014\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what education does for a feller, Dirty.\u201d\n\nEducation had little to do with it, as any one would know that no one\nbut a miller would have need of grist, and he spoke of \u201chis mill.\u201d\nDirty proved adept as a chef, and Middleton and myself enjoyed the\nfirst real meal since we left the dining-car. When it grew dark Ike\nkicked out the fire, leaving us in darkness. I remonstrated, but he\nsaid:\n\n\u201cBuild you one if you want it, old-timer, but remember this: Any\njasper who will load your stove won\u2019t hesitate to shoot at night.\u201d\n\nWe spread our blankets in the dark, and Ike and Dirty immediately fell\nto sleep. The novelty of looking at the stars, and the noises of the\nnight kept Middleton and myself awake. I thought of the stolen sheep\nand we conversed in whispers.\n\n\u201cThe loss of so many sheep must be greater than they care to\nacknowledge,\u201d whispered Middleton. \u201cThey are like the American Indian\ninasmuch as they are stoical under loss or punishment. It would be\nwonderful if we could recover the sheep. I am beginning to like them,\nPettingill.\u201d\n\nWe shook hands over it, procured our shotgun and pistol, and stole\naway silently, except for the tinkle of Middleton\u2019s spurs.\n\nWe crawled out of hearing, got our bearings from the stars and started\non our well-meant errand. We were going in single file along the side\nof a hill on a tiny path, which showed white in the dim light, when\nsuddenly we were confronted by a gigantic figure.\n\nIt towered above us, a black hulk, coming at a fast walk. I tried to\navoid the impact, but slipped and fell right into the path of the\nmonster.\n\nThe next instant it fell over me and into Middleton. I retained my\nshotgun. I had no way of knowing the fate of poor Middleton, but I ran\na short distance before I stopped.\n\nI saw the silhouette of it against the sky and for the first time in\nmy life I fired a gun. The impact of the shot threw me into a\ncactus-patch, and I feared for a time that it had crushed my lower\njaw. I managed to tear myself away from the clinging barbs, and stood\nerect.\n\n\u201cMiddleton!\u201d I cried. \u201cProfessor Middleton!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what in \u2014\u2014 do you want!\u201d\n\nYou can readily see that he was beginning to acquire the dialect of\nour associates.\n\n\u201cI shot it!\u201d I cried. \u201cI shot it!\u201d\n\n\u201cPettingill\u2014\u201d his voice was a bit sarcastic\u2014\u201cI will always thank the\nman who sold me these leather trousers. I didn\u2019t get hit with more\nthan\u2014let me see\u2014 Oh, I am unable to estimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeavens! Did I hit you, Middleton?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you did\u2014you\u2014er\u2014pelican!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat became of the monster?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid it say anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt spoke. It knocked me down, got to its feet and said, \u2018Aye am de\nship-hoorder,\u2019 and then it went on, Pettingill; it went on\u2014with my\nshirt in its hands. If you ever feel that you have to shoot again\u2014hold\nlower, old-timer.\u201d\n\nThen we went on. Middleton complained about the effects of the\nshooting, while I suffered untold agonies from cactus spines and the\neffects of that shotgun.\n\n\u201cWe should soon be able to see the mill,\u201d said Middleton, peering into\nthe night, \u201cbut all I can see is a huddle of low buildings. One is\nlarger than the rest, but none would be suitable for milling.\u201d\n\nWe walked closer and closer. Finally a canine barked several times,\nand a man came to the door of the larger house. Middleton and I\ncrouched down behind an old vehicle.\n\n\u201cSome more of those \u2014\u2014 coyotes, I reckon,\u201d said the man in the door.\n\u201cThey smell the sheep.\u201d\n\nAnd then he shut the door.\n\n\u201cThey do not mistrust us,\u201d said I, \u201cwhich simplifies things. No doubt\nthey will be enraged at the coyote in the morning.\n\nDo you know what a \u2014\u2014 coyote is, Middleton?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I do not, and perhaps it is just as well.\u201d\n\nJust then we heard the gentle lowing of a sheep. Perhaps it was the\ncall of one to its mate, and we knew we had come to the right place.\nWe crossed to a fence, inside of which we found the sheep.\n\nThe gate was locked, but Middleton immediately went to work to break\nit with a rock. The noise he made seemed to irritate the canine again,\ncausing it to emit staccato barks.\n\n\u201cI fear that the dog will upset our plans, Pettingill,\u201d said Middleton\nas we heard the door open again.\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d I reassured him. \u201cWe will use strategy. A coyote is a\nyoung wolf, don\u2019t you see? I will dissemble.\u201d\n\nI have never made a study of the cries and calls of wild animals, but\nI did the best I could. Clearing my throat, I began a low-voiced\nhowling, such as one hears in the Zoo at feeding-time.\n\nThe dog only barked the louder, and then came voices.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cCoyote \u2014\u2014!\u201d cried someone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a banshee with bronchial trouble, Sandy.\u201d\n\nI stopped howling, the dog stopped barking, and then we heard:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve a hunch, Micky. Give me them shells loaded with number sevens.\nThis ain\u2019t no buckshot party.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! Thank goodness, the barrier is removed!\u201d exclaimed Middleton, and\nI heard the chain fall.\n\nMiddleton gave the gate a shove, and it creaked open.\n\n\u201cSic \u2019em, Shep!\u201d cried a voice.\n\nIt is likely that the dog misunderstood orders, as I feel sure that\nits master meant us when he said \u201c\u2019em,\u201d but the dog circled us and\nwent through the fence after the sheep.\n\n\u201cRun!\u201d exclaimed Middleton. \u201cThey\u2019re coming out!\u201d\n\nMiddleton was right.\n\nJust at that moment one of those sheep tried to go between my legs. It\nwas a large one\u2014too large, in fact. I grasped it with one hand,\nquickly, holding my gun in the other, and attempted to ride it away,\nbut it sprang for a place where all of the fence was missing except\nfor a barbarous wire stretched along the top; and I went backward into\nthe dirt.\n\nI managed to roll over and get to my hands and knees just in time to\nbe struck a murderous blow from the rear, which projected me under the\nwire and outside the fence. There may have been other openings in that\nfence, but I will wager that a large per cent. of those sheep came\nthrough there and walked over me. After the procession of sharp hoofs\nhad passed me I crawled back and recovered my gun. I had no idea of\nwhere Middleton had gone. In fact I don\u2019t believe I gave him a\nthought.\n\nI got to my feet and limped away, feeling rather dazed, as a man might\nfeel after being hard hit, as it were. I toiled up the side of a hill,\nand suddenly I discerned Middleton. I knew him by the silhouette of\nhis hat against the sky.\n\n\u201cThank goodness, I have found you!\u201d I exclaimed.\n\n\u201cSame to you,\u201d he replied; and it was not Middleton\u2019s voice but the\nvoice of the party who suggested the banshee.\n\nI saw the glisten of his gun as he turned. I don\u2019t know what prompted\nme to do it, but I leveled my gun and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe roar deafened me and the concussion hurled me backward, but I had\npresence of mind enough to crawl away. Suddenly I fell into a\ndepression, where I lay quiet.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d cried a voice. \u201cWas that you, Micky?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was\u2014worse luck to me, Sandy!\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it a shepherd?\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t swear to nothing until I assay meself, but from the feel of\nme I\u2019d say it was a duck-hunter. Ouch! The divil blazed away at sixty\nfeet, and almost cut the boots off me legs! Bird-shot be the handful!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich way did he go, Micky?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow should I know? I always hides me head in a storm of bird-shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in thunder did you get that hard hat?\u201d\n\n\u201cDown be the corral. Did you ever know a shepherd to wear a baked\nbonnet before, Sandy?\u201d\n\nThey talked in low tones for a few moments, and then I heard the one\ncalled Sandy say:\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re well scattered, and there\u2019s no use hunting in the dark.\nNext time we\u2019ll pack Winchesters when them \u2014\u2014 woollies cross the\nMesquite.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, and I\u2019ll wear armor next time I hunt for hard-hatted shepherds\nin the night time,\u201d replied the other, and their voices died away into\nthe night.\n\nI managed to clamber out of the hole, suffering extreme torture all\nthe while. I had not the slightest idea of direction; in fact I seemed\nto be lost. At any rate I climbed the hill, went down the other side\nand then climbed another, where I sat down on a rock.\n\nIt was very, very quiet up there. Finally a dog came along. I tried to\nbe friendly, but it slunk away at my whistle. Then another one came;\nand another. I said to myself\u2014\n\n\u201cPettingill, there must be kennels near here.\u201d\n\nFrom a distant butte, against the pale light of the moon, I saw\nseveral more, and then came a wailing howl. From near me came a\nblood-curdling answer. I said to myself\u2014\n\n\u201cPettingill, those \u2018dogs\u2019 are wolves!\u201d The realization was painful. I\nreally believe I grew homesick. In all that waste I could not see a\ntree. I peered around. Ah! On a not too distant ridge stood a tree.\n\nI stood erect, grasped my gun, and hurried up the slope, spurred\nonward by the howls of at least a million savage throats. Perhaps it\nwas undignified, but I ran; actually ran. Luckily the branches grew\nlow, and I was able, suffering as I was, to climb into the sanctuary\nof those thick branches. I breathed a sigh of relief, and exclaimed\naloud\u2014\n\n\u201cThank Heaven for this tree!\u201d\n\nAnd from above me came\u2014\n\n\u201cPettingill, it is fortunate that you spoke, as I was about to pistol\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiddleton!\u201d I gasped. \u201cYou here in this tree?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I could find no other. I\u2014I thought perhaps you\u2014that perhaps that\nsheep had came back; don\u2019t you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cSheep? Sheep do not climb trees, Middleton.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I am glad to know there is some one thing that it could not do.\nI would readily believe it could climb, Pettingill.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you happen to pick this tree?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI claim no credit whatever, Pettingill. As the sheep came out of the\ngate, one of them struck me very, very abruptly. I landed outside the\nfence, where I tried to conceal myself, but it searched until it found\nme, and each time I tried to get up it knocked me down. From there to\nthis tree was just a succession of hard knocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is really too bad,\u201d I replied. \u201cI am physically imperfect\nmyself, Middleton. I think there is nothing more that could hurt me.\nHave you a comfortable seat up there, Middleton?\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t use it if I had!\u201d he actually grunted at me. \u201cRight at\npresent I am hanging over a bough like a carpet on a line. Pettingill,\nI may never, never sit down again.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe cheered each other as much as possible through the long night, and\nwere truly grateful when morning came. Looking at Middleton gave me a\nfaint idea of my own appearance. He had neither shirt nor hat, and the\nupper part of his body was streaked with blood and dirt. His limbs\nwere so stiff he could hardly walk, and mine were little better.\n\nI still retained my hat, although the crown would open and shut in the\nbreeze. We wished for the coats we had left at our camp. Then we\nwalked in what might be the right direction, and suddenly came to a\nroad. Not a well traveled thoroughfare, it is true, but at least a\nroadway. Along this we limped for a while, when we heard the creaking\nof a wagon behind us.\n\n\u201cJust suppose there should be some ladies aboard,\u201d suggested\nMiddleton, and we hastily crouched down beside some bushes.\n\nWhen the equipage was almost up to us we saw that the team was being\ndriven by a man, and that there were no ladies. We would ask for a\nride. We stepped into the road and threw up our hands, signaling him\nto stop. The driver was smoking his pipe, but as the team halted he\nopened his mouth, letting the pipe fall to the ground.\n\nThen he sprang to the ground, grasped his hat in his hand, and ran\nback down the road as fast as possible. His limbs were very badly\nbowed.\n\n\u201cWhat a ridiculous thing to do!\u201d exclaimed Middleton. \u201cAbandon his\nequipage in this manner before we have an opportunity to question him.\nWhat will we do, Pettingill?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will drive on. No doubt the team will take us some place. It is\nreasonable to suppose that a road leads to something. I hope we will\neventually arrive at some place where a physician resides.\u201d\n\nWe climbed in, and Middleton took charge of the lines. It was much\nbetter than walking, although neither of us could occupy the seat. All\nwent well until we came to a steep hill, where the horses seemed\nunable to check the speed of the wagon. I spoke sharply to Middleton\nabout our speed, and he rudely replied:\n\n\u201cOh, go to \u2014\u2014! If you\u2019re going to be a shepherd, be a regular one\u2014dang\nit!\u201d I fear that Middleton would soon acquire a profane vocabulary.\nSomehow we seemed to lose the road. I spoke to Middleton about it,\nthinking he did not know, and he shouted in my ear\u2014\n\n\u201cGo get it if you want it\u2014you danged pelican!\u201d\n\nI pondered over his apparent rudeness, and the next instant the team\nseemed to be taking us straight over a sharp pitch, the wagon swaying\nsharply as it crashed over rocks and brush. I caught a glimpse of the\nbottom of another abandoned water-course, and then, with a lurching\ncrash, I was hurled into oblivion.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI dreamed of lying under a plashing fountain, and as I opened my eyes\nI looked up at Dirty Shirt, who was pouring water into my face from\nhis large hat. I heard Ike\u2019s voice say:\n\n\u201cThis old pelican ain\u2019t dead, Dirty. He just spat out another tooth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, professor, when did you take a job driving a sheep-wagon?\u201d asked\nDirty Shirt.\n\n\u201cMiddleton was driving,\u201d I whispered. My voice was strangely weak.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Dirty Shirt scratched his head and peered across the\nhills\u2014\u201cwell, as a driver he\u2019s got more intestines than judgment. He\nsure is the short-cut kid.\u201d\n\nAfter a while Middleton sat up and essayed a grin. Several of his\nfront teeth were missing, which gave him a leering look. The wagon had\nsmashed to kindling-wood, but they told us that the team escaped\nserious injury. Dirty Shirt and Ike told us to take it easy while they\nrounded up the team, which we tried to do.\n\nMy gun was in the wreckage, but beyond a deep dent in the barrel it\nwas in very good shape. There were still four cartridges in it, and I\nmanaged to manipulate one into the firing-chamber. It is well to be\nprepared.\n\nMiddleton had acquired a pronounced lisp, caused, no doubt, by the\nmissing teeth. Suddenly we saw a man on horseback coming down toward\nus. Ordinarily I would have paid little heed to him, but we were\nbecoming chary of strangers. I stood up and threw my gun to my\nshoulder.\n\n\u201cWhat in \u2014\u2014 is the idea?\u201d he asked, halting. \u201cPut down that gun!\u201d\n\n\u201cThoot him!\u201d lisped Middleton. \u201cThoot him if he cometh too cloth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave a little sense and put down that gun,\u201d said the man.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let him ditharm your thuth-pithions,\u201d warned Middleton.\n\n\u201cGo back!\u201d he ordered. \u201cYou are in danger.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014\u2019s delight!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThere must \u2019a\u2019 been a break in the\nloco-lodge.\u201d\n\nAnd we watched him ride back to the top of the hill.\n\n\u201cNithe generalthip,\u201d applauded Middleton. \u201cLook\u2014thomebody elthe.\u201d\n\nAnother rider had joined him, and they both came riding down to us.\n\n\u201cI shall be compelled to fire upon you if you come too close,\u201d I\nwarned them.\n\n\u201cThoot \u2014\u2014 out of them if they monkey with uth,\u201d said Middleton.\n\nThe new one was very tall and grim-looking, with long mustaches and a\nvery large hat. He appeared to uncoil a long rope, and then showed his\nteeth in a snarling grin.\n\n\u201cGoing to shoot that thing, _hombre_?\u201d he asked, and I nodded\nemphatically.\n\n\u201cYou know best,\u201d he answered. \u201cGet all set, \u2019cause I\u2019m coming to get\nyou!\u201d\n\nHe spurred his horse forward and sidewise, and just then I fired. I\nfelt that I had wasted the shot, for I pointed where he had been. A\nterrific force seemed to crash into me, my lungs filled with smoke,\nand somewhere in my consciousness I seemed to hear a deafening\nexplosion. Then I seemed to feel myself bouncing and sliding over the\nground, only to stop with a grinding shock.\n\nA still, small voice within me seemed to say:\n\n\u201cPettingill, your sands of time are running low. A human being can\nstand only so much, and you\u2019ve had your share.\u201d\n\nAnd then I came back to life. I heard voices, far, far away, and some\none laughed. The laugh grated upon my nerves; it was as if some one\nhad laughed aloud at a funeral.\n\n\u201cThe barrel was dented two-thirds through and bent bad,\u201d stated a\nvoice. \u201cWonder it didn\u2019t blow his fool head off instead of kicking \u2014\u2014\nout of him.\u201d\n\nThen I sat up and looked around. I was propped against a rock. Around\nmy chest and over my arms is a tightly pulled rope, and the other end\nof the rope is fastened to the front end of a saddle on a horse. Two\nmen are standing near me, examining the remains of my shotgun.\n\nMiddleton is sitting near me, his hands and feet roped, and as I\nlooked at him he vulgarly spat out through where a tooth had been, and\nwinked at me. The two turned, and I saw upon the bosom of the taller\none the badge of a police officer.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that Olaf had brains enough to go crazy,\u201d said the\nother.\n\n\u201cGot to have some brains to start on, I reckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever can tell,\u201d nodded the tall one. \u201cThey caught him trying to put\ndynamite in the stove. He said he was going to blow up the law. Funny\nthing about it; somebody had filled his pants with bird-shot.\u201d\n\nJust then we were interrupted by the coming of Ike and Dirty Shirt,\nleading the runaway horses. They stared at the strangers.\n\n\u201cHoly henhawks!\u201d exclaimed Dirty. \u201cThey\u2019ve roped our shepherds!\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d nodded the tall one. \u201cYou might say a few words, Dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, Adams,\u201d nodded Dirty to the other one. \u201cMeet Professors\nPettingill and Middleton. Gents, this person is Alcohol Adams. The\ntall one is Magpie Simpkins, the sheriff of Yaller Rock County. He\u2019s\njust as bad as he looks. Magpie, what you got ropes on them pelicans\nfor? They ain\u2019t done nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, talk a little, can\u2019t you?\u201d asked the Magpie person.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Dirty Shirt rolled a smoke\u2014\u201cwe tried our dangedest to fulfil\nour deputation, Magpie. These scientific pelicans pilgrim along, and\nwe take \u2019em in. _Sabe?_ They wants to know from personal experience\nwhether it\u2019s sheep or just general wear and tear that puts a shepherd\ninto that mental condition known as crazy.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had a hard time, gents. They sure have herded in the\ninterests of science. We\u2019ve all had a hard time, Magpie, and I\u2019m off\nsheep forever. If Scenery Sims and Alphabetical Allen wants them sheep\nrounded up, they\u2019ll have to do it themselves. _Sabe?_ Law or no law,\nwe\u2019re all done.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\nThe sheriff scratched his long nose, and began a silent laugh that\nshook his gaunt frame.\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw! Haw! You poor, locoed snake-hunters! Listen: I didn\u2019t no\nmore than get started for Piperock when I meets Scenery and Alphy.\nThey\u2019ve done patched up their differences. We went over to notify you,\nbut you never showed up. I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw!\u201d replied Dirty Shirt vacantly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2014uh\u2014 Say, who in \u2014\u2014 owns the sheep we\u2019ve been dry-nursing,\nMagpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Mr. Adams. \u201cI had a Swede out here, but he went loco, I\nreckon, and tried to dynamite Scenery\u2019s camp, and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nIke stepped over and took the ropes off Middleton and myself.\n\n\u201cI met the driver of my grub-wagon,\u201d said Mr. Adams. \u201cHe had been\ndrinking too much lately, I reckon. Said he was held up by twin\ndevils, and that from now on he\u2019s through with booze or sheep.\u201d\n\nWe went down the hill, where Middleton and I recovered our coats.\nDirty Shirt and Ike caught our mules and put on the packs. Then they\ngave us each a rope to lead with.\n\n\u201cThe road over there will take you to Silver Bend,\u201d explained Ike.\n\nWe thanked him heartily, and then shook hands with them all.\n\n\u201cI hope you gents got the information you desired,\u201d said Magpie.\n\n\u201cNothing like personal experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeth, we got it,\u201d lisped Middleton. \u201cWe tholved it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t jump at it suddenlike,\u201d grinned Magpie.\n\n\u201cNo, thir. Not thudden.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon it\u2019s a mistake to say that all shepherds are crazy,\u201d\nobserved Magpie. \u201cCow-men use that expression more because they hate\nsheep than because the shepherd is loco. They figure that any man is\ncrazy who would herd sheep. _Sabe?_\n\n\u201cWhat is your scientific opinion, gents? Do you think they\u2019re crazy?\u201d\n\nI looked at Middleton inquiringly, and he nodded.\n\n\u201cI will thupport you, Pettingill.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cafter personal observation, I will say this much: If\nhe isn\u2019t crazy to begin with, and doesn\u2019t go crazy\u2014he is a superman.\u201d\n\n\u201cReckon the sheep are to blame?\u201d asked Adams.\n\n\u201cOf courth,\u201d lisped Middleton, caressing his back, \u201cthe theep are\nprimarily rethponthible, but I\u2019d thay that the greater evil cometh\nfrom general wear and tear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich goes to show that personal experience is better than hearsay,\u201d\nagreed Magpie.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily,\u201d I agreed, \u201cbut from now on I will be more than willing\nto take unsupported word for things I know nothing about. How about\nyou, Professor Middleton?\u201d\n\nMiddleton picked up his rope and spat through his vacant teeth.\n\n\u201cOh, \u2014\u2014! Leth go, Pettingill. You thaid a mouthful.\u201d",
