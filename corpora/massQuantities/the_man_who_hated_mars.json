    "body": "\u201cI WANT you to put me in prison!\u201d the big, hairy man said in a\ntrembling voice.\n\nHe was addressing his request to a thin woman sitting behind a desk\nthat seemed much too big for her. The plaque on the desk said:\n\nLT. PHOEBE HARRIS\nTERRAN REHABILITATION SERVICE\n\nLieutenant Harris glanced at the man before her for only a moment\nbefore she returned her eyes to the dossier on the desk; but long\nenough to verify the impression his voice had given. Ron Clayton was a\nbig, ugly, cowardly, dangerous man.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell? Dammit, say something!\u201d\n\nThe lieutenant raised her eyes again. \u201cJust be patient until I\u2019ve read\nthis.\u201d Her voice and eyes were expressionless, but her hand moved\nbeneath the desk.\n\nClayton froze. _She\u2019s yellow!_ he thought. She\u2019s turned on the\ntrackers! He could see the pale greenish glow of their little eyes\nwatching him all around the room. If he made any fast move, they would\ncut him down with a stun beam before he could get two feet.\n\nShe had thought he was going to jump her. _Little rat!_ he thought,\n_somebody ought to slap her down!_\n\nHe watched her check through the heavy dossier in front of her.\nFinally, she looked up at him again.\n\n\u201cClayton, your last conviction was for strong-arm robbery. You were\ngiven a choice between prison on Earth and freedom here on Mars. You\npicked Mars.\u201d\n\nHe nodded slowly. He\u2019d been broke and hungry at the time. A sneaky\nlittle rat named Johnson had bilked Clayton out of his fair share of\nthe Corey payroll job, and Clayton had been forced to get the money\nsomehow. He hadn\u2019t mussed the guy up much; besides, it was the sucker\u2019s\nown fault. If he hadn\u2019t tried to yell\u2014\n\nLieutenant Harris went on: \u201cI\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t back down now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it isn\u2019t fair! The most I\u2019d have got on that frame-up would\u2019ve\nbeen ten years. I\u2019ve been here fifteen already!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Clayton. It can\u2019t be done. You\u2019re here. Period. Forget\nabout trying to get back. Earth doesn\u2019t want you.\u201d Her voice sounded\nchoppy, as though she were trying to keep it calm.\n\nClayton broke into a whining rage. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that! It isn\u2019t fair! I\nnever did anything to you! I\u2019ll go talk to the Governor! He\u2019ll listen\nto reason! You\u2019ll see! I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_Shut up!_\u201d the woman snapped harshly. \u201cI\u2019m getting sick of it! I\npersonally think you should have been locked up\u2014permanently. I think\nthis idea of forced colonization is going to breed trouble for Earth\nsomeday, but it is about the only way you can get anybody to colonize\nthis frozen hunk of mud.\n\n\u201cJust keep it in mind that I don\u2019t like it any better than you do\u2014_and\nI didn\u2019t strong-arm anybody to deserve the assignment!_ Now get out of\nhere!\u201d\n\nShe moved a hand threateningly toward the manual controls of the stun\nbeam.\n\nClayton retreated fast. The trackers ignored anyone walking away from\nthe desk; they were set only to spot threatening movements toward it.\n\nOutside the Rehabilitation Service Building, Clayton could feel the\ntears running down the inside of his face mask. He\u2019d asked again and\nagain\u2014God only knew how many times\u2014in the past fifteen years. Always\nthe same answer. No.\n\nWhen he\u2019d heard that this new administrator was a woman, he\u2019d hoped she\nmight be easier to convince. She wasn\u2019t. If anything, she was harder\nthan the others.\n\nThe heat-sucking frigidity of the thin Martian air whispered around him\nin a feeble breeze. He shivered a little and began walking toward the\nrecreation center.\n\nThere was a high, thin piping in the sky above him which quickly became\na scream in the thin air.\n\nHe turned for a moment to watch the ship land, squinting his eyes to\nsee the number on the hull.\n\nFifty-two. Space Transport Ship Fifty-two.\n\nProbably bringing another load of poor suckers to freeze to death on\nMars.\n\nThat was the thing he hated about Mars\u2014the cold. The everlasting damned\ncold! And the oxidation pills; take one every three hours or smother in\nthe poor, thin air.\n\nThe government could have put up domes; it could have put in\nbuilding-to-building tunnels, at least. It could have done a hell of a\nlot of things to make Mars a decent place for human beings.\n\nBut no\u2014the government had other ideas. A bunch of bigshot scientific\ncharacters had come up with the idea nearly twenty-three years before.\nClayton could remember the words on the sheet he had been given when he\nwas sentenced.\n\n\u201cMankind is inherently an adaptable animal. If we are to colonize the\nplanets of the Solar System, we must meet the conditions on those\nplanets as best we can.\n\n\u201cFinancially, it is impracticable to change an entire planet from its\noriginal condition to one which will support human life as it exists on\nTerra.\n\n\u201cBut man, since he is adaptable, can change himself\u2014modify his\nstructure slightly\u2014so that he can live on these planets with only a\nminimum of change in the environment.\u201d\n\n\nSo they made you live outside and like it. So you froze and you choked\nand you suffered.\n\nClayton hated Mars. He hated the thin air and the cold. More than\nanything, he hated the cold.\n\nRon Clayton wanted to go home.\n\nThe Recreation Building was just ahead; at least it would be warm\ninside. He pushed in through the outer and inner doors, and he heard\nthe burst of music from the jukebox. His stomach tightened up into a\nhard cramp.\n\nThey were playing Heinlein\u2019s _Green Hills of Earth_.\n\nThere was almost no other sound in the room, although it was full of\npeople. There were plenty of colonists who claimed to like Mars, but\neven they were silent when that song was played.\n\nClayton wanted to go over and smash the machine\u2014make it stop reminding\nhim. He clenched his teeth and his fists and his eyes and cursed\nmentally. _God, how I hate Mars!_\n\n\nWhen the hauntingly nostalgic last chorus faded away, he walked over to\nthe machine and fed it full of enough coins to keep it going on\nsomething else until he left.\n\nAt the bar, he ordered a beer and used it to wash down another\noxidation tablet. It wasn\u2019t good beer; it didn\u2019t even deserve the name.\nThe atmospheric pressure was so low as to boil all the carbon dioxide\nout of it, so the brewers never put it back in after fermentation.\n\nHe was sorry for what he had done\u2014really and truly sorry. If they\u2019d\nonly give him one more chance, he\u2019d make good. Just one more chance.\nHe\u2019d work things out.\n\nHe\u2019d promised himself that both times they\u2019d put him up before, but\nthings had been different then. He hadn\u2019t really been given another\nchance, what with parole boards and all.\n\nClayton closed his eyes and finished the beer. He ordered another.\n\nHe\u2019d worked in the mines for fifteen years. It wasn\u2019t that he minded\nwork really, but the foreman had it in for him. Always giving him a bad\ntime; always picking out the lousy jobs for him.\n\nLike the time he\u2019d crawled into a side-boring in Tunnel 12 for a nap\nduring lunch and the foreman had caught him. When he promised never to\ndo it again if the foreman wouldn\u2019t put it on report, the guy said,\n\u201cYeah. Sure. Hate to hurt a guy\u2019s record.\u201d\n\nThen he\u2019d put Clayton on report anyway. Strictly a rat.\n\nNot that Clayton ran any chance of being fired; they never fired\nanybody. But they\u2019d fined him a day\u2019s pay. A whole day\u2019s pay.\n\nHe tapped his glass on the bar, and the barman came over with another\nbeer. Clayton looked at it, then up at the barman. \u201cPut a head on it.\u201d\n\nThe bartender looked at him sourly. \u201cI\u2019ve got some soapsuds here,\nClayton, and one of these days I\u2019m gonna put some in your beer if you\nkeep pulling that gag.\u201d\n\nThat was the trouble with some guys. No sense of humor.\n\nSomebody came in the door and then somebody else came in behind him, so\nthat both inner and outer doors were open for an instant. A blast of\nicy breeze struck Clayton\u2019s back, and he shivered. He started to say\nsomething, then changed his mind; the doors were already closed again,\nand besides, one of the guys was bigger than he was.\n\nThe iciness didn\u2019t seem to go away immediately. It was like the mine.\nLittle old Mars was cold clear down to her core\u2014or at least down as far\nas they\u2019d drilled. The walls were frozen and seemed to radiate a chill\nthat pulled the heat right out of your blood.\n\nSomebody was playing _Green Hills_ again, damn them. Evidently all of\nhis own selections had run out earlier than he\u2019d thought they would.\n\nHell! There was nothing to do here. He might as well go home.\n\n\u201cGimme another beer, Mac.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d go home as soon as he finished this one.\n\nHe stood there with his eyes closed, listening to the music and hating\nMars.\n\nA voice next to him said: \u201cI\u2019ll have a whiskey.\u201d\n\n\nThe voice sounded as if the man had a bad cold, and Clayton turned\nslowly to look at him. After all the sterilization they went through\nbefore they left Earth, nobody on Mars ever had a cold, so there was\nonly one thing that would make a man\u2019s voice sound like that.\n\nClayton was right. The fellow had an oxygen tube clamped firmly over\nhis nose. He was wearing the uniform of the Space Transport Service.\n\n\u201cJust get in on the ship?\u201d Clayton asked conversationally.\n\nThe man nodded and grinned. \u201cYeah. Four hours before we take off\nagain.\u201d He poured down the whiskey. \u201cSure cold out.\u201d\n\nClayton agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s always cold.\u201d He watched enviously as the\nspaceman ordered another whiskey.\n\nClayton couldn\u2019t afford whiskey. He probably could have by this time,\nif the mines had made him a foreman, like they should have.\n\nMaybe he could talk the spaceman out of a couple of drinks.\n\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Clayton. Ron Clayton.\u201d\n\nThe spaceman took the offered hand. \u201cMine\u2019s Parkinson, but everybody\ncalls me Parks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, Parks. Uh\u2014can I buy you a beer?\u201d\n\nParks shook his head. \u201cNo, thanks. I started on whiskey. Here, let me\nbuy you one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014thanks. Don\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d\n\nThey drank them in silence, and Parks ordered two more.\n\n\u201cBeen here long?\u201d Parks asked.\n\n\u201cFifteen years. Fifteen long, long years.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you\u2014uh\u2014I mean\u2014\u201d Parks looked suddenly confused.\n\nClayton glanced quickly to make sure the bartender was out of earshot.\nThen he grinned. \u201cYou mean am I a convict? Nah. I came here because I\nwanted to. But\u2014\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201c\u2014we don\u2019t talk about it around\nhere. You know.\u201d He gestured with one hand\u2014a gesture that took in\neveryone else in the room.\n\nParks glanced around quickly, moving only his eyes. \u201cYeah. I see,\u201d he\nsaid softly.\n\n\u201cThis your first trip?\u201d asked Clayton.\n\n\u201cFirst one to Mars. Been on the Luna run a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cLow pressure bother you much?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much. We only keep it at six pounds in the ships. Half helium and\nhalf oxygen. Only thing that bothers me is the oxy here. Or rather, the\noxy that _isn\u2019t_ here.\u201d He took a deep breath through his nose tube to\nemphasize his point.\n\nClayton clamped his teeth together, making the muscles at the side of\nhis jaw stand out.\n\nParks didn\u2019t notice. \u201cYou guys have to take those pills, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to take them once. Got stranded on Luna. The cat I was in broke\ndown eighty some miles from Aristarchus Base and I had to walk\nback\u2014with my oxy low. Well, I figured\u2014\u201d\n\n\nClayton listened to Parks\u2019 story with a great show of attention, but he\nhad heard it before. This \u201clost on the moon\u201d stuff and its variations\nhad been going the rounds for forty years. Every once in a while, it\nactually did happen to someone; just often enough to keep the story\ngoing.\n\nThis guy did have a couple of new twists, but not enough to make the\nstory worthwhile.\n\n\u201cBoy,\u201d Clayton said when Parks had finished, \u201cyou were lucky to come\nout of that alive!\u201d\n\nParks nodded, well pleased with himself, and bought another round of\ndrinks.\n\n\u201cSomething like that happened to me a couple of years ago,\u201d Clayton\nbegan. \u201cI\u2019m supervisor on the third shift in the mines at Xanthe, but\nat the time, I was only a foreman. One day, a couple of guys went to a\nbranch tunnel to\u2014\u201d\n\nIt was a very good story. Clayton had made it up himself, so he knew\nthat Parks had never heard it before. It was gory in just the right\nplaces, with a nice effect at the end.\n\n\u201c\u2014so I had to hold up the rocks with my back while the rescue crew\npulled the others out of the tunnel by crawling between my legs.\nFinally, they got some steel beams down there to take the load off, and\nI could let go. I was in the hospital for a week,\u201d he finished.\n\nParks was nodding vaguely. Clayton looked up at the clock above the bar\nand realized that they had been talking for better than an hour. Parks\nwas buying another round.\n\nParks was a hell of a nice fellow.\n\nThere was, Clayton found, only one trouble with Parks. He got to\ntalking so loud that the bartender refused to serve either one of them\nany more.\n\n\nThe bartender said Clayton was getting loud, too, but it was just\nbecause he had to talk loud to make Parks hear him.\n\nClayton helped Parks put his mask and parka on and they walked out into\nthe cold night.\n\nParks began to sing _Green Hills_. About halfway through, he stopped\nand turned to Clayton.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Indiana.\u201d\n\nClayton had already spotted him as an American by his accent.\n\n\u201cIndiana? That\u2019s nice. Real nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. You talk about green hills, we got green hills in Indiana. What\ntime is it?\u201d\n\nClayton told him.\n\n\u201cJeez-krise! Ol\u2019 spaship takes off in an hour. Ought to have one more\ndrink first.\u201d\n\nClayton realized he didn\u2019t like Parks. But maybe he\u2019d buy a bottle.\n\nSharkie Johnson worked in Fuels Section, and he made a nice little\nsideline of stealing alcohol, cutting it, and selling it. He thought it\nwas real funny to call it Martian Gin.\n\nClayton said: \u201cLet\u2019s go over to Sharkie\u2019s. Sharkie will sell us a\nbottle.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Parks. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a bottle. That\u2019s what we need: a\nbottle.\u201d\n\nIt was quite a walk to the Shark\u2019s place. It was so cold that even\nParks was beginning to sober up a little. He was laughing like hell\nwhen Clayton started to sing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going over to the Shark\u2019s\nTo buy a jug of gin for Parks!\nHi ho, hi ho, hi ho!\u201d\n\nOne thing about a few drinks; you didn\u2019t get so cold. You didn\u2019t feel\nit too much, anyway.\n\n\nThe Shark still had his light on when they arrived. Clayton whispered\nto Parks: \u201cI\u2019ll go in. He knows me. He wouldn\u2019t sell it if you were\naround. You got eight credits?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure I got eight credits. Just a minute, and I\u2019ll give you eight\ncredits.\u201d He fished around for a minute inside his parka, and pulled\nout his notecase. His gloved fingers were a little clumsy, but he\nmanaged to get out a five and three ones and hand them to Clayton.\n\n\u201cYou wait out here,\u201d Clayton said.\n\nHe went in through the outer door and knocked on the inner one. He\nshould have asked for ten credits. Sharkie only charged five, and that\nwould leave him three for himself. But he could have got ten\u2014maybe\nmore.\n\nWhen he came out with the bottle, Parks was sitting on a rock,\nshivering.\n\n\u201cJeez-krise!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out here. Let\u2019s get to someplace\nwhere it\u2019s warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. I got the bottle. Want a drink?\u201d\n\nParks took the bottle, opened it, and took a good belt out of it.\n\n\u201cHooh!\u201d he breathed. \u201cPretty smooth.\u201d\n\nAs Clayton drank, Parks said: \u201cHey! I better get back to the field! I\nknow! We can go to the men\u2019s room and finish the bottle before the ship\ntakes off! Isn\u2019t that a good idea? It\u2019s warm there.\u201d\n\nThey started back down the street toward the spacefield.\n\n\u201cYep, I\u2019m from Indiana. Southern part, down around Bloomington,\u201d Parks\nsaid. \u201cGimme the jug. Not Bloomington, Illinois\u2014Bloomington, Indiana.\nWe really got green hills down there.\u201d He drank, and handed the bottle\nback to Clayton. \u201cPers-nally, I don\u2019t see why anybody\u2019d stay on Mars.\nHere y\u2019are, practic\u2019ly on the equator in the middle of the summer, and\nit\u2019s colder than hell. Brrr!\n\n\u201cNow if you was smart, you\u2019d go home, where it\u2019s warm. Mars wasn\u2019t\nbuilt for people to live on, anyhow. I don\u2019t see how you stand it.\u201d\n\nThat was when Clayton decided he really hated Parks.\n\nAnd when Parks said: \u201cWhy be dumb, friend? Whyn\u2019t you go home?\u201d Clayton\nkicked him in the stomach, hard.\n\n\u201cAnd that, that\u2014\u201d Clayton said as Parks doubled over.\n\nHe said it again as he kicked him in the head. And in the ribs. Parks\nwas gasping as he writhed on the ground, but he soon lay still.\n\nThen Clayton saw why. Parks\u2019 nose tube had come off when Clayton\u2019s foot\nstruck his head.\n\nParks was breathing heavily, but he wasn\u2019t getting any oxygen.\n\nThat was when the Big Idea hit Ron Clayton. With a nosepiece on like\nthat, you couldn\u2019t tell who a man was. He took another drink from the\njug and then began to take Parks\u2019 clothes off.\n\nThe uniform fit Clayton fine, and so did the nose mask. He dumped his\nown clothing on top of Parks\u2019 nearly nude body, adjusted the little\noxygen tank so that the gas would flow properly through the mask, took\nthe first deep breath of good air he\u2019d had in fifteen years, and walked\ntoward the spacefield.\n\n\nHe went into the men\u2019s room at the Port Building, took a drink, and\nfelt in the pockets of the uniform for Parks\u2019 identification. He found\nit and opened the booklet. It read:\n\nPARKINSON, HERBERT J.\nSteward 2nd Class, STS\n\nAbove it was a photo, and a set of fingerprints.\n\nClayton grinned. They\u2019d never know it wasn\u2019t Parks getting on the ship.\n\nParks was a steward, too. A cook\u2019s helper. That was good. If he\u2019d been\na jetman or something like that, the crew might wonder why he wasn\u2019t on\nduty at takeoff. But a steward was different.\n\nClayton sat for several minutes, looking through the booklet and\ndrinking from the bottle. He emptied it just before the warning sirens\nkeened through the thin air.\n\nClayton got up and went outside toward the ship.\n\n\u201cWake up! Hey, you! Wake up!\u201d\n\nSomebody was slapping his cheeks. Clayton opened his eyes and looked at\nthe blurred face over his own.\n\nFrom a distance, another voice said: \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\nThe blurred face said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. He was asleep behind these cases.\nI think he\u2019s drunk.\u201d\n\nClayton wasn\u2019t drunk\u2014he was sick. His head felt like hell. Where the\ndevil was he?\n\n\u201cGet up, bud. Come on, get up!\u201d\n\nClayton pulled himself up by holding to the man\u2019s arm. The effort made\nhim dizzy and nauseated.\n\nThe other man said: \u201cTake him down to sick bay, Casey. Get some thiamin\ninto him.\u201d\n\nClayton didn\u2019t struggle as they led him down to the sick bay. He was\ntrying to clear his head. Where was he? He must have been pretty drunk\nlast night.\n\nHe remembered meeting Parks. And getting thrown out by the bartender.\nThen what?\n\nOh, yeah. He\u2019d gone to the Shark\u2019s for a bottle. From there on, it was\nmostly gone. He remembered a fight or something, but that was all that\nregistered.\n\nThe medic in the sick bay fired two shots from a hypo-gun into both\narms, but Clayton ignored the slight sting.\n\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d\n\n\u201cReal original. Here, take these.\u201d He handed Clayton a couple of\ncapsules, and gave him a glass of water to wash them down with.\n\nWhen the water hit his stomach, there was an immediate reaction.\n\n\u201cOh, Christ!\u201d the medic said. \u201cGet a mop, somebody. Here, bud; heave\ninto this.\u201d He put a basin on the table in front of Clayton.\n\nIt took them the better part of an hour to get Clayton awake enough to\nrealize what was going on and where he was. Even then, he was plenty\ngroggy.\n\n\nIt was the First Officer of the STS-52 who finally got the story\nstraight. As soon as Clayton was in condition, the medic and the\nquartermaster officer who had found him took him up to the First\nOfficer\u2019s compartment.\n\n\u201cI was checking through the stores this morning when I found this man.\nHe was asleep, dead drunk, behind the crates.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was drunk, all right,\u201d supplied the medic. \u201cI found this in his\npocket.\u201d He flipped a booklet to the First Officer.\n\nThe First was a young man, not older than twenty-eight with\ntough-looking gray eyes. He looked over the booklet.\n\n\u201cWhere did you get Parkinson\u2019s ID booklet? And his uniform?\u201d\n\nClayton looked down at his clothes in wonder. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou _don\u2019t know_? That\u2019s a hell of an answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I was drunk,\u201d Clayton said defensively. \u201cA man doesn\u2019t know what\nhe\u2019s doing when he\u2019s drunk.\u201d He frowned in concentration. He knew he\u2019d\nhave to think up some story.\n\n\u201cI kind of remember we made a bet. I bet him I could get on the ship.\nSure\u2014I remember, now. That\u2019s what happened; I bet him I could get on\nthe ship and we traded clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt my place, sleeping it off, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout his oxy-mask?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I gave him my oxidation pills for the mask.\u201d\n\nThe First shook his head. \u201cThat sounds like the kind of trick Parkinson\nwould pull, all right. I\u2019ll have to write it up and turn you both in to\nthe authorities when we hit Earth.\u201d He eyed Clayton. \u201cWhat\u2019s your\nname?\u201d\n\n\u201cCartwright. Sam Cartwright,\u201d Clayton said without batting an eye.\n\n\u201cVolunteer or convicted colonist?\u201d\n\n\u201cVolunteer.\u201d\n\nThe First looked at him for a long moment, disbelief in his eyes.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter. Volunteer or convict, there was no place Clayton\ncould go. From the officer\u2019s viewpoint, he was as safely imprisoned in\nthe spaceship as he would be on Mars or a prison on Earth.\n\n\nThe First wrote in the log book, and then said: \u201cWell, we\u2019re one man\nshort in the kitchen. You wanted to take Parkinson\u2019s place; brother,\nyou\u2019ve got it\u2014without pay.\u201d He paused for a moment.\n\n\u201cYou know, of course,\u201d he said judiciously, \u201cthat you\u2019ll be shipped\nback to Mars immediately. And you\u2019ll have to work out your passage both\nways\u2014it will be deducted from your pay.\u201d\n\nClayton nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what else will happen. If there\u2019s a conviction, you may\nlose your volunteer status on Mars. And there may be fines taken out of\nyour pay, too.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s all, Cartwright. You can report to Kissman in the\nkitchen.\u201d\n\nThe First pressed a button on his desk and spoke into the intercom.\n\u201cWho was on duty at the airlock when the crew came aboard last night?\nSend him up. I want to talk to him.\u201d\n\nThen the quartermaster officer led Clayton out the door and took him to\nthe kitchen.\n\nThe ship\u2019s driver tubes were pushing it along at a steady five hundred\ncentimeters per second squared acceleration, pushing her steadily\ncloser to Earth with a little more than half a gravity of drive.\n\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much for Clayton to do, really. He helped to select the\nfoods that went into the automatics, and he cleaned them out after each\nmeal was cooked. Once every day, he had to partially dismantle them for\na really thorough going-over.\n\nAnd all the time, he was thinking.\n\nParkinson must be dead; he knew that. That meant the Chamber. And even\nif he wasn\u2019t, they\u2019d send Clayton back to Mars. Luckily, there was no\nway for either planet to communicate with the ship; it was hard enough\nto keep a beam trained on a planet without trying to hit such a\ncomparatively small thing as a ship.\n\nBut they would know about it on Earth by now. They would pick him up\nthe instant the ship landed. And the best he could hope for was a\nreturn to Mars.\n\nNo, by God! He wouldn\u2019t go back to that frozen mud-ball! He\u2019d stay on\nEarth, where it was warm and comfortable and a man could live where he\nwas meant to live. Where there was plenty of air to breathe and plenty\nof water to drink. Where the beer tasted like beer and not like slop.\nEarth. Good green hills, the like of which exists nowhere else.\n\nSlowly, over the days, he evolved a plan. He watched and waited and\nchecked each little detail to make sure nothing would go wrong. It\n_couldn\u2019t_ go wrong. He didn\u2019t want to die, and he didn\u2019t want to go\nback to Mars.\n\nNobody on the ship liked him; they couldn\u2019t appreciate his position. He\nhadn\u2019t done anything to them, but they just didn\u2019t like him. He didn\u2019t\nknow why; he\u2019d _tried_ to get along with them. Well, if they didn\u2019t\nlike him, the hell with them.\n\nIf things worked out the way he figured, they\u2019d be damned sorry.\n\nHe was very clever about the whole plan. When turn-over came, he\npretended to get violently spacesick. That gave him an opportunity to\nsteal a bottle of chloral hydrate from the medic\u2019s locker.\n\nAnd, while he worked in the kitchen, he spent a great deal of time\nsharpening a big carving knife.\n\nOnce, during his off time, he managed to disable one of the ship\u2019s two\nlifeboats. He was saving the other for himself.\n\nThe ship was eight hours out from Earth and still decelerating when\nClayton pulled his getaway.\n\n\nIt was surprisingly easy. He was supposed to be asleep when he sneaked\ndown to the drive compartment with the knife. He pushed open the door,\nlooked in, and grinned like an ape.\n\nThe Engineer and the two jetmen were out cold from the chloral hydrate\nin the coffee from the kitchen.\n\nMoving rapidly, he went to the spares locker and began methodically to\nsmash every replacement part for the drivers. Then he took three of the\nsignal bombs from the emergency kit, set them for five minutes, and\nplaced them around the driver circuits.\n\nHe looked at the three sleeping men. What if they woke up before the\nbombs went off? He didn\u2019t want to kill them though. He wanted them to\nknow what had happened and who had done it.\n\nHe grinned. There was a way. He simply had to drag them outside and jam\nthe door lock. He took the key from the Engineer, inserted it, turned\nit, and snapped off the head, leaving the body of the key still in the\nlock. Nobody would unjam it in the next four minutes.\n\nThen he began to run up the stairwell toward the good lifeboat.\n\nHe was panting and out of breath when he arrived, but no one had\nstopped him. No one had even seen him.\n\nHe clambered into the lifeboat, made everything ready, and waited.\n\nThe signal bombs were not heavy charges; their main purposes was to\nmake a flare bright enough to be seen for thousands of miles in space.\nFluorine and magnesium made plenty of light\u2014and heat.\n\nQuite suddenly, there was no gravity. He had felt nothing, but he knew\nthat the bombs had exploded. He punched the LAUNCH switch on the\ncontrol board of the lifeboat, and the little ship leaped out from the\nside of the greater one.\n\nThen he turned on the drive, set it at half a gee, and watched the\nSTS-52 drop behind him. It was no longer decelerating, so it would miss\nEarth and drift on into space. On the other hand, the lifeship would\ncome down very neatly within a few hundred miles of the spaceport in\nUtah, the destination of the STS-52.\n\nLanding the lifeship would be the only difficult part of the maneuver,\nbut they were designed to be handled by beginners. Full instructions\nwere printed on the simplified control board.\n\n\nClayton studied them for a while, then set the alarm to waken him in\nseven hours and dozed off to sleep.\n\nHe dreamed of Indiana. It was full of nice, green hills and leafy\nwoods, and Parkinson was inviting him over to his mother\u2019s house for\nchicken and whiskey. And all for free.\n\nBeneath the dream was the calm assurance that they would never catch\nhim and send him back. When the STS-52 failed to show up, they would\nthink he had been lost with it. They would never look for him.\n\nWhen the alarm rang, Earth was a mottled globe looming hugely beneath\nthe ship. Clayton watched the dials on the board, and began to follow\nthe instructions on the landing sheet.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t too good at it. The accelerometer climbed higher and higher,\nand he felt as though he could hardly move his hands to the proper\nswitches.\n\nHe was less than fifteen feet off the ground when his hand slipped. The\nship, out of control, shifted, spun, and toppled over on its side,\nsmashing a great hole in the cabin.\n\nClayton shook his head and tried to stand up in the wreckage. He got to\nhis hands and knees, dizzy but unhurt, and took a deep breath of the\nfresh air that was blowing in through the hole in the cabin.\n\nIt felt just like home.\n\n\nBureau of Criminal Investigation\nRegional Headquarters\nCheyenne, Wyoming\n20 January 2102\n\nTo: Space Transport Service\nSubject: Lifeship 2, STS-52\nAttention Mr. P. D. Latimer\n\nDear Paul,\n\nI have on hand the copies of your reports on the rescue of the men on\nthe disabled STS-52. It is fortunate that the Lunar radar stations\ncould compute their orbit.\n\nThe detailed official report will follow, but briefly, this is what\nhappened:\n\nThe lifeship landed\u2014or, rather, crashed\u2014several miles west of Cheyenne,\nas you know, but it was impossible to find the man who was piloting it\nuntil yesterday because of the weather.\n\nHe has been identified as Ronald Watkins Clayton, exiled to Mars\nfifteen years ago.\n\nEvidently, he didn\u2019t realize that fifteen years of Martian gravity had\nso weakened his muscles that he could hardly walk under the pull of a\nfull Earth gee.\n\nAs it was, he could only crawl about a hundred yards from the wrecked\nlifeship before he collapsed.\n\nWell, I hope this clears up everything.\n\nI hope you\u2019re not getting the snow storms up there like we\u2019ve been\ngetting them.\n\nJohn B.
