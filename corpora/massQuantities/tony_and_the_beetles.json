    "body": "\nReddish-yellow sunlight filtered through the thick quartz windows into\nthe sleep-compartment. Tony Rossi yawned, stirred a little, then opened\nhis black eyes and sat up quickly. With one motion he tossed the covers\nback and slid to the warm metal floor. He clicked off his alarm clock\nand hurried to the closet.\n\nIt looked like a nice day. The landscape outside was motionless,\nundisturbed by winds or dust-shift. The boy's heart pounded excitedly.\nHe pulled his trousers on, zipped up the reinforced mesh, struggled into\nhis heavy canvas shirt, and then sat down on the edge of the cot to tug\non his boots. He closed the seams around their tops and then did the\nsame with his gloves. Next he adjusted the pressure on his pump unit and\nstrapped it between his shoulder blades. He grabbed his helmet from the\ndresser, and he was ready for the day.\n\nIn the dining-compartment his mother and father had finished breakfast.\nTheir voices drifted to him as he clattered down the ramp. A disturbed\nmurmur; he paused to listen. What were they talking about? Had he done\nsomething wrong, again?\n\nAnd then he caught it. Behind their voices was another voice. Static and\ncrackling pops. The all-system audio signal from Rigel IV. They had it\nturned up full blast; the dull thunder of the monitor's voice boomed\nloudly. The war. Always the war. He sighed, and stepped out into the\ndining-compartment.\n\n\"Morning,\" his father muttered.\n\n\"Good morning, dear,\" his mother said absently. She sat with her head\nturned to one side, wrinkles of concentration webbing her forehead. Her\nthin lips were drawn together in a tight line of concern. His father had\npushed his dirty dishes back and was smoking, elbows on the table, dark\nhairy arms bare and muscular. He was scowling, intent on the jumbled\nroar from the speaker above the sink.\n\n\"How's it going?\" Tony asked. He slid into his chair and reached\nautomatically for the ersatz grapefruit. \"Any news from Orion?\"\n\nNeither of them answered. They didn't hear him. He began to eat his\ngrapefruit. Outside, beyond the little metal and plastic housing unit,\nsounds of activity grew. Shouts and muffled crashes, as rural merchants\nand their trucks rumbled along the highway toward Karnet. The reddish\ndaylight swelled; Betelgeuse was rising quietly and majestically.\n\n\"Nice day,\" Tony said. \"No flux wind. I think I'll go down to the\nn-quarter awhile. We're building a neat spaceport, a model, of course,\nbut we've been able to get enough materials to lay out strips for--\"\n\nWith a savage snarl his father reached out and struck the audio roar\nimmediately died. \"I knew it!\" He got up and moved angrily away from the\ntable. \"I told them it would happen. They shouldn't have moved so soon.\nShould have built up Class A supply bases, first.\"\n\n\"Isn't our main fleet moving in from Bellatrix?\" Tony's mother fluttered\nanxiously. \"According to last night's summary the worst that can happen\nis Orion IX and X will be dumped.\"\n\nJoseph Rossi laughed harshly. \"The hell with last night's summary. They\nknow as well as I do what's happening.\"\n\n\"What's happening?\" Tony echoed, as he pushed aside his grapefruit and\nbegan to ladle out dry cereal. \"Are we losing the battle?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" His father's lips twisted. \"Earthmen, losing to--to _beetles_. I\ntold them. But they couldn't wait. My God, there's ten good years left\nin this system. Why'd they have to push on? Everybody knew Orion would\nbe tough. The whole damn beetle fleet's strung out around there. Waiting\nfor us. And we have to barge right in.\"\n\n\"But nobody ever thought beetles would fight,\" Leah Rossi protested\nmildly. \"Everybody thought they'd just fire a few blasts and then--\"\n\n\"They _have_ to fight! Orion's the last jump-off. If they don't fight\nhere, where the hell can they fight?\" Rossi swore savagely. \"Of course\nthey're fighting. We have all their planets except the inner Orion\nstring--not that they're worth much, but it's the principle of the\nthing. If we'd built up strong supply bases, we could have broken up the\nbeetle fleet and really clobbered it.\"\n\n\"Don't say 'beetle,'\" Tony murmured, as he finished his cereal. \"They're\nPas-udeti, same as here. The word 'beetle' comes from Betelgeuse. An\nArabian word we invented ourselves.\"\n\nJoe Rossi's mouth opened and closed. \"What are you, a goddamn\nbeetle-lover?\"\n\n\"Joe,\" Leah snapped. \"For heaven's sake.\"\n\nRossi moved toward the door. \"If I was ten years younger I'd be out\nthere. I'd really show those shiny-shelled insects what the hell they're\nup against. Them and their junky beat-up old hulks. Converted\nfreighters!\" His eyes blazed. \"When I think of them shooting down Terran\ncruisers with _our_ boys in them--\"\n\n\"Orion's their system,\" Tony murmured.\n\n\"_Their_ system! When the hell did you get to be an authority on space\nlaw? Why, I ought to--\" He broke off, choked with rage. \"My own kid,\" he\nmuttered. \"One more crack out of you today and I'll hang one on you\nyou'll feel the rest of the week.\"\n\nTony pushed his chair back. \"I won't be around here today. I'm going\ninto Karnet, with my EEP.\"\n\n\"Yeah, to play with beetles!\"\n\nTony said nothing. He was already sliding his helmet in place and\nsnapping the clamps tight. As he pushed through the back door, into the\nlock membrane, he unscrewed his oxygen tap and set the tank filter into\naction. An automatic response, conditioned by a lifetime spent on a\ncolony planet in an alien system.\n\n\n\nA faint flux wind caught at him and swept yellow-red dust around his\nboots. Sunlight glittered from the metal roof of his family's housing\nunit, one of endless rows of squat boxes set in the sandy slope,\nprotected by the line of ore-refining installations against the horizon.\nHe made an impatient signal, and from the storage shed his EEP came\ngliding out, catching the sunlight on its chrome trim.\n\n\"We're going down into Karnet,\" Tony said, unconsciously slipping into\nthe Pas dialect. \"Hurry up!\"\n\nThe EEP took up its position behind him, and he started briskly down the\nslope, over the shifting sand, toward the road. There were quite a few\ntraders out, today. It was a good day for the market; only a fourth of\nthe year was fit for travel. Betelgeuse was an erratic and undependable\nsun, not at all like Sol (according to the edutapes, fed to Tony four\nhours a day, six days a week--he had never seen Sol himself).\n\nHe reached the noisy road. Pas-udeti were everywhere. Whole groups of\nthem, with their primitive combustion-driven trucks, battered and\nfilthy, motors grinding protestingly. He waved at the trucks as they\npushed past him. After a moment one slowed down. It was piled with\n_tis_, bundled heaps of gray vegetables dried, and prepared for the\ntable. A staple of the Pas-udeti diet. Behind the wheel lounged a\ndark-faced elderly Pas, one arm over the open window, a rolled leaf\nbetween his lips. He was like all other Pas-udeti; lank and\nhard-shelled, encased in a brittle sheath in which he lived and died.\n\n\"You want a ride?\" the Pas murmured--required protocol when an Earthman\non foot was encountered.\n\n\"Is there room for my EEP?\"\n\nThe Pas made a careless motion with his claw. \"It can run behind.\"\nSardonic amusement touched his ugly old face. \"If it gets to Karnet\nwe'll sell it for scrap. We can use a few condensers and relay tubing.\nWe're short on electronic maintenance stuff.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Tony said solemnly, as he climbed into the cabin of the truck.\n\"It's all been sent to the big repair base at Orion I. For your\nwarfleet.\"\n\nAmusement vanished from the leathery face. \"Yes, the warfleet.\" He\nturned away and started up the truck again. In the back, Tony's EEP had\nscrambled up on the load of _tis_ and was gripping precariously with its\nmagnetic lines.\n\nTony noticed the Pas-udeti's sudden change of expression, and he was\npuzzled. He started to speak to him--but now he noticed unusual\nquietness among the other Pas, in the other trucks, behind and in front\nof his own. The war, of course. It had swept through this system a\ncentury ago; these people had been left behind. Now all eyes were on\nOrion, on the battle between the Terran warfleet and the Pas-udeti\ncollection of armed freighters.\n\n\"Is it true,\" Tony asked carefully, \"that you're winning?\"\n\nThe elderly Pas grunted. \"We hear rumors.\"\n\nTony considered. \"My father says Terra went ahead too fast. He says we\nshould have consolidated. We didn't assemble adequate supply bases. He\nused to be an officer, when he was younger. He was with the fleet for\ntwo years.\"\n\nThe Pas was silent a moment. \"It's true,\" he said at last, \"that when\nyou're so far from home, supply is a great problem. We, on the other\nhand, don't have that. We have no distances to cover.\"\n\n\"Do you know anybody fighting?\"\n\n\"I have distant relatives.\" The answer was vague; the Pas obviously\ndidn't want to talk about it.\n\n\"Have you ever seen your warfleet?\"\n\n\"Not as it exists now. When this system was defeated most of our units\nwere wiped out. Remnants limped to Orion and joined the Orion fleet.\"\n\n\"Your relatives were with the remnants?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Then you were alive when this planet was taken?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask?\" The old Pas quivered violently. \"What business is it\nof yours?\"\n\nTony leaned out and watched the walls and buildings of Karnet grow ahead\nof them. Karnet was an old city. It had stood thousands of years. The\nPas-udeti civilization was stable; it had reached a certain point of\ntechnocratic development and then leveled off. The Pas had inter-system\nships that had carried people and freight between planets in the days\nbefore the Terran Confederation. They had combustion-driven cars,\naudiophones, a power network of a magnetic type. Their plumbing was\nsatisfactory and their medicine was highly advanced. They had art forms,\nemotional and exciting. They had a vague religion.\n\n\"Who do you think will win the battle?\" Tony asked.\n\n\"I don't know.\" With a sudden jerk the old Pas brought the truck to a\ncrashing halt. \"This is as far as I go. Please get out and take your\nEEP with you.\"\n\nTony faltered in surprise. \"But aren't you going--?\"\n\n\"No farther!\"\n\nTony pushed the door open. He was vaguely uneasy; there was a hard,\nfixed expression on the leathery face, and the old creature's voice had\na sharp edge he had never heard before. \"Thanks,\" he murmured. He hopped\ndown into the red dust and signaled his EEP. It released its magnetic\nlines, and instantly the truck started up with a roar, passing on inside\nthe city.\n\nTony watched it go, still dazed. The hot dust lapped at his ankles; he\nautomatically moved his feet and slapped at his trousers. A truck\nhonked, and his EEP quickly moved him from the road, up to the level\npedestrian ramp. Pas-udeti in swarms moved by, endless lines of rural\npeople hurrying into Karnet on their daily business. A massive public\nbus had stopped by the gate and was letting off passengers. Male and\nfemale Pas. And children. They laughed and shouted; the sounds of their\nvoices blended with the low hum of the city.\n\n\"Going in?\" a sharp Pas-udeti voice sounded close behind him. \"Keep\nmoving--you're blocking the ramp.\"\n\nIt was a young female, with a heavy armload clutched in her claws. Tony\nfelt embarrassed; female Pas had a certain telepathic ability, part of\ntheir sexual make-up. It was effective on Earthmen at close range.\n\n\"Here,\" she said. \"Give me a hand.\"\n\nTony nodded his head, and the EEP accepted the female's heavy armload.\n\"I'm visiting the city,\" Tony said, as they moved with the crowd toward\nthe gates. \"I got a ride most of the way, but the driver let me off out\nhere.\"\n\n\"You're from the settlement?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe eyed him critically. \"You've always lived here, haven't you?\"\n\n\"I was born here. My family came here from Earth four years before I was\nborn. My father was an officer in the fleet. He earned an Emigration\nPriority.\"\n\n\"So you've never seen your own planet. How old are you?\"\n\n\"Ten years. Terran.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have asked the driver so many questions.\"\n\nThey passed through the decontamination shield and into the city. An\ninformation square loomed ahead; Pas men and women were packed around\nit. Moving chutes and transport cars rumbled everywhere. Buildings and\nramps and open-air machinery; the city was sealed in a protective\ndust-proof envelope. Tony unfastened his helmet and clipped it to his\nbelt. The air was stale-smelling, artificial, but usable.\n\n\"Let me tell you something,\" the young female said carefully, as she\nstrode along the foot-ramp beside Tony. \"I wonder if this is a good day\nfor you to come into Karnet. I know you've been coming here regularly to\nplay with your friends. But perhaps today you ought to stay at home, in\nyour settlement.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because today everybody is upset.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Tony said. \"My mother and father were upset. They were\nlistening to the news from our base in the Rigel system.\"\n\n\"I don't mean your family. Other people are listening, too. These people\nhere. My race.\"\n\n\"They're upset, all right,\" Tony admitted. \"But I come here all the\ntime. There's nobody to play with at the settlement, and anyhow we're\nworking on a project.\"\n\n\"A model spaceport.\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Tony was envious. \"I sure wish I was a telepath. It must\nbe fun.\"\n\nThe female Pas-udeti was silent. She was deep in thought. \"What would\nhappen,\" she asked, \"if your family left here and returned to Earth?\"\n\n\"That couldn't happen. There's no room for us on Earth. C-bombs\ndestroyed most of Asia and North America back in the Twentieth Century.\"\n\n\"Suppose you _had_ to go back?\"\n\nTony did not understand. \"But we can't. Habitable portions of Earth are\novercrowded. Our main problem is finding places for Terrans to live, in\nother systems.\" He added, \"And anyhow, I don't particularly want to go\nto Terra. I'm used to it here. All my friends are here.\"\n\n\"I'll take my packages,\" the female said. \"I go this other way, down\nthis third-level ramp.\"\n\nTony nodded to his EEP and it lowered the bundles into the female's\nclaws. She lingered a moment, trying to find the right words.\n\n\"Good luck,\" she said.\n\n\"With what?\"\n\nShe smiled faintly, ironically. \"With your model spaceport. I hope you\nand your friends get to finish it.\"\n\n\"Of course we'll finish it,\" Tony said, surprised. \"It's almost done.\"\nWhat did she mean?\n\nThe Pas-udeti woman hurried off before he could ask her. Tony was\ntroubled and uncertain; more doubts filled him. After a moment he headed\nslowly into the lane that took him toward the residential section of the\ncity. Past the stores and factories, to the place where his friends\nlived.\n\nThe group of Pas-udeti children eyed him silently as he approached. They\nhad been playing in the shade of an immense _hengelo_, whose ancient\nbranches drooped and swayed with the air currents pumped through the\ncity. Now they sat unmoving.\n\n\"I didn't expect you today,\" B'prith said, in an expressionless voice.\n\nTony halted awkwardly, and his EEP did the same. \"How are things?\" he\nmurmured.\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\n\"I got a ride part way.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nTony squatted down in the shade. None of the Pas children stirred. They\nwere small, not as large as Terran children. Their shells had not\nhardened, had not turned dark and opaque, like horn. It gave them a\nsoft, unformed appearance, but at the same time it lightened their load.\nThey moved more easily than their elders; they could hop and skip\naround, still. But they were not skipping right now.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Tony demanded. \"What's wrong with everybody?\"\n\nNo one answered.\n\n\"Where's the model?\" he asked. \"Have you fellows been working on it?\"\n\nAfter a moment Llyre nodded slightly.\n\nTony felt dull anger rise up inside him. \"Say something! What's the\nmatter? What're you all mad about?\"\n\n\"Mad?\" B'prith echoed. \"We're not mad.\"\n\nTony scratched aimlessly in the dust. He knew what it was. The war,\nagain. The battle going on near Orion. His anger burst up wildly.\n\"Forget the war. Everything was fine yesterday, before the battle.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Llyre said. \"It was fine.\"\n\nTony caught the edge to his voice. \"It happened a hundred years ago.\nIt's not my fault.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" B'prith said.\n\n\"This is my home. Isn't it? Haven't I got as much right here as anybody\nelse? I was born here.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Llyre said, tonelessly.\n\nTony appealed to them helplessly. \"Do you have to act this way? You\ndidn't act this way yesterday. I was here yesterday--all of us were here\nyesterday. What's happened since yesterday?\"\n\n\"The battle,\" B'prith said.\n\n\"What difference does _that_ make? Why does that change everything?\nThere's always war. There've been battles all the time, as long as I can\nremember. What's different about this?\"\n\nB'prith broke apart a clump of dirt with his strong claws. After a\nmoment he tossed it away and got slowly to his feet. \"Well,\" he said\nthoughtfully, \"according to our audio relay, it looks as if our fleet is\ngoing to win, this time.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Tony agreed, not understanding. \"My father says we didn't build\nup adequate supply bases. We'll probably have to fall back to....\" And\nthen the impact hit him. \"You mean, for the first time in a hundred\nyears--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Llyre said, also getting up. The others got up, too. They moved\naway from Tony, toward the near-by house. \"We're winning. The Terran\nflank was turned, half an hour ago. Your right wing has folded\ncompletely.\"\n\nTony was stunned. \"And it matters. It matters to all of you.\"\n\n\"Matters!\" B'prith halted, suddenly blazing out in fury. \"Sure it\nmatters! For the first time--in a century. The first time in our lives\nwe're beating you. We have you on the run, you--\" He choked out the\nword, almost spat it out. \"You white-grubs!\"\n\nThey disappeared into the house. Tony sat gazing stupidly down at the\nground, his hands still moving aimlessly. He had heard the word before,\nseen it scrawled on walls and in the dust near the settlement.\n_White-grubs._ The Pas term of derision for Terrans. Because of their\nsoftness, their whiteness. Lack of hard shells. Pulpy, doughy skin. But\nthey had never dared say it out loud, before. To an Earthman's face.\n\nBeside him, his EEP stirred restlessly. Its intricate radio mechanism\nsensed the hostile atmosphere. Automatic relays were sliding into place;\ncircuits were opening and closing.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Tony murmured, getting slowly up. \"Maybe we'd better\ngo back.\"\n\nHe moved unsteadily toward the ramp, completely shaken. The EEP walked\ncalmly ahead, its metal face blank and confident, feeling nothing,\nsaying nothing. Tony's thoughts were a wild turmoil; he shook his head,\nbut the crazy spinning kept up. He couldn't make his mind slow down,\nlock in place.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" a voice said. B'prith's voice, from the open doorway.\nCold and withdrawn, almost unfamiliar.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nB'prith came toward him, claws behind his back in the formal Pas-udeti\nposture, used between total strangers. \"You shouldn't have come here,\ntoday.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Tony said.\n\nB'prith got out a bit of _tis_ stalk and began to roll it into a tube.\nHe pretended to concentrate on it. \"Look,\" he said. \"You said you have a\nright here. But you don't.\"\n\n\"I--\" Tony murmured.\n\n\"Do you understand why not? You said it isn't your fault. I guess not.\nBut it's not my fault, either. Maybe it's nobody's fault. I've known you\na long time.\"\n\n\"Five years. Terran.\"\n\nB'prith twisted the stalk up and tossed it away. \"Yesterday we played\ntogether. We worked on the spaceport. But we can't play today. My family\nsaid to tell you not to come here any more.\" He hesitated, and did not\nlook Tony in the face. \"I was going to tell you, anyhow. Before they\nsaid anything.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Tony said.\n\n\"Everything that's happened today--the battle, our fleet's stand. We\ndidn't know. We didn't dare hope. You see? A century of running. First\nthis system. Then the Rigel system, all the planets. Then the other\nOrion stars. We fought here and there--scattered fights. Those that got\naway joined up. We supplied the base at Orion--you people didn't know.\nBut there was no hope; at least, nobody thought there was.\" He was\nsilent a moment. \"Funny,\" he said, \"what happens when your back's to the\nwall, and there isn't any further place to go. Then you have to fight.\"\n\n\"If our supply bases--\" Tony began thickly, but B'prith cut him off\nsavagely.\n\n\"Your supply bases! Don't you understand? We're beating you! Now you'll\nhave to get out! All you white-grubs. Out of our system!\"\n\nTony's EEP moved forward ominously. B'prith saw it. He bent down,\nsnatched up a rock, and hurled it straight at the EEP. The rock clanged\noff the metal hull and bounced harmlessly away. B'prith snatched up\nanother rock. Llyre and the others came quickly out of the house. An\nadult Pas loomed up behind them. Everything was happening too fast. More\nrocks crashed against the EEP. One struck Tony on the arm.\n\n\"Get out!\" B'prith screamed. \"Don't come back! This is our planet!\" His\nclaws snatched at Tony. \"We'll tear you to pieces if you--\"\n\nTony smashed him in the chest. The soft shell gave like rubber, and the\nPas stumbled back. He wobbled and fell over, gasping and screeching.\n\n\"_Beetle_,\" Tony breathed hoarsely. Suddenly he was terrified. A crowd\nof Pas-udeti was forming rapidly. They surged on all sides, hostile\nfaces, dark and angry, a rising thunder of rage.\n\nMore stones showered. Some struck the EEP, others fell around Tony, near\nhis boots. One whizzed past his face. Quickly he slid his helmet in\nplace. He was scared. He knew his EEP's E-signal had already gone out,\nbut it would be minutes before a ship could come. Besides, there were\nother Earthmen in the city to be taken care of; there were Earthmen all\nover the planet. In all the cities. On all the twenty-three Betelgeuse\nplanets. On the fourteen Rigel planets. On the other Orion planets.\n\n\"We have to get out of here,\" he muttered to the EEP. \"Do something!\"\n\nA stone hit him on the helmet. The plastic cracked; air leaked out, and\nthen the autoseal filmed over. More stones were falling. The Pas swarmed\nclose, a yelling, seething mass of black-sheathed creatures. He could\nsmell them, the acrid body-odor of insects, hear their claws snap, feel\ntheir weight.\n\nThe EEP threw its heat beam on. The beam shifted in a wide band toward\nthe crowd of Pas-udeti. Crude hand weapons appeared. A clatter of\nbullets burst around Tony; they were firing at the EEP. He was dimly\naware of the metal body beside him. A shuddering crash--the EEP was\ntoppled over. The crowd poured over it; the metal hull was lost from\nsight.\n\nLike a demented animal, the crowd tore at the struggling EEP. A few of\nthem smashed in its head; others tore off struts and shiny arm-sections.\nThe EEP ceased struggling. The crowd moved away, panting and clutching\njagged remains. They saw Tony.\n\nAs the first line of them reached for him, the protective envelope high\nabove them shattered. A Terran scout ship thundered down, heat beam\nscreaming. The crowd scattered in confusion, some firing, some throwing\nstones, others leaping for safety.\n\nTony picked himself up and made his way unsteadily toward the spot where\nthe scout was landing.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Joe Rossi said gently. He touched his son on the shoulder.\n\"I shouldn't have let you go down there today. I should have known.\"\n\nTony sat hunched over in the big plastic easychair. He rocked back and\nforth, face pale with shock. The scout ship which had rescued him had\nimmediately headed back toward Karnet; there were other Earthmen to\nbring out, besides this first load. The boy said nothing. His mind was\nblank. He still heard the roar of the crowd, felt its hate--a century of\npent-up fury and resentment. The memory drove out everything else; it\nwas all around him, even now. And the sight of the floundering EEP, the\nmetallic ripping sound, as its arms and legs were torn off and carried\naway.\n\nHis mother dabbed at his cuts and scratches with antiseptic. Joe Rossi\nshakily lit a cigarette and said, \"If your EEP hadn't been along they'd\nhave killed you. Beetles.\" He shuddered. \"I never should have let you go\ndown there. All this time.... They might have done it any time, any day.\nKnifed you. Cut you open with their filthy goddamn claws.\"\n\nBelow the settlement the reddish-yellow sunlight glinted on gunbarrels.\nAlready, dull booms echoed against the crumbling hills. The defense ring\nwas going into action. Black shapes darted and scurried up the side of\nthe slope. Black patches moved out from Karnet, toward the Terran\nsettlement, across the dividing line the Confederation surveyors had set\nup a century ago. Karnet was a bubbling pot of activity. The whole city\nrumbled with feverish excitement.\n\nTony raised his head. \"They--they turned our flank.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Joe Rossi stubbed out his cigarette. \"They sure did. That was at\none o'clock. At two they drove a wedge right through the center of our\nline. Split the fleet in half. Broke it up--sent it running. Picked us\noff one by one as we fell back. Christ, they're like maniacs. Now that\nthey've got the scent, the taste of our blood.\"\n\n\"But it's getting better,\" Leah fluttered. \"Our main fleet units are\nbeginning to appear.\"\n\n\"We'll get them,\" Joe muttered. \"It'll take a while. But by God we'll\nwipe them out. Every last one of them. If it takes a thousand years.\nWe'll follow every last ship down--we'll get them all.\" His voice rose\nin frenzy. \"Beetles! Goddamn insects! When I think of them, trying to\nhurt my kid, with their filthy black claws--\"\n\n\"If you were younger, you'd be in the line,\" Leah said. \"It's not your\nfault you're too old. The heart strain's too great. You did your job.\nThey can't let an older person take chances. It's not your fault.\"\n\nJoe clenched his fists. \"I feel so--futile. If there was only something\nI could do.\"\n\n\"The fleet will take care of them,\" Leah said soothingly. \"You said so\nyourself. They'll hunt every one of them down. Destroy them all. There's\nnothing to worry about.\"\n\nJoe sagged miserably. \"It's no use. Let's cut it out. Let's stop kidding\nourselves.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Face it! We're not going to win, not this time. We went too far. Our\ntime's come.\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\nTony sat up a little. \"When did you know?\"\n\n\"I've known a long time.\"\n\n\"I found out today. I didn't understand, at first. This is--stolen\nground. I was born here, but it's stolen ground.\"\n\n\"Yes. It's stolen. It doesn't belong to us.\"\n\n\"We're here because we're stronger. But now we're not stronger. We're\nbeing beaten.\"\n\n\"They know Terrans can be licked. Like anybody else.\" Joe Rossi's face\nwas gray and flabby. \"We took their planets away from them. Now they're\ntaking them back. It'll be a while, of course. We'll retreat slowly.\nIt'll be another five centuries going back. There're a lot of systems\nbetween here and Sol.\"\n\nTony shook his head, still uncomprehending. \"Even Llyre and B'prith. All\nof them. Waiting for their time to come. For us to lose and go away\nagain. Where we came from.\"\n\nJoe Rossi paced back and forth. \"Yeah, we'll be retreating from now on.\nGiving ground, instead of taking it. It'll be like this today--losing\nfights, draws. Stalemates and worse.\"\n\nHe raised his feverish eyes toward the ceiling of the little metal\nhousing unit, face wild with passion and misery.\n\n\"But, by God, we'll give them a run for their money.
