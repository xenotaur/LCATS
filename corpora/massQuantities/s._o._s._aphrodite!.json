    "body": "On the high metallic wall across the street was a big sign: VENUS\nTRANSPORT and a smaller sign which read CONTAMINATION AREA--KEEP OUT!\nSteve Coran turned away from the window and faced the ISP official\nacross the desk.\n\n\"From the time you leave this office, you'll be in deadly danger,\" the\nofficial said. \"We aren't dealing with sporadic cases of space piracy.\nThis is a well-organized group of saboteurs, pirates and assassins\nbacked by a ring of powerful and unscrupulous men, some of them in\nhigh places. They have more on their minds than mere looting. They\nhave certain political objectives--and will stop at nothing to cause\nunrest, even war or revolution, to gain their ends. Fishers in troubled\nwaters....\"\n\nCoran laughed harshly. \"Doesn't sound like a rest cure. Why'd you pick\nme for the job?\"\n\nThe official opened a file drawer and riffled the cards. \"You were\nrecommended by the Ministry of Transport. I confess that I was dubious,\nbecause of your record. However, you were transferred from the\nMars-Jupiter sector for the one reason that you're not known here. Any\nof our regular security agents or the ISP men would be recognized at\nonce. Our original idea was to place you aboard a rocket transport as\na crewman to spy out the weak links in our defensive measures. But a\nmatter of graver importance has come up. The assignments will overlap,\nbut we can no longer give you official backing.\"\n\n\"You'd better bring me up to date,\" Coran said bluntly.\n\n\"The pattern is usually the same. Barratry. Three of the Venus\ntransports have been deliberately wrecked and looted. Of plutonium,\nfor the most part. Members of this criminal group have infiltrated\nthe crew. Even trusted officers have been forced, by blackmail or\nother methods, to aid the plotters. We can trust no one, not even the\ncaptain.\"\n\n\"I see. What is this other matter you spoke about?\"\n\n\"Two days ago we arrested a man. The charge was barratry. We had\nno name, only a heliophoto from Venus. In his possession we found\ndocuments relating to political matters of vital importance. Release of\nthe information contained in his portfolio would be disastrous at this\ntime. It could cause chaos, perhaps even war.\"\n\nCoran grunted. \"Such documents have no right to exist.\"\n\n\"I agree. Unfortunately, this one does exist. And it's no longer in\nour custody. A woman, obviously an accomplice, got a blaster-gun to\nhim. Two ISP men were killed, and the prisoner escaped. The documents\nwent with him. I don't have to tell you that both of these fugitives\nmust be apprehended or killed. And those papers must be brought back or\ndestroyed. That's your job.\"\n\n\"I don't like it.\"\n\n\"Tact isn't your long suit, is it, Lieutenant? You weren't asked if you\nliked it. With two black marks against your record, you can't afford\nan opinion. One more and you're through as an officer in the space\npatrol--\"\n\n\"I don't like working out of uniform.\"\n\n\"--and I wouldn't count too much on a friendship with Paul Jomian, if I\nwere you, Coran. He's through here ... even if he was kicked upstairs\ninto the transport ministry. We no longer approve his methods. His\nrough-shod, undisciplined methods may get by in a frontier civilization\nlike that of the outer planets, but nowadays we require efficiency and\ncomplete co-operation in the ISP. The time is past when an ISP officer\ncan forget to change his uniform and go without shaving for days at a\ntime.\"\n\nCoran's eyes glittered. \"There was more to Paul Jomian than gold braid\nand pretty uniforms. He was a man. And he got things done so a lot\nof you pretty-boys could sit on your fat chairs and keep your hair\nunmussed. For your information, those black marks on my record are for\ntearing apart superior officers who made cracks about Paul Jomian. Do\nyou want me to turn in my badge?\"\n\nThe official smiled poisonously. \"That would be the easy way out for\nyou, Coran. What's the matter--the job too tough for you?\"\n\n\"I can't stand the smell of perfume around here. And the jobs don't\ncome too tough. Relax, big shot. I'll run your stinking little errand\nfor you. But it's the last one. When I hand your two-vikdal bad man\nover to you, I'm through. Make out my resignation that way, and I'll\nsign it before I leave.\"\n\n\n\nThe official laughed and stood up. \"Resignation accepted--upon\ncompletion of assignment. You're a hard case, Coran. Up to a point,\nyou're even right. But you don't belong any more, not in this part of\nthe universe. It took pioneers like you and Jomian to bang the holes in\nour fishbowl world, but we need men with dull routine minds to bring\norder into it. Unofficially, I'm sorry to see you go. Nowadays a man\nconforms or he gets out.\"\n\n\"Skip the bouquets and the funeral oration. What's the layout on the\njob you want done?\"\n\nThe official threw a file card across the desk. \"There's the man you\nwant. The picture won't help you much, since he'll probably be wearing\na plastic face-mask.\"\n\nCoran glanced at it and shrugged. \"Not much to go on. Any other leads?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The official glanced at his wrist-chron. \"We know that he will\nbe on the Venus transport X-1143--the _Aphrodite_--which leaves in\nthree hours. Probably the woman, too. Whatever happens, they must not\nreach Venus alive.\"\n\n\n\nCoran caught an implication in the words. \"What do you mean 'Whatever\nhappens?'\"\n\n\"The _Aphrodite_ is an emigrant ship. It's a government secret that\nshe's carrying plutonium for the power plants on Venus, but we're\nafraid the information may have leaked out. You may as well know that\nwe're on the spot. It's too late to cancel the shipment without serious\neconomic repercussions. And we haven't found any way to protect the\npassenger-carrying ships. Even if we armed them, which is against\nInterplanetary Law, they're too slow to run and too unwieldy to\nmaneuver. Too much mass.\"\n\n\"What about convoy?\"\n\n\"We tried that last time. The ship was disabled and driven off-orbit.\nThen a group of fast cruisers of unusual design showed up. The space\npatrol drove them off and gave chase. It was a trick, of course, to\ndecoy our ships into space, then the main body of pirates moved in and\ncleaned out the ship.\"\n\nCoran laughed. \"When you're catching rabbits you have to be smarter\nthan the rabbits.\"\n\nThe official flushed. \"We're handicapped by lack of ships and lack\nof competent personnel. This is your chance to be smarter than the\nrabbits. The man you want is obviously a member of the same group. If\nthere is trouble, he will try to contact his friends. It's up to you\nto find him first, and if you fail that, to make sure that he does not\nescape or turn over the documents to anyone else. We'll have an ISP\nsquadron following six hours behind the _Aphrodite_. If you need help,\nget a signal to them--by helioflash, if you can. I suggest you find the\nman first, and through him, locate the woman. From there on, you know\nwhat to do....\"\n\n\"It's a dirty job. Even with frosting, it's simple butchery--no trial,\nno evidence. Now I know why the Martians consider an ISP man just a\nhired thug.\"\n\n\"That's all he is. You have your orders and, whatever your private\nopinions may be, I'm sure you'll agree that lives are unimportant when\nwe're playing for such stakes.\"\n\n\"Lives never are when politicians start dealing from the bottom of the\ndeck,\" Coran snarled bitterly.\n\nThe official shrugged. \"I wouldn't know about that. I'm just a yes-man.\nYou can discuss it with Paul Jomian--your politician friend--when you\nsee him. He'll be on the _Aphrodite_.\"\n\n\"Have you figured out how I'm to get on the _Aphrodite_? If she's\nan emigrant ship, they'll take only married couples. The altruistic\nCompany wants settlers to colonize Venus and build up their plague-spot\nplantations for them.\"\n\n\"That's your problem. Marry someone if you have to, or hire a fake\nwife. It's been done. Anything, just so you don't give away your\nofficial position. Now get going. You've less than three hours till\ntake-off time.\"\n\nCoran bent over the desk and signed his resignation with an elaborate\nflourish, put an inked thumbprint beside the name, then stalked to the\ndoor clothespinning his nose between thumb and forefinger. \"That's time\nenough to blow this stink off me,\" he said carelessly, wiping the inky\nthumb on his uniform jacket.\n\nThe official laughed. \"You're right. It does stink.\"\n\n\n\nSteve Coran was conscious of the girl merely as an obstacle between\nhim and the ticket window. She was young, expensively dressed and too\nwell-groomed, with blue-white hair, a haughty manner, and an icy stare\nin her violet eyes.\n\n\"I was here first,\" she said coldly.\n\nCoran bowed mockingly. \"I don't like you either. Besides, I never hit\na lady in public. I hope this won't lead to one of those shipboard\nromances.\"\n\nThe beehive activity of the ticket office slackened as take-off time\ndrew near. Coran studied her back as she stood ahead of him in the line\nand repressed a desire to pinch her and find out if she were real. The\nweasel-faced clerk was tired and his tone of long-suffering patience\nhad worn to a thread of annoyance.\n\n\"I've told you before, miss. I can't sell single tickets--the company\nrules do not permit any but married couples aboard an emigrant\ntransport. We feel that unattached women are trouble makers in a\nfrontier society.\"\n\nThe girl made an arrogant gesture. \"It's important. I must get to\nVenus. I don't care what it costs.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me. See the manager. I don't make the rules. Third office\non the left. But you'd better hurry. I've only one double passage left.\"\n\nCoran tapped the girl on her shoulder. She glared at him. \"Take a tip\nfrom me, babe. See the boss. If he's a man, you'll get the tickets.\"\n\nAs she left the line, he pushed to the window. \"I'll take those two\ntickets, bud.\"\n\n\"Do you have your marriage certificate?\"\n\nCoran reached through the window, snagged a coat lapel and had the man\ndragged half through the window in a flash. \"Now I'll talk, punk, and\nyou listen. Because I don't have a ring in my nose, don't get the idea\nI'm not married. Do I get those tickets, or do you give up mirrors for\nthe next six weeks?\"\n\nThe clerk looked at the gnarled fist under his nose and gave a wild nod\nof his head. \"You get them.\"\n\nThe steel fingers relaxed and the clerk slid back inside his cage.\n\"I'll report this,\" he stormed, shaking himself like a wet animal.\n\"You'd better have your papers when you try to get past the purser.\" He\nhanded out the tickets.\n\nThe girl followed Coran from the office. \"I'll give you a thousand\nvikdals for those tickets.\"\n\nCoran grinned savagely. \"Not even if you said please.\"\n\n\"Please, and two thousand.\"\n\n\"Stop it--you're getting near my price. Besides, they wouldn't do you\nany good. You need a husband to go with 'em. Take the express rocket\nnext month. It's a shorter orbit and you'll only lose two weeks.\"\n\n\"You take it then. My business won't wait. Three thousand.\"\n\nCoran whistled. \"What's your problem?\"\n\n\"None of your business.\"\n\n\"Have it your own way. My business won't wait either. Now, if you don't\nmind, I'm in a hurry. I've less than two hours to find a honky-tonk and\nget myself a bride. I don't suppose you'd know where the nearest dive\nis. No, you wouldn't.\"\n\nHe turned away toward the elevators, but the girl clutched his arm\ndesperately. \"Six thousand.... It's all I have.\"\n\nCoran stared at her. \"I'm sorry for you, but you'd have to kill me to\nget these away. And I'm hard to kill. I'll make a deal though. I'll\nsell you half of my double for three thousand. You'd have to marry me,\nthough.\"\n\n\"_Marry you!_\" There was a word of loathing in her tone.\n\n\"It's been done. I'm on my way out now to look up a floozy. I'll even\nmarry her, if she's dope enough to want it that way. I don't like the\nidea any better than you do, but I'd hock grandma's false teeth to get\nto Venus. Forget I mentioned it. If I'm to be stuck with a dame for\nfour months, it might as well be a flamethrower as an icicle.\"\n\nHe buzzed for the elevator before she called after him. \"I--I've\nchanged my mind.\" She was pale, with a look of suppressed fury about\nher. \"I guess I'd do even that.\"\n\nCoran laughed wickedly. \"Don't flatter yourself. You're just a ticket\nto Venus to me. Meet me at the marriage bureau in half an hour. We\nhaven't much time, and you'll have to be psychographed. We really\nshould know each other. I'm Steve Coran.\"\n\n\"I'm Gerda Mors. In half an hour.\"\n\n\n\nThe purser stopped at a door marked No. 200. He was a young,\ninadequate-looking man.\n\n\"You won't have to carry me over the threshold,\" Gerda said crisply.\nShe went inside and shut the door. In shocked silence, he re-checked\nthe sheaf of papers in his hand.\n\n\"She's shy around strangers,\" Coran explained. \"When do we take-off?\"\n\n\"In five minutes. We're making these emigrant runs under very crowded\nconditions. All passengers are expected to remain in their own\nstaterooms most of the time. A certain amount of exercise is permitted,\nof course, once free flight is attained and the A-orbit corrections\nmade. Until then, we recommend that everyone remain out of the crew's\nway. The safest place during acceleration is in bed.\"\n\nCoran winked ponderously. \"I'll make out all right. One thing, though.\nI believe I have a friend on board. Am I permitted to examine the\npassenger lists?\"\n\n\"Of course, they're public property. See the captain. His office is up\nnear the bow, just aft of the control rooms. But wait till we're out in\nspace.\"\n\nCoran knocked and entered the stateroom. Gerda was brushing her hair.\nShe glanced up irritably. \"This is my room,\" she told him shortly.\n\"Find yourself another.\"\n\nHe laughed grimly. \"The psychographs warned we were incompatible, but\nyou'd better get used to me. It's 146 days to Venus, and we've only\nthis stateroom between us. They practically lock us in, you know. We're\ngoing to be very good friends or most uncomfortable before we reach\nVenus.\"\n\nAngry sparks shot from her violet eyes. \"Did you know all this before?\"\n\nCoran nodded.\n\n\"You are a swine, aren't you? It won't do you any good. I'll tell the\ncaptain we're not married. I'll say it was all a fake, the certificate\nwas a forgery, that you're a....\"\n\n\"Go ahead. I wish for your sake it would help, but they'd only check\nand find out it was genuine. Even if it weren't, you'd only be forced\nto go through the ceremony again. The rules are very specific to cover\njust such situations.\"\n\nFear and anger blended unpleasantly in her voice. \"I'll think of\nsomething....\"\n\nWarning alarms blared through the ship. Ripples of soundless shock\nstirred the bulk.\n\n\"We're getting under way,\" Coran warned. \"You'd better come to bed.\"\n\n\"I'd rather die,\" she said sullenly.\n\n\"Suit yourself. But it's pretty unpleasant.\"\n\n\n\nThe rocket transport left its runway at an angle of 45 degrees,\nslanting up into the Sahara night with a blossom of pink-white flame\nflowering round its stern jets. A series of jarring vibrations smoothed\nto a muffled burr. The girl was flung heavily to the floor and lay\nthere beside the porthole of fused quartz, retching feebly as the\nacceleration built up. Outside the port, what seemed the flank of a\ntitanic mountain of moonlit sand fell rapidly astern. It tilted at an\nincredible angle.\n\nCoran hunched himself off the bed and crawled to her. Gerda grimaced\nweakly and struck at him, then lapsed into unconsciousness. He picked\nher up and carried her to the bed, dumped her like a limp sack and\nclasped the straps about her. She did not rouse.\n\nHer purse lay where she had dropped it. Coran went through it\nmethodically. A small blaster-gun of the type women thugs carry\nin their handbags. It appeared to have been used recently. Four\nLumipencils. The usual cosmetics. A pillbox with a poison label. And,\nin an ivory frame, a small colorphoto miniature of the man whose face\nwas on the Security Headquarters dossier card. Coran neutralized the\ncharge in the blaster and set it on safety, then carefully replaced\neverything. He wished he had a pocket magnascope to study the miniature\nin detail, but that could wait. He must check the passenger lists and\nfind out where Paul Jomian's room was located. Paul should be warned,\nso that his surprise at seeing Coran would not give the show away.\n\nThe girl stirred and moaned feebly. Coran found the emergency\nmedical locker and forced an anti-acceleration capsule between her\ntight-clenched teeth, following it with a water concentrate capsule.\nShe would be wildly thirsty when she came out of it, and real water\nwould have some unpleasant effects during A-shock. He leaned over and\nchecked the straps. They were tight enough so she would never get out\nof that tie without help. Her eyes blinked open and she stared at him\nin panic.\n\n\"Just relax,\" he cautioned. \"And don't get impatient. I'll be right\nback. Have to see a man about a....\"\n\nHe went outside and made his way with difficulty up the bleak passage\nforward. The distorted gravity made walking extremely difficult. Once\noutside the main gravity field of Earth, artificial gravities would be\nturned on. Until then, only an experienced spaceman could get around\nsafely. Coran was grateful for the rigorous training of the ISP.\n\nA staccato bark of unintelligible verbal commands came through the\nhalf-opened doorway of the control room ahead. The captain's office\nshould be somewhere about here. On Coran's right was a closed door\nmarked CAPTAIN. Coran knocked twice without receiving any answer,\nthen tried the door. It slid easily open. He stepped over the high\nthreshold. Lights were flaring and dying away as if the generators were\nrunning unevenly. He peered about him, and at first the Spartan-like\naccommodations seemed unoccupied. He wondered if he should sit down and\nwait for the captain. A second look convinced him he would have a long\nwait.\n\nSprawled forward, half across the desk, was the captain's body. The\nupper part of his head had been blown away by a blaster-gun, evidently\nfired at close quarters.\n\nA cry behind him swung Coran around. In the frame of the opened doorway\nstood the purser, mouth open, pointing at the dead man with a trembling\nfinger. Instinctively, Coran started for the door. The purser sprang\ninto action, leaped on Coran and caught him in a surprisingly strong\ngrip for so slight a man. Coran made no attempt to struggle. In a\nmoment the office was full of people. The burly first mate pulled the\npurser away from Coran.\n\n\"What is all this, Hamlin?\" the mate demanded.\n\nCoran had taken time to study the identification files on all\nthe _Aphrodite's_ officers at headquarters before coming aboard.\nHe recognized the three officers instantly as Harriman, first\nmate--Hamlin, the purser--and Nalson, the navigator or astronaut--but\nwas careful not to give himself away.\n\n\"I heard a sound in the captain's office, and when I came in to\ninvestigate, I found him,\" Hamlin explained. \"The captain's been\nmurdered.\"\n\nMate Harriman looked Coran up and down. \"Where's the gun?\" he asked.\n\n\"How should I know? I just came in a minute ago. He was like this when\nI got here.\"\n\nHarriman drove a fist into Coran's mouth. \"Come now, you don't expect\nus to believe a yarn like that. Where is that gun?\"\n\nCoran spat blood from his mangled lips. \"I don't know anything about\nit. The purser can tell you why I wanted to see the captain.\"\n\nHamlin spoke up. \"I told him to wait till we were out in space,\" he\nsnapped. \"He said he wanted to check the passenger list.\"\n\n\"I demand to see the first mate,\" Coran said.\n\nThe words seemed to recall Harriman to his duties. \"I am the first\nmate,\" he said. \"I haven't time to bother with you now. I'll take care\nof you later. Throw him in the cells till we get out in space. I'll\nhave to take over for the Old Man.\"\n\n\n\nCoran was hustled roughly to the lower part of the ship and flung into\nthe cramped quarters of the transport's brig. He settled back on the\nbunk and tried to straighten things out in his mind.\n\n\"At least I got a room to myself,\" he mused grimly. This was going to\ncomplicate things.\n\nHis wrist-chron had stopped, so he had no way of telling time, but they\nfed him four times and he slept twice before they came for him. Two\ncrew men waited in the passage while Hamlin came in and sat down.\n\n\"You're in a bad spot, Coran. It's customary in cases of civilian\ninfractions of ship's rules to appoint an officer as counsel for their\ndefense. I'm yours. Sorry you got pushed around, but you were lucky\nat that. Harriman's a pretty tough character. You'd have got worse if\nNalson and I hadn't been there. He's been disciplined for brutality\nbefore now. They're giving you a hearing in the wardroom. I'd suggest\nyou co-operate with me by telling me anything that will help with your\ncase. I don't mind telling you your story's too weak to hold up. I'll\ndo all I can for you, but you'll have to help.\"\n\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" Coran grunted.\n\n\"You might tell me the truth. We know the captain must have been killed\njust as the ship took off. Otherwise, someone would have heard the\nshot. If you could prove you were somewhere else at the time--\"\n\n\"I was with my wife. She'll bear witness for me.\"\n\n\"It won't do, Coran. I should have told you that your wife is ill and\nwon't be able to testify. I found her myself, strapped to the bunk in\nyour cabin, Martian plague! I called the doctor who examined her, then\nquarantined the cabin. We left concentrated food and water, warned her\nnot to leave, then locked and sealed the cabin. No one can see her.\"\n\nCoran went cold with anger. \"Someone must really be trying to foul me\nup,\" he raged. \"She couldn't have the plague--she's never been off the\nearth.\"\n\n\"Your papers read that you just came from Mars,\" objected Hamlin.\n\n\"I did. We were married just before the ship left. If I were carrying\nthe plague, I'd have it myself. She couldn't have it--\"\n\nHamlin laughed nervously. \"I wish you could convince the doctor of\nthat. He's been taking blood tests of me ever since we left her. I'm\nsorry for you, Coran, but she has it. I saw the grey rash myself. It's\nhorrible, horrible....\"\n\nCoran's mind worked like lightning. She had said she would think of\nsomething. Something to keep the stateroom to herself. There might even\nbe a more sinister motive than that. After that picture of the man\nhe wanted in her purse, he could believe anything of her. Maybe she\neven knew about him. She was faking, but how? How, since she had been\nsecurely tied when he left her? Had he started his quest at the wrong\nend? She must have been the woman accomplice who had got a gun through\nthe security police guarding the prisoner.\n\n\"What am I charged with?\" he asked.\n\n\"Deliberate murder and plotting against the welfare of the ship. If the\nofficers agree on your guilt, you can be put to death immediately. They\nput you through an airlock. The regulations have to be pretty stringent\non a space-ship.\"\n\nCoran stood up. \"Let's go up and get it over with,\" he said. \"We'll see\nabout your regulations.\"\n\nManacled between the two brawny crewmen, a sullen Coran rode up in\nthe elevators. Outside the wardroom, the group stopped while Hamlin\nknocked. \"I wish you'd let me help you,\" he said in a final attempt.\n\nCoran shook his head. \"I know what I'm doing.\"\n\nHamlin shrugged. \"I hope you do.\"\n\n\n\nThe assembled officers stared at Coran curiously. His lip was still\nbruised and swollen. He stared insolently at the group and tried to\nthrust all other considerations out of his mind. The girl and his quest\nwould have to wait. His immediate hurdle was to get out of this mess.\n\nHarriman wet his lips and opened the hearing.\n\n\"I won't waste words when we all know why we're here. There is no need\nfor formality in a hearing of this kind. The captain of the _Aphrodite_\nwas foully murdered, and this man who calls himself Stephen Coran was\nfound standing over his body. There was no gun in the room and none on\nthe prisoner. Coran's papers seem to be in order. They show him to be a\nprospector from Mars, en route to Venus, but may be forgeries. That can\nbe checked. His wife is in quarantine, and will be unable to testify\none way or the other.\"\n\nCoran broke in. \"I demand to hear the formal charge against me.\"\n\n\"As acting captain of the _Aphrodite_, I officially charge you, Stephen\nCoran, with the wilful murder of Captain Joseph Shalm, late master of\nthis ship. Also, since the murder must have taken place at the exact\nmoment of take-off, with the deliberate intent to delay and endanger\nthe safety of the ship and all the lives on board.\"\n\n\"Good. Now I make formal demand that my wife be called as witness to\nthe fact that I could not have been in the captain's office at the time\nof take-off.\"\n\n\"You heard me say that your wife is in quarantine. She will not be able\nto testify. If you have anything else to say in your defense, speak up.\"\n\n\"I make no defense. Since the court is so obviously prejudiced, I\nwill stand on my civilian rights as a technicality. This court has no\njurisdiction over me. The most you can do is to confine me to the area\nof this ship until a charge can be brought against me in the admiralty\ncourt on Venus. Also, under Security Law No. F 1720, since the one\nwitness I asked to have called in my defense has not been brought to\ncourt, I demand that the whole proceedings be dropped as illegal,\nunjustified, and prejudicial to civilian rights. Since I obviously\ncannot escape from the ship, you cannot even require the customary bond\nfor reappearance.\"\n\nHarriman's mouth dropped open. \"Do you expect to get away with this?\"\n\n\"More than that.\" Coran grimaced unpleasantly. \"I wish to file charges\nwith the nearest official of the ministry of transport that I was\nmishandled and held under restraint without formal charges being\nbrought against me. If there is such an official on board, I demand to\nsee him.\"\n\nNalson, the astronaut, hid a smile behind his sleeve, then leaned\nforward and whispered earnestly to Harriman. Harriman nodded, then\nturned to consult with the ship's doctor.\n\n\"Is this your doing, Hamlin?\" the acting captain rasped sourly.\n\nThe purser shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. But, since the prisoner chooses\nthis defense, I have no choice but to repeat his demands, officially.\nThere is an official aboard, Paul Jomian of the transport ministry. I\nsuggest you send for him and turn this hearing over to him. He will\nhave whatever authority is necessary to deal with it.\"\n\nIn momentary desperation, Harriman glanced round the room at the circle\nof faces and saw that Coran had him over a barrel. The hard-faced\nnavigator, Nalson, spoke up. \"Better send for Jomian. In theory,\nwe have the right of assessing the death penalty, but in practice,\nit's not so simple. The admiralty will review the case and, if your\nfoot slips on some technicality, you might even have to face the\ndisintegrators yourself.\"\n\nHarriman gave in and sent for Jomian.\n\n\n\nA red bulb flashed and the buzzer sounded, then Paul Jomian stepped\ninto the wardroom. He was a lean man, greying into his late fifties,\nwith the bleakness of outer space in his eyes and a face badly scarred\nby spaceburns. His eyes stared as they fell upon the manacled figure of\nCoran standing in the center of the harsh-lit stage. Steve Coran stared\nback at him with insolently expressionless face.\n\nThe difficulty was rapidly explained by Captain Harriman in a\nmonotonously leveled tone of repressed fury. Jomian studied the\nprisoner with politely casual interest while the harangue went on. When\nHarriman finished, the transport official considered briefly before\ngiving his verdict.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, much as I sympathize with your feelings in this\nmatter, I'm afraid the prisoner is within his rights. Even if the\ncircumstances are somewhat unusual, we have no choice but to release\nhim. However, in view of the possible menace involved to the safety of\nthe ship, I recommend that he be under constant surveillance by some\ncompetent and responsible officer, preferably the one appointed for his\ndefense, who will see to it that he has no opportunity to perpetrate\nfurther violence. Once Venus is reached the man can be turned over to\nthe proper authorities.\"\n\nCoran broke in roughly. \"Does all this monkey talk mean I'm free?\"\n\nHarriman was maliciously official. \"I'm afraid it does. But don't try\nanything funny. Hamlin, Nalson, I'm detailing you two to watch over\nCoran in shifts. Don't let him out of your sight, day or night. If\nhe attempts to steal a lifeboat and escape, or makes the slightest\nuntoward move to hinder the operation of the ship or molest anyone on\nboard, shoot him--that's all. Since he has no room, he will share yours\nfor the remainder of the voyage.\"\n\nHamlin got a key and released Coran from his manacles.\n\nJomian glanced at him with an odd expression. \"If you don't mind,\nCoran, I'd like a word with you in private. If the captain has no\nobjection.\"\n\nHarriman was curious, but nodded. \"Are you sure you'll be safe with\nhim?\"\n\nJomian smiled. \"That's my worry. Send your men to my cabin in an hour.\nAfter twelve years in the Space Patrol, I'm used to handling bad boys.\"\n\n\n\nNine days out the _Aphrodite_ ran into trouble.\n\nProximity alarms blared wildly. It was only a small asteroid, not more\nthan a quarter of a mile in diameter, just a jagged piece of rock and\nfused metal. But it came out of a direct line with the sun, moving\nfast, and discipline had been dangerously lax on the _Aphrodite_ after\nHarriman took over command.\n\nAt 9:05 ship time, there came the sound of a rending crash up forward,\nfollowed by a nauseating sense of shock and withering waves of motion\nenergy transformed into heat. Fortunately, the collision was a glancing\none, but enough. The _Aphrodite_ was a shattered wreck. Her bow and\nthe control room were carried away bodily, and only the spacetight\nbulkheads of the waist saved the passengers and crew from instant death.\n\nAt 9:20, feeling far off course, leaking air dangerously from sprung\nseams, the doomed transport and the asteroid circled each other like\nwary wrestlers awaiting an opening. Sooner or later, as the initial\nforce of the spin died down, they would crash together in flaming\nholocaust. In the meantime, everything that could be done was being\ndone.\n\nOrders went out to abandon ship. Of the original complement of four\nhundred and eighty passengers and crew, nineteen were dead or missing,\nand eighty others more or less seriously injured. The heaviest\ncasualties were among the rocket crew and officers, some of whom were\nfatally burned by premature atomic discharge. Rocket jets were set\nroaring at full capacity in a vain effort to break the wreck away\nfrom the deadly vicinity of the circling asteroid. Surviving crew\nmembers labored heroically to load and launch the lifeboats from three\nairlocks, two of which were so badly jammed as to be almost unworkable.\n\nThe forward compartments were a scene from inferno. Coran, who had been\nwith Nalson in the chartroom when the crash occurred, picked himself\nout of the jumble of broken lockers and scattered metal-leaf charts\nand crawled through the glare and heat to a pitiable huddle of pulped\nflesh pinned beneath the wreckage of a berylium table. Nalson's skull\nwas fractured, blood pulsed from his ears, and he was gasping out his\nlife as Coran pried the table off him. His eyes seemed bursting from\nhis head.\n\n\"No excuse for wreck,\" he got out. \"I'm ... Security Police. Sent me in\ncase you fumbled. Watch Harriman ... Hamlin.\"\n\nA spurt of blood from his mouth and nose stopped his words. The\nnavigator spat savagely. \"Think ... Hamlin's ... the man you want.\" His\nlips moved weakly, then hung open as he died.\n\n\n\nUsing a leg of the ruined table as a wrecking bar, Coran pried open the\ndoor and got into the passageway. A blast of sickening heat rushed to\nmeet him. Forward was a lurid glare of white hot metal, and he could\nhear air shrieking through the leaks where seams had started. He fought\nhis way aft to a bank of elevators, but they were hopelessly jammed.\n\nDescending the spiral stairway, he encountered Paul Jomian.\n\n\"I thought you were gone,\" Jomian said. \"The entire forward part of the\nship seems to be carried away.\"\n\n\"It is. I'm hard to kill. Nalson's dead. And so are the men in the\ncontrol room.\"\n\nA kind of exhilaration moved in Coran. The endless waiting and\nwatching, under constant surveillance, had gotten on his nerves. He\nwas not used to intrigue. Now that a need for his kind of action had\narisen, he felt better already.\n\nJomian's left arm had compound fractures above and below the elbow.\nIt hung useless at his side, with splinters of bone thrusting through\nmangled skin and flesh. Coran broke open a locker and gave him\nemergency first aid, binding the limb with metal splints.\n\n\"That'll hold it till you can get it cared for. You'd better get to the\nlifeboats. I'm going to find my wife. As I told you, she may be in this\nracket, but I can't be sure. In any case, she's my responsibility.\"\n\n\"Can't I help?\" Jomian asked.\n\n\"Not now. If I make it, we'll discuss it there. If not, you can take\na message for me. There's an ISP squadron six hours behind us. Get a\nhelioflash to them. Tell them to come a-running. I've an idea they'll\nfind something interesting.\"\n\n\"I'll get word to them,\" Jomian promised. \"Take care of yourself, boy.\"\n\nThe door of stateroom No. 200 was still locked and sealed. Coran opened\na locker and got out a wrench to work off the lugs on the lock. A voice\nfrom behind jarred him.\n\n\"I've been looking for you,\" Hamlin sneered. \"I thought you'd be up\nto something.\" In the dimming and flaring light, Coran got a glimpse\nof the blaster-gun in Hamlin's hand. Coran's fingers tightened on the\nwrench. He spun around and hurled the wrench in one motion. Hamlin\npressed the trigger, but the wrench spoiled his aim. Coran dodged under\nthe gun and dragged him down in a flying tackle. The gun went rattling\ndown the corridor.\n\n\"Come away from there, you fool,\" Hamlin screamed as he broke away.\n\"D'you want the plague?\" He edged toward the gun, but Coran cut him\noff. Both lunged for it. Coran got it, but before he could use it,\nHamlin kicked him in the stomach. He rolled on the floor in agony.\nHamlin kicked again viciously. Coran fumbled with the gun.\n\nA warning alarm sounded. The boats were about to leave.\n\nCoran got his breath back. \"Help me get her out. She has no more plague\nthan you have. Besides, she's your--\"\n\n\"You're mad,\" Hamlin shrieked. \"They'd never let her into the boats.\nI won't risk the lives of innocent people on your sayso.\" He leaned\nacross Coran to snatch at the gun. Coran clawed at his face and layers\nof plastic came off in his fingers. Hamlin screamed as the stuff came\nloose from his flesh. Then he turned and ran.\n\nHe darted up the companion stairs. By the time Coran could reach the\ngun, it was too late. The man had vanished to the upper deck.\n\nCoran got to his knees and aimed the blaster at the jammed lock on the\nstateroom door. The mechanism and half the door disappeared in ravening\nviolence. The shock knocked Coran flat.\n\nGerda stepped through the shattered doorway.\n\n\"What's going on?\" she wailed hysterically. It was apparent that she\nhad been crying, although she had tried to efface the marks.\n\n\"Never mind that. We've got to get you out of here. Are you all right?\"\n\nShe laughed wildly. \"Of course I am! Has everyone gone crazy? You look\na fright. D'you want to carry me, or should I carry you?\"\n\n\"Get to the lower decks. Find the doctor. Show him you're not sick.\nAnd hurry--the lifeboats are leaving.\" Coran made a vague gesture and\nslumped weakly against the wall while spirals of nausea raged through\nhim. She was halfway to the companion stair before she noticed that he\nwas not following. Coran had fainted.\n\n\n\nCold water splashing in his face revived him. His head was nestled in\nher lap.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" he raged. \"If you don't hurry, it will be\ntoo late.\"\n\nShe answered with quiet assurance. \"Listen, tough guy, you didn't have\nto come back for me. D'you think I'd leave you to save my skin after\nthat?\"\n\nCoran shook his head to clear the mist of dizzy weakness, and she\nhelped him to his feet.\n\n\"Let's get going,\" he urged. \"If the lifeboats leave before we reach\nthe airlock, you'll really be in a jam.\"\n\nWith the girl's arm tight around his waist to support him, he managed\nto make it to the sally-port. The airlock door was closed.\n\n\"The boats have gone,\" he said. He sat down hopelessly on a casket-like\nmetal toolbox.\n\n\"Maybe someone will come,\" she said.\n\n\"That's what I'm afraid of,\" he snapped.\n\n\"In the meantime, I think we need some coffee ... if I can find an\nunopened can.\"\n\nCoran waved toward a locker where supplies were kept on clipshelves.\nShe found a can with built-in heat unit and opened it, pouring coffee\nfor them. He sipped his slowly, while she gulped down a scalding draft.\n\n\"You seem very calm about all this,\" Coran said grimly.\n\n\"Hysterics won't help. Besides, you seem to be expecting someone. What\ndid you mean, that's what you're afraid of? Who would come back?\"\n\n\"Don't you know?\"\n\nShe shook her head in bewilderment \"How should I know? I'm a stranger\nhere myself.\"\n\n\"You may as well stop playing innocent. In case you don't already know,\nI'm an officer in the space patrol. This wreck was deliberate, planned\nby some of the crew. There are two possibilities. Either they'll come\nback and try to salvage the plutonium cargo, or they have confederates\nwaiting in space to close in as soon as the ship is abandoned. I don't\nlook forward to either one.\"\n\n\"You act as if I knew something about all this,\" Gerda said irritably.\n\"I don't know why you should think so, but you're way off the track.\nWhy suspect me?\"\n\n\"How can I help it, with that picture in your purse, and that phoney\ndeal you pulled by playing sick?\"\n\nGerda flushed, whether from anger or guilt Coran would have given much\nto know.\n\n\"I don't know how you know about that,\" she answered evenly. \"I--I\ncan't explain about the picture, but the other I had nothing to do\nwith. While you had me tied up, someone came into the room; naturally\nI thought it was you coming back. I was still dazed from shock and\nonly half awake. First thing I knew, a man in uniform had jammed a\npillow over my face. I thought he was trying to kill me, and nearly\nsmothered. He rubbed something on my elbows and down the cords of my\nneck, then left. It seemed like a nightmare. I blamed you vaguely till\nI remembered the gold braid on his sleeves and knew it must have been\na ship's officer. Later, an officer came in with the doctor, who took\none look at me and seemed scared to death. Too scared to examine me.\nThey wouldn't listen to anything, just untied me enough so I could work\nloose eventually, left some stuff, and locked me in. That's all I knew\ntill you let me out just now.\"\n\n\n\nCoran considered. \"It sounds plausible. I'd like to believe you, but\nthat photograph is too damning. You'll have a lot of explaining to\ndo ... if we get out of this alive.\"\n\n\"What about the photograph? What's he wanted for?\"\n\n\"There's another one of him in the Security Police headquarters. He's\nthe man I was sent to get. Both ISP and the Security Police want him.\nThe original charge was barratry, but--\"\n\n\"What's barratry?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's the deliberate wrecking of a ship, for the insurance or to\nsalvage the cargo illegally. I don't know what your connection is with\nthis man, but--\"\n\n\"It's very simple,\" she said. \"He's my brother. I knew he was in\ntrouble, but didn't know it was so serious. Our family broke up years\nago. Mother married again. That was fifteen years ago. I was ten, and\nKen was thirteen. We took our stepfather's name, but Ken and he never\ngot along very well. Ken ran away to Venus when he was seventeen.\nMother died a year ago. I--I wanted to find Ken and help him. My\nstepfather had him traced for me and we found out he was in trouble\nwith the police. I thought if I could talk to him, maybe he'd give\nhimself up, take his just punishment, and we could start over again\ntogether. Ken's all I have left. He's not bad. A little wild, but not\nbad.\"\n\nCoran stood up and stared into the black gulf of space through the\nvisiplate. He felt a sudden bleak distaste for his profession.\n\n\"I'm afraid it's a little late for that,\" he said gently. \"He's wanted\nfor barratry, murder, and perhaps treason. The penalty for any one of\nthem is death. I'm sorry.\"\n\nGerda sat silently, brooding over the information. \"You think I'm going\nto cry, don't you? And you hate emotional women. You can relax. I think\nI've known all along that it was hopeless. It does hurt, but I'm beyond\ncrying any more.\"\n\n\n\nFar out in the void a clustered blur of faint, needle-sharp lights\netched itself against the star-patterned darkness. Space-ships, coming\nup fast under rocket power. Coran glanced quickly at the wall-chron. It\nwas too soon for the space patrol. Even under full acceleration, they\ncould not make it in less than three hours.\n\n\"I'll have to trust you,\" he said grimly, \"Brace yourself--company's\ncoming.\"\n\nGerda snapped out of her black reverie.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"We'd better work out a plan of action.\" Working like mad, Coran dumped\nthe contents of the metal toolbox onto the floor. With a wrench, he\nsmashed the hand-operated controls which worked the airlock from the\ninterior of the ship into a tangle of twisted machinery. Then he\nscooped up the rest of the tools and threw them down a waste disposal\nchute.\n\n\"Get inside the toolbox,\" he ordered. \"Try it once to make sure you\ncan raise the lid from inside. Then keep out of sight. When they get\nhere, I'll try to draw them away into the after part of the ship. If\nI succeed in drawing them off, you slip out and get into the airlock.\nClose the door and lock it from inside. If I manage to circle around\nand get back here, I'll signal you with three soft taps on the door,\nfollowed by three hard ones. Don't open for anyone else. It'll take\nthem over an hour to cut through that door from in here. You'll have a\ngambler's chance.\"\n\n\"Good luck,\" said Gerda softly. She climbed into the toolbox while\nCoran recharged the blaster-gun and stuffed his pockets with extra\nammunition.\n\nGerda raised the box lid slightly. \"It works, Steve,\" she said. \"Take\ncare of yourself.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"One thing more. When you're into the airlock, get into a\nspace-suit and get one ready for me. They're on racks at the left side,\ninside a locker.\"\n\nShe nodded. The lid slammed down.\n\nCoran re-arranged the stowage of boxes in the next compartment into a\nseries of defensive barricades, then crouched beside the half-opened\ndoor of the sally-port. He had not long to wait.\n\nThe airlock door swung open and three rough-looking men in space suits\ncame cautiously through. They were followed by a dozen others not\nwearing the heavily-insulated space armor. The pirates must have run a\ngangway tube between the ships and fastened it with magnetic grapnels.\nThe outer doors of the airlock would open automatically as the pressure\nequalized. He wondered if Gerda would have sense enough to close and\nbolt the outer as well as the inward doors. It was too late to worry\nabout that now.\n\nCoran took careful aim and fired his blaster beam into the crowd of\nmen. Four were killed by the first discharge. The others broke for\ncover. Blaster beams interlaced, and the room jarred with repeated\nconcussion. Men poured through the opened airlock door. The temperature\nrose sharply with the release of energy. The pirates rushed the door\nand Coran was forced to fall back to his line of barricades.\n\nHe retreated cautiously, firing as he went. From behind the last of his\nbarricades, he burned down three of his foes, then broke and ran for\nthe engine-room shaft, leaping across it to the spiralled stair. Just\nas he reached the upper loft of engines a beam cut down the shaft. He\ndodged behind a massive generator, but three blaster beams concentrated\non it. The force of their tripled discharge tore it from its moorings.\nArtificial gravity combined with its mass to send it crashing into a\ntangle of the intricate machinery below.\n\nTo avoid being crushed, Coran was forced to plunge down the second\nshaft. He lost himself in the spiderweb of inner support beams. The\npirates scattered and climbed into the maze of beams, probing with\ntheir blaster rays as shadows moved uneasily in the eerie darkness. The\nlumibulbs waxed and waned as the unsteady current fluctuated.\n\n\n\nFurther and further Coran led them, always away from the sally-port and\nthe airlock, darting chance beams at his pursuers whenever opportunity\npresented. He had the advantage of knowing that they were all enemies.\nTheir forces were divided and confused. In the weird and uncomfortable\nlofts of the engine-room, clear targets were impossible.\n\nA wild half-plan occurred to Coran. He headed in the direction of the\nmain engine-room switch box and with his beam burned out all the fuses.\n\nPit-like darkness enveloped the lofts as the lumibulbs went out. It\nwas touch and go sliding down the long beams in the pall of utter\nblackness. He reached a catwalk, and cautiously made his way toward the\nelevators. Once he collided with a heavy body and a man swore savagely.\n\nHe missed the elevators, but by some miracle found a hatchway leading\nto the cargo holds. Sliding through, he cut down the intensity of his\nblaster beam and melted the plastic and metal hatchcover into a fused\nmass. That should delay them a few minutes. He scuttled down a deserted\npassageway and began climbing flights of stairs. If he could only find\nhis way back to the sally-port from this other direction. He came\nsuddenly into the room of his hasty barricades next to the sally-port.\nIt was occupied.\n\nTwo men had been left behind as guards. He caught them unawares, and\nburned both down with one sweep of his beam.\n\nThe sally-port was empty. The box lid lay on the floor and the airlock\ndoor was closed tight.\n\nWith the butt of his blaster, he tapped out the signal on the airlock\ndoor.\n\nThere was a smooth hiss of releasing metal parts and the airlock door\ncame open. He slipped through and slammed the door, spinning the\nlockbolts tight.\n\n\"Thank heavens, you made it,\" Gerda said. Pale and shaken, she handed\nhim the heavy space-armor. \"I was afraid you'd run into those others in\nthe next room. They almost caught me. I had the lid half-raised when\nthey came into the sally-port to check.\"\n\n\"Put on your helmet,\" he ordered roughly, as she handed him the\nfishbowl-like contrivance.\n\nShe laughed. \"The air's bad in here. I could hardly breathe, and I\ndidn't know how to work the valves in the helmet.\"\n\nCoran swore briefly, then adjusted her helmet and put on his own. He\nset the microphones and the space communicators.\n\n\"I shut the outside door,\" she complained. \"I even bolted it, but it\nwon't stay locked.\"\n\n\"It's automatic,\" he told her. \"When the air pressure's equal on both\nsides, it opens. I'll show you.\"\n\nJust as he reached for the controls, the door came open with a violent\ncrash. Hamlin stood framed in the doorway, blaster gun in hand.\n\n\"I hadn't counted on you, Coran,\" he said. The gun did not waver.\n\"Don't reach for that gun.\"\n\n\n\nCoran relaxed and stared at his opponent. \"You look quite different\nwithout the plastic mask,\" he observed. Hamlin was older than he had\nlooked in the photographs, but noticeably the same man, despite lines\nof strain which did not show in either picture.\n\nHamlin smiled wolfishly. \"My pictures don't flatter me, do they? The\nproblem is what you've done with my men. You are becoming a nuisance,\nCoran. I'll have to kill you, of course, but I'd like to know how you\nmanaged this switch.\"\n\nCoran was playing for time. \"I'll make a deal with you,\" he said. \"I'm\ncurious to know why you pulled that Martian plague stunt with Gerda.\"\n\nHamlin laughed. \"I recognized her at once, even though she had changed\nsince I last saw her. Ten years is a long time when you're kids, but\nI'd seen a picture of her since then. When I saw you with her, I knew\nyou were up to something. I wanted to keep you away from her till\nI could deal with you. The rest was easy, just a little grease and\naluminum powder. The doctor was scared to death....\"\n\nGerda was staring at her brother through the space helmet. \"You did\nknow me, Ken?\"\n\nHamlin shot her a contemptuous glance. \"You little fool,\" he snapped.\n\"You should never have come here. I don't know what I'm going to do\nwith you.\"\n\nGerda cringed as if he had struck her. \"We'll have plenty of time for\nold home week later,\" Hamlin went on. \"Now tell me what's happened to\nmy men, Coran. I haven't much time to waste on you.\"\n\nCoran bit his lip. \"I just lured them into the engine-room and tangled\nthem up in the lofts, then blew out the lights. It was a good trick\nwhile it worked. Some of them got weeded out on the way.\"\n\n\"Now it's your turn, Coran,\" Hamlin said brutally. His finger tightened\non the trigger. Gerda stood looking from one to the other with a look\nof anguish on her face. \"Don't do it, Ken,\" she said, moving in front\nof Coran.\n\n\"Stay out of this, Gerda,\" Coran warned.\n\n\"I'm not kidding,\" Hamlin said, \"if you get in my way, I'll kill both\nof you.\"\n\nCoran struck her helmet so heavily she fell against the wall. In the\nsame movement, he lunged at Hamlin. The blaster beam raked the ceiling,\nand in that confined space concussion was unbearable, even inside the\nspace suits. Coran's blow knocked Hamlin through the doorway into the\nconnecting tube. Coran swung about and caught up his gun.\n\n\"Don't shoot, Steve,\" Gerda wailed.\n\nThe shock of the first blaster discharge had loosened the magnetic\ngrapnels which held the ships together. The pirate's craft began to\ndrift away, tearing loose the end of the tube.\n\nHamlin was on his feet, trying to fire his blaster, but the charge was\nburned out. It only flickered feebly. He leaped the widening distance\nbetween the ships and went up the side like a spider, gripping the\nshell of the _Erania_ with the magnetic soles of his space-boots. Coran\nclimbed round the doorway and went up after him, gun in hand.\n\nHamlin had disappeared round the curve of the hull. It was rough,\ndangerous work climbing round the outer shell of a space-ship. One slip\nmeant a plunge into the awesome emptiness of the void. Gravity was\npractically non-existent, but the grip of the soles was slight, and\nonly one foot could be moved at a time.\n\nFrom the vantage point of his cover behind a dead rocket tube, Hamlin\nwaited. He knew that his time was short. Off across the black gulf of\nspace three flakes of gleaming light resolved themselves into fast\npatrol cruisers, racing toward the derelict _Erania_. Coran had not\nseen them, but came on steadily, determined to see his assignment\nthrough. Hamlin waited, gun resting on the rocket tube, hoping for a\nclear shot. Mad with hatred, he blamed Coran for the failure of his\nwhole life, and was viciously resolved to take his enemy with him.\n\nThe patrol ships moved in close and warped alongside the _Aphrodite_.\nMen in space suits poured out of the access hatch and guns were trained\non the rocket tube behind which Hamlin held out.\n\nSick fury possessed Hamlin. With the gesture of a trapped rat, he\nrammed his blaster-gun up the vents of the rocket tube. If he could\nignite the remaining fuel, they would all blow to Kingdom Come in a\nroaring atomic holocaust.\n\nCoran saw his intent and stood up to fire. His beam went wildly into\nthe darkness as he lost his balance and toppled into space. Another\nbeam whipped out from the patrol cruiser and caught Hamlin full force\nas he stood up to fire into the tube.\n\nHe vanished in a glittering cloud of particles, dispersed instantly by\ntheir own radiation.\n\nLines with magnetic grapnels looped out and snatched Coran reeling him\nback to the patrol ship like a grotesque fish. For three days, he lay\nunconscious from space-shock....\n\n\n\nBack on the Moon, at Luna Station, three people were waiting for the\nMartian Express to take-off.\n\n\"You see, Steve, Gerda's really my daughter,\" Paul Jomian explained.\n\"Her mother divorced me fifteen years ago, and a year later married\nGartan Mors. She took the children, of course, and Mors raised them as\nhis own. Gerda was young enough to conform but Ken was always wild. He\ntook it for three or four years, then ran away to Venus. Gerda always\nidolized him, but really she scarcely knew him. If anyone's at fault in\nall this, I am the one to blame. I was a stubborn fool, and Nell could\nnever stand my job.\"\n\nGerda offered her hand to Coran. \"I hate long goodbyes,\" she said. \"I'm\nsorry about everything. I--I don't really blame you for Ken's death.\nGoodbye, and good luck.\"\n\nSteve decided it was safe to play out a fond and corny farewell. He\ntook her hand lingeringly. \"Don't worry about things, Gerda. I know\nhow you feel. It wouldn't have worked out anyhow. Just let me know\nwhen you get the divorce. Let's break this up. I thought that I hated\nMars-station, but now that I'm through with the Space Patrol, I can't\nwait to get back.\"\n\nPaul Jomian put his arm around his daughter as they watched Coran turn\nand wave before climbing aboard the express cruiser. On Coran's face\nwas the smug complacency of a man who has neatly avoided being stuck\nwith a dame. He grinned and vanished up the gangplank. Jomian muttered\nsomething inaudibly.\n\n\"You're a sucker to let a man like Steve get away ... for any reason,\"\nhe told her. \"Such men are hard to find, and still harder to hook once\nyou've found them.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" she said firmly, though tears brimmed in her eyes. \"But I\njust couldn't love the man who'd killed my brother. I couldn't.\"\n\n\"That's the biggest mistake you ever made. Steve didn't want me to\ntell you, but he didn't shoot Ken. His beam went wild.\" Jomian nerved\nhimself for an ordeal. \"I killed him.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me--_why_?\" she wailed.\n\n\"I should have told you before, but I couldn't. I didn't want you to\nhate me, now that I'd just found you.\"\n\nGerda clung to her father fiercely. \"I couldn't hate you, dad. But we\nmustn't let him go. I might have a chance to win him, but how can I if\nhe's on Mars and I'm here?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that's out of our hands. Steve doesn't know it, but he's\nnot through with the space patrol. They refused his resignation. He's\njust been appointed commander of the Mars-Jupiter sector. Do you think\nyou have the guts to be a spaceman's wife?\"\n\n\"I _know_ I have. But how'll I ever convince Steve? You heard him. He\nsaid it wouldn't ever work out.\"\n\n\"That's your problem. He's a stubborn man.\"\n\nSudden determination shone in her face. \"And I'm a stubborn woman,\" she\ncalled back, blowing her father a kiss. She reached the gangplank just\nin time to grab it and be dragged up with it.\n\nJomian grinned. \"She's my kid. I'll bet she trims his wings, the rat.\"\n",
