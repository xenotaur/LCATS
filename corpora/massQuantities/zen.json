    "body": "It's difficult, when you're on one of the asteroids, to keep from\ntripping, because it's almost impossible to keep your eyes on the\nground. They never got around to putting portholes in spaceships, you\nknow--unnecessary when you're flying by GB, and psychologically\ninadvisable, besides--so an asteroid is about the only place, apart from\nLuna, where you can really see the stars.\n\nThere are so many stars in an asteroid sky that they look like clouds;\nlike massive, heaped-up silver clouds floating slowly around the inner\nsurface of the vast ebony sphere that surrounds you and your tiny\nfoothold. They are near enough to touch, and you want to touch them, but\nthey are so frighteningly far away ... and so beautiful: there's nothing\nin creation half so beautiful as an asteroid sky.\n\nYou don't want to look down, naturally.\n\n\n\nI had left the _Lucky Pierre_ to search for fossils (I'm David Koontz,\nthe _Lucky Pierre_'s paleontologist). Somewhere off in the darkness on\neither side of me were Joe Hargraves, gadgeting for mineral deposits,\nand Ed Reiss, hopefully on the lookout for anything alive. The _Lucky\nPierre_ was back of us, her body out of sight behind a low black ridge,\nonly her gleaming nose poking above like a porpoise coming up for air.\nWhen I looked back, I could see, along the jagged rim of the ridge, the\nbusy reflected flickerings of the bubble-camp the techs were throwing\ntogether. Otherwise all was black, except for our blue-white torch beams\nthat darted here and there over the gritty, rocky surface.\n\nThe twenty-nine of us were E.T.I. Team 17, whose assignment was the\nasteroids. We were four years and three months out of Terra, and we'd\nreached Vesta right on schedule. Ten minutes after landing, we had known\nthat the clod was part of the crust of Planet X--or Sorn, to give it its\nright name--one of the few such parts that hadn't been blown clean out\nof the Solar System.\n\nThat made Vesta extra-special. It meant settling down for a while. It\nmeant a careful, months-long scrutiny of Vesta's every square inch and a\nlot of her cubic ones, especially by the life-scientists. Fossils,\nartifacts, animate life ... a surface chunk of Sorn might harbor any of\nthese, or all. Some we'd tackled already had a few.\n\nIn a day or so, of course, we'd have the one-man beetles and crewboats\nout, and the floodlights orbiting overhead, and Vesta would be as\nexposed to us as a molecule on a microscreen. Then work would start in\nearnest. But in the meantime--and as usual--Hargraves, Reiss and I were\nout prowling, our weighted boots clomping along in darkness. Captain\nFeldman had long ago given up trying to keep his science-minded charges\nfrom galloping off alone like this. In spite of being a military man,\nFeld's a nice guy; he just shrugs and says, \"Scientists!\" when we appear\nbrightly at the airlock, waiting to be let out.\n\n\n\nSo the three of us went our separate ways, and soon were out of sight of\none another. Ed Reiss, the biologist, was looking hardest for animate\nlife, naturally.\n\nBut I found it.\n\n\n\nI had crossed a long, rounded expanse of rock--lava, wonderfully\ncolored--and was descending into a boulder-cluttered pocket. I was\nnearing the \"bottom\" of the chunk, the part that had been the deepest\nbeneath Sorn's surface before the blow-up. It was the likeliest place to\nlook for fossils.\n\nBut instead of looking for fossils, my eyes kept rising to those\nincredible stars. You get that way particularly after several weeks of\nliving in steel; and it was lucky that I got that way this time, or I\nmight have missed the Zen.\n\nMy feet tangled with a rock. I started a slow, light-gravity fall, and\nlooked down to catch my balance. My torch beam flickered across a small,\nred-furred teddy-bear shape. The light passed on. I brought it sharply\nback to target.\n\nMy hair did _not_ stand on end, regardless of what you've heard me\nquoted as saying. Why should it have, when I already knew Yurt so\nwell--considered him, in fact, one of my closest friends?\n\nThe Zen was standing by a rock, one paw resting on it, ears cocked\nforward, its stubby hind legs braced ready to launch it into flight. Big\nyellow eyes blinked unemotionally at the glare of the torch, and I cut\ndown its brilliance with a twist of the polarizer lens.\n\nThe creature stared at me, looking ready to jump halfway to Mars or\nstraight at me if I made a wrong move.\n\nI addressed it in its own language, clucking my tongue and whistling\nthrough my teeth: \"Suh, Zen--\"\n\nIn the blue-white light of the torch, the Zen shivered. It didn't say\nanything. I thought I knew why. Three thousand years of darkness and\nsilence ...\n\nI said, \"I won't hurt you,\" again speaking in its own language.\n\nThe Zen moved away from the rock, but not away from me. It came a little\ncloser, actually, and peered up at my helmeted, mirror-glassed\nhead--unmistakably the seat of intelligence, it appears, of any race\nanywhere. Its mouth, almost human-shaped, worked; finally words came. It\nhadn't spoken, except to itself, for three thousand years.\n\n\"You ... are not Zen,\" it said. \"Why--how do you speak Zennacai?\"\n\nIt took me a couple of seconds to untangle the squeaking syllables and\nget any sense out of them. What I had already said to it were stock\nphrases that Yurt had taught me; I knew still more, but I couldn't\nspeak Zennacai fluently by any means. Keep this in mind, by the way: I\nbarely knew the language, and the Zen could barely remember it. To save\nspace, the following dialogue is reproduced without bumblings, blank\nstares and _What-did-you-says_? In reality, our talk lasted over an\nhour.\n\n\"I am an Earthman,\" I said. Through my earphones, when I spoke, I could\nfaintly hear my own voice as the Zen must have heard it in Vesta's all\nbut nonexistent atmosphere: tiny, metallic, cricket-like.\n\n\"Eert ... mn?\"\n\nI pointed at the sky, the incredible sky. \"From out there. From another\nworld.\"\n\nIt thought about that for a while. I waited. We already knew that the\nZens had been better astronomers at their peak than we were right now,\neven though they'd never mastered space travel; so I didn't expect this\none to boggle at the notion of creatures from another world. It didn't.\nFinally it nodded, and I thought, as I had often before, how curious it\nwas that this gesture should be common to Earthmen and Zen.\n\n\"So. Eert-mn,\" it said. \"And you know what I am?\"\n\nWhen I understood, I nodded, too. Then I said, \"Yes,\" realizing that the\nnod wasn't visible through the one-way glass of my helmet.\n\n\"I am--last of Zen,\" it said.\n\nI said nothing. I was studying it closely, looking for the features\nwhich Yurt had described to us: the lighter red fur of arms and neck,\nthe peculiar formation of flesh and horn on the lower abdomen. They were\nthere. From the coloring, I knew this Zen was a female.\n\nThe mouth worked again--not with emotion, I knew, but with the\nunfamiliar act of speaking. \"I have been here for--for--\" she\nhesitated--\"I don't know. For five hundred of my years.\"\n\n\"For about three thousand of mine,\" I told her.\n\n\n\nAnd then blank astonishment sank home in me--astonishment at the last\ntwo words of her remark. I was already familiar with the Zens' enormous\nintelligence, knowing Yurt as I did ... but imagine thinking to qualify\n_years_ with _my_ when just out of nowhere a visitor from another\nplanetary orbit pops up! And there had been no special stress given the\ndistinction, just clear, precise thinking, like Yurt's.\n\nI added, still a little awed: \"We know how long ago your world died.\"\n\n\"I was child then,\" she said, \"I don't know--what happened. I have\nwondered.\" She looked up at my steel-and-glass face; I must have seemed\nlike a giant. Well, I suppose I was. \"This--what we are on--was part of\nSorn, I know. Was it--\" She fumbled for a word--\"was it atom explosion?\"\n\nI told her how Sorn had gotten careless with its hydrogen atoms and had\nblown itself over half of creation. (This the E.T.I. Teams had surmised\nfrom scientific records found on Eros, as well as from geophysical\nevidence scattered throughout the other bodies.)\n\n\"I was child,\" she said again after a moment. \"But I remember--I\nremember things _different_ from this. Air ... heat ... light ... how do\nI live here?\"\n\nAgain I felt amazement at its intelligence; (and it suddenly occurred to\nme that astronomy and nuclear physics must have been taught in Sorn's\n\"elementary schools\"--else that _my years_ and _atom explosion_ would\nhave been all but impossible). And now this old, old creature,\nremembering back three thousand years to childhood--probably to those\n\"elementary schools\"--remembering, and defining the differences in\nenvironment between _then_ and _now_; and more, wondering at its\nexistence in the different _now_--\n\nAnd then I got my own thinking straightened out. I recalled some of the\nthings we had learned about the Zen.\n\nTheir average lifespan had been 12,000 years or a little over. So the\nZen before me was, by our standards, about twenty-five years old.\nNothing at all strange about remembering, when you are twenty-five, the\nthings that happened to you when you were seven ...\n\nBut the Zen's question, even my rationalization of my reaction to it,\nhad given me a chill. Here was no cuddly teddy bear.\n\nThis creature had been born before Christ!\n\nShe had been alone for three thousand years, on a chip of bone from her\ndead world beneath a sepulchre of stars. The last and greatest Martian\ncivilization, the _L'hrai_, had risen and fallen in her lifetime. And\nshe was twenty-five years old.\n\n\"How do I live here?\" she asked again.\n\nI got back into my own framework of temporal reference, so to speak, and\nbegan explaining to a Zen what a Zen was. (I found out later from Yurt\nthat biology, for the reasons which follow, was one of the most\ndifficult studies; so difficult that nuclear physics actually _preceded_\nit!) I told her that the Zen had been, all evidence indicated, the\ntoughest, hardest, longest-lived creatures God had ever cooked up:\npractically independent of their environment, no special ecological\nniche; just raw, stubborn, tenacious life, developed to a fantastic\nextreme--a greater force of life than any other known, one that could\nexist almost anywhere under practically any conditions--even floating in\nmidspace, which, asteroid or no, this Zen was doing right now.\n\nThe Zens breathed, all right, but it was nothing they'd had to do in\norder to live. It gave them nothing their incredible metabolism couldn't\nscrounge up out of rock or cosmic rays or interstellar gas or simply do\nwithout for a few thousand years. If the human body is a furnace, then\nthe Zen body is a feeder pile. Maybe that, I thought, was what evolution\nalways worked toward.\n\n\"Please, will you kill me?\" the Zen said.\n\n\n\nI'd been expecting that. Two years ago, on the bleak surface of Eros,\nYurt had asked Engstrom to do the same thing. But I asked, \"Why?\"\nalthough I knew what the answer would be, too.\n\nThe Zen looked up at me. She was exhibiting every ounce of emotion a Zen\nis capable of, which is a lot; and I could recognize it, but not in any\nfamiliar terms. A tiny motion here, a quiver there, but very quiet and\nstill for the most part. And _that_ was the violent expression:\nrestraint. Yurt, after two years of living with us, still couldn't\nunderstand why we found this confusing.\n\nDifficult, aliens--or being alien.\n\n\"I've tried so often to do it myself,\" the Zen said softly. \"But I\ncan't. I can't even hurt myself. Why do I want you to kill me?\" She was\neven quieter. Maybe she was crying. \"I'm alone. Five hundred years,\nEert-mn--not too long. I'm still young. But what good is it--life--when\nthere are no other Zen?\"\n\n\"How do you know there are no other Zen?\"\n\n\"There are no others,\" she said almost inaudibly. I suppose a human girl\nmight have shrieked it.\n\n_A child_, I thought, _when your world blew up. And you survived. Now\nyou're a young three-thousand-year-old woman ... uneducated, afraid,\nprobably crawling with neuroses. Even so, in your thousand-year terms,\nyoung lady, you're not too old to change._\n\n\"Will you kill me?\" she asked again.\n\nAnd suddenly I was having one of those eye-popping third-row-center\nviews of the whole scene: the enormous, beautiful sky; the dead clod,\nVesta; the little creature who stood there staring at me--the\nbrilliant-ignorant, humanlike-alien, old-young creature who was asking\nme to kill her.\n\nFor a moment the human quality of her thinking terrified me ... the\nfeeling you might have waking up some night and finding your pet puppy\nsitting on your chest, looking at you with wise eyes and white fangs\ngleaming ...\n\nThen I thought of Yurt--smart, friendly Yurt, who had learned to laugh\nand wisecrack--and I came out of the jeebies. I realized that here was\nonly a sick girl, no tiny monster. And if she were as resilient as Yurt\n... well, it was his problem. He'd probably pull her through.\n\nBut I didn't pick her up. I made no attempt to take her back to the\nship. Her tiny white teeth and tiny yellow claws were harder than steel;\nand she was, I knew, unbelievably strong for her size. If she got\nsuspicious or decided to throw a phobic tizzy, she could scatter shreds\nof me over a square acre of Vesta in less time than it would take me to\nyelp.\n\n\"Will you--\" she began again.\n\nI tried shakily, \"Hell, no. Wait here.\" Then I had to translate it.\n\n\n\nI went back to the _Lucky Pierre_ and got Yurt. We could do without him,\neven though he had been a big help. We'd taught him a lot--he'd been a\nchild at the blow-up, too--and he'd taught us a lot. But this was more\nimportant, of course.\n\nWhen I told him what had happened, he was very quiet; crying, perhaps,\njust like a human being, with happiness.\n\nCap Feldman asked me what was up, and I told him, and he said, \"Well,\nI'll be blessed!\"\n\nI said, \"Yurt, are you sure you want us to keep hands off ... just go\noff and leave you?\"\n\n\"Yes, please.\"\n\nFeldman said, \"Well, I'll be blessed.\"\n\nYurt, who spoke excellent English, said, \"Bless you all.\"\n\nI took him back to where the female waited. From the ridge, I knew, the\nentire crew was watching through binocs. I set him down, and he fell to\nstudying her intently.\n\n\"I am not a Zen,\" I told her, giving my torch full brilliance for the\ncrew's sake, \"but Yurt here is. Do you see ... I mean, do you know what\nyou look like?\"\n\nShe said, \"I can see enough of my own body to--and--yes ...\"\n\n\"Yurt,\" I said, \"here's the female we thought we might find. Take over.\"\n\nYurt's eyes were fastened on the girl.\n\n\"What--do I do now?\" she whispered worriedly.\n\n\"I'm afraid that's something only a Zen would know,\" I told her,\nsmiling inside my helmet. \"I'm not a Zen. Yurt is.\"\n\nShe turned to him. \"You will tell me?\"\n\n\"If it becomes necessary.\" He moved closer to her, not even looking back\nto talk to me. \"Give us some time to get acquainted, will you, Dave? And\nyou might leave some supplies and a bubble at the camp when you move on,\njust to make things pleasanter.\"\n\nBy this time he had reached the female. They were as still as space, not\na sound, not a motion. I wanted to hang around, but I knew how I'd feel\nif a Zen, say, wouldn't go away if I were the last man alive and had\njust met the last woman.\n\nI moved my torch off them and headed back for the _Lucky Pierre_. We all\nhad a drink to the saving of a great race that might have become\nextinct. Ed Reiss, though, had to do some worrying before he could down\nhis drink.\n\n\"What if they don't like each other?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"They don't have much choice,\" Captain Feldman said, always the realist.\n\"Why do homely women fight for jobs on the most isolated space\noutposts?\"\n\nReiss grinned. \"That's right. They look awful good after a year or two\nin space.\"\n\n\"Make that twenty-five by Zen standards or three thousand by ours,\" said\nJoe Hargraves, \"and I'll bet they look beautiful to each other.\"\n\nWe decided to drop our investigation of Vesta for the time being, and\ncome back to it after the honeymoon.\n\nSix months later, when we returned, there were twelve hundred Zen on\nVesta!\n\nCaptain Feldman was a realist but he was also a deeply moral man. He\nwent to Yurt and said, \"It's indecent! Couldn't the two of you control\nyourselves at least a little? _Twelve hundred kids!_\"\n\n\"We were rather surprised ourselves,\" Yurt said complacently. \"But this\nseems to be how Zen reproduce. Can you have only half a child?\"\n\nNaturally, Feld got the authorities to quarantine Vesta. Good God, the\nZen could push us clear out of the Solar System in a couple of\ngenerations!\n\nI don't think they would, but you can't take such chances, can you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
