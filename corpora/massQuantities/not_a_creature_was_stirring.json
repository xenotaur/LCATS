    "body": "He was a tall, hard man with skin the color of very old iodine. When he\nclimbed up out of the vertical shaft of his small gold mine, _The Lousy\nDisappointment_, he could have been taken for an Indian, he was that\ndark. Except, of course, that Indians didn't exist any more in 1982.\nHis name was Tom Gannett and he was about forty years old and he didn't\nrealize his own uniqueness.\n\nWhen he made it to his feet, the first thing he did was to squint up\nat the sun. The second was to sneeze, and the third to blow his nose.\n\n\"Hey, you old sun!\" he growled. \"You old crummy sun, you look sicker'n\na dog.\"\n\nWhich was literally true, for the sun seemed to be pretty queer. The\nwhole sky seemed to be pretty queer, for that matter. Skies should\nbe blue and the sun should be a bloated golden bauble drifting\nserenely across them. But the skies were not blue; they were a dirty\npurplish-gray. And the sun wasn't a bloated golden bauble; somebody\nhad it by the scruff of the neck and was dragging it.\n\nGannett planted his big feet wide apart and frowned sourly around and\nsniffed the air like a dog at a gopher hole. \"The damn world smells\nsick,\" he grunted.\n\nWhich was also true. The world did smell sick. The world smelled\nsomething like that peculiar odor that comes from an old graveyard\ncarefully tended by an old man with dank moss sticking to the soles of\nhis old shoes. That kind of smell.\n\nGannett didn't know why the sun looked sick, and he didn't know why the\nworld smelled sick. Indeed, there were many things Gannett didn't know,\namong which would be these in particular:\n\n    (a) He did not know (since, for the last six months, he had been\n    living and working all alone at his little mine, which was in the\n    remotest of the most remote desert regions of Nevada) that a little\n    less than three weeks earlier, mankind had finally achieved the\n    inevitable: man's own annihilation.\n\n    (b) He did not know that he was going to be the loneliest man on\n    Earth--he who was used to, and perfectly content with, the\n    hermitlike existence of a desert rat.\n\n    (c) He furthermore did not know that there were four of the Ten\n    Commandments which he wasn't going to be able to break any\n    more--not even if he stayed up nights trying and lived for\n    centuries.\n\n\n\nGannett snorted the smell from his nostrils and shrugged. Hell with it.\nHe thought about Reno and how he hadn't been there for nearly a year.\nHe thought of the dimly lighted, soft-carpeted cocktail lounges in Reno\nwhere drinks come in long stemmed glasses and blondes in long-stemmed\nlegs. Reno at Christmastime, he thought. There was a town, Reno!\n\nHe grinned, showing big gold teeth that blazed out of his mouth like\nthe glittering grille on a Buick. He dug his feet into the hard ground\nand walked the hundred feet or so to his cabin where he sometimes\nslept when he didn't happen to sleep in the mine. He stripped off his\ngrime-sodden clothes. He stepped out of them, in fact, and stretched\nluxuriously as though he hadn't felt the good joy of being unclothed\nfor a long time.\n\nHe got up and went to a corner of the cabin, rummaged out a pair of\ndusty clogs and pushed his feet into them. Then--and they don't come\nany nakeder than he was--he went outside and around the shack to the\nrear where he kept his jeep and where the shower was.\n\nHe stepped into it, for it was nothing more ornate than a large oil\ndrum suspended on long four by sixes. He yanked on a rope that hung\ndown from the drum. The result of doing that made him leap out again\ndripping wet and colder than a buried mother-in-law.\n\nHe shivered, eyes blinking fast. He took a deep breath. His gold\nteeth went together tightly and the big muscles in his neck corded\ndefensively. He deliberately went under the shower again. Pawing a\nsliver of laundry soap from a ledge on one of the four by sixes, he\nwent to work with it, and when he finally tripped the hanging rope once\nmore, he was a clean man.\n\nHe went into the cabin. It wasn't any warmer than the great outdoors,\nbut that was where his clothes were. He shaved from an old granite\nbasin full of cold water. After that he went to a hook on the wall and\ngot down a suit of clothes which looked as though it had shriveled up\nwaiting for somebody to wear it. The last thing he did before leaving\nwas to pry up one of the boards behind the door and lift out of this\nhiding place a small leather bag.\n\nThe bag was filled with gold.\n\n\n\nThe sun was gone now. Leg-like rays of light still sprawled,\ndirty-looking, in the sky over toward the California line, but aside\nfrom these extremities, most of it was somewhere out in the Pacific.\nThe purplish sky was darker now. Drab. Dead, somehow.\n\nThe old jeep started nicely. It always started nicely; that was one\nof the good things about a jeep. The only funny thing was that out of\nits exhaust pipe in the rear came angry purplish flames. Queer flames.\nGannett stared at them, surprised.\n\n\"Even the damn jeep is sick,\" he muttered. He was wrong, of course, but\nhe had no way of knowing that. He backed around, finally, and went down\nwhat he called his driveway, which was little more than rock-strewn\nground, until he came to a small dirt road. This led him to another,\nlarger dirt road, which in turn led him to route #395, which was a U.S.\nHighway.\n\nA hundred miles farther on, he came to the outskirts of Carson City. It\nwasn't until he pulled into a gas station that he realized something\nwas wrong. Nobody jumped out to wipe his windshield. The attendant who\nstill leaned in the doorway of the station had a rag in his hand, but\nhe didn't budge. He couldn't. His face looked like weathered leather\nand he was dead.\n\n\"Holy...!\" whispered Gannett incredulously. He forgot about needing\ngas. He jumped in the jeep and drove down the main stem and found\nPolice Headquarters in an old gray stone building. He knew it was\nPolice Headquarters for the green neon over the revolving door had\n_CPD_ on it and it was still burning.\n\nHe went up the steps two at a time, banged through the swinging doors\nand stamped straight to where the Sergeant sat at a desk over in the\ncorner by the switchboard.\n\n\"Hey, by God!\" yelled Gannett to the Desk Sergeant. \"There's a guy down\nthe street in a gas station and he's standing up in the doorway and\nhe's dead as a mackerel!\"\n\nDramatic words. But the Desk Sergeant was no longer among the living\nand didn't appreciate them. It took Gannett a long while to get over\nthat. He slowly backed away. He made the big oak doors, still backing.\nHe went down the stairs on legs as stiff as icicles.\n\nHe got back in his jeep and started up again. He knew there was\nsomething terribly wrong, but before he thought about it, he knew he\nhad to have a drink. He pulled up in front of a saloon that had nice,\ncheery, glowing lights showing through the big front window. He got out\nof the jeep. He went through the swinging glass doors and straight to\nthe bar.\n\n\"Scotch!\"\n\nNobody answered. The barman behind the mahogany, facing him, didn't\nmake a move. The barman had a dead cigarette between his cold colorless\nlips. The cigarette had a half inch of ash on it. The ash looked as\nthough it was sculptured out of purple marble.\n\nGannett put both hands flat on the bar and swallowed hard. He\ntwisted his head and looked over the shoulder of a customer on his\nleft, who was leaning negligently on the bar with one elbow. There\nwas a half-full bottle in front of the leaning man and it had an\nalert-looking horse's head stuck in the neck of it for a pouring spout.\n\n\"Excuse me, Mac,\" Gannett whispered.\n\nThe leaning man didn't twitch a muscle.\n\nGannett sucked in a deep breath. He reached. He got the bottle. He\nblinked stupidly at the bottle and then he put it down very carefully\nand took another breath and looked at a highball glass in front of the\nleaning man. The highball glass was empty and clean, but the leaning\nman's fingers were curled lightly and gracefully around it. They were\nnice fingers. White fingers. Fingers that looked as if they hadn't had\nto do any hard work lately. Slender, tapering, carefully manicured\nfingers.\n\nGannett swore softly. He yanked the horse's head out and then poked\nthe bottle into his mouth and tilted it up. He held it until there\nwasn't anything left but the very glass it was made of plus the bright\nlittle paper label. His throat burned. He coughed. He banged the empty\nbottle down on the bartop and coughed again--hard.\n\nThe leaning man stirred, seemed to turn slowly, stiffly, in a half arc\nthat put him face to face with Gannett. Then he went down backward and\nall in one piece, like a tall tree on top of a hill on a very still\nnight.\n\nHe went down with the glass in his hand and, when he hit, swirls of\nthick dust rose lazily from the floor and then settled back over his\nrigid form like freshly falling snow blanketing something left out on\nthe front lawn.\n\n\n\nThe night was black. There wasn't a star and there wasn't a sound\nexcept for Earth sounds, which are never very loud. Gannett sat in his\njeep with the motor running and the purple flames coming out of the\ntailpipe. His hands were tight around the wheel, but the Jeep wasn't\nmoving. Gannett was staring off into space and his eyes looked as\nthough somebody had peeled them back.\n\nHe said it to himself mentally, for the first few times. Then, as if\nhe couldn't contain them any longer, the words tumbled out of his mouth\ninto the night air:\n\n\"Everybody's dead, by God!\"\n\nHe drove through deserted streets until he found an all-night\ndrugstore. It didn't seem funny to him just yet that the streets were\ndeserted; that was something he would think of later. He walked into\nthe drugstore and went to the newsstand and picked up a copy of the\n_Carson Daily Bugle_. The date struck him first. It was the wrong date;\nit was three weeks ago. He dropped it and picked up another, a Reno\npaper this time. Same trouble with the date. He read the headline then:\n\n                        REDS STRIKE AT TURKEY!\n                           Unveil New Weapon\n\nHe blinked at it. There was a little more--pitifully little--to the\neffect that Congress had been asked for a declaration of war in order\nto defend the assaulted member of the Atlantic Pact nations.\n\nGannett swallowed hard. He dropped the paper and turned to the clerk\nwho was leaning over the glass counter watching him.\n\n\"Jeez!\" Gannett said. \"When did all this happen? I didn't even know\nabout it.\"\n\nHe didn't get any answer from the clerk. He knew he wouldn't from the\nway the clerk's eyes looked. They looked as if they should have been\nunder refrigeration.\n\n\"People around dead,\" he muttered. \"By God, the Governor oughta know\nabout this!\"\n\nHe left the drugstore and drove straight for the State Capitol\nBuilding, which wasn't far away, for Carson City isn't very large. He\nwalked up the long concrete ribbon to the big stone steps. He mounted\nthem. He stood before the bronze doors for an instant, a feeling of awe\ncoming over him despite what he knew he was going to tell the Governor.\nHe pulled on the handle of the nearest of the bronze doors.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nIt was locked, of course. The Capitol is never open at three A.M.\n(which was the exact time when it had happened three weeks ago--but he\ndidn't know that).\n\nA feeling of rage came over Gannett slowly, like heat radiating through\nsoft wood. He stood on the stone steps and faced the broad expanse of\nlawn, which, in the summertime, at least, was very lovely. He slowly\npulled his leather bag of gold from his coat pocket and raised it up\nso he could see it. Then he turned once more to the bronze doors and\nsmashed the bag of gold through one of the glass panes.\n\n\"Gannett done it!\" he roared. \"If anybody wants to know, tell them\nGannett, by God!\"\n\nHe went back to his jeep. The big, darkly hulking form of the red\nbrick Post Office Building went by and faded into the night. He passed\na jewelry store. He looked in. An electric mantel clock in the store\nwindow indicated the time as nine-ten. He passed a supermarket. The\nbig illuminated clock on the facade said nine-seven. The clock in the\nservice station, where he finally pulled in for gas, pointed at nine\nexactly. Cycles have to be controlled if electric clocks are to keep\ncorrect time, but that was something else he did not know.\n\nAfter he put back the gasoline hose, he left one more observation on\nthe silence of the night before driving to Reno. He said it loudly, and\nthere was angry frustration in every word of it:\n\n\"Hell with Carson City. To _hell_ with it!\"\n\n\n\nApproaching downtown Reno at night is a pleasant, cheerful experience.\nThere are lights all around, like a store selling electric fixtures. On\nthe right hand side of Virginia Street they glow brightly, each one a\nlittle gaudier than the last. Big lights. Neon lights in all the colors\nneon lights can come in. Signs on the fronts of the big gaming houses\nthat stay open until lights aren't needed any more; and the one flash\nof light across Virginia Street at the intersection of Commercial Row\nwhich had been photographed more times than the mind of man could have\nconjectured:\n\n                                 RENO\n                 The Biggest Little City in the World\n\nHe drove slowly by the Happy Times Club. He could see quite a few\npeople inside. You wouldn't think there was anything wrong when you\nlooked at something like that.\n\nAt the corner of First Street, he stopped for the signal. He pulled\naround a military vehicle that seemed to be waiting for the signal,\ntoo. It was an open vehicle, painted the olive drab of the Army, and\nsitting stiffly erect behind the wheel was a natty-looking first\nlieutenant with his cap at just the right angle over one eye.\n\nThe signal bell up on the corner poles clanged loudly and the lights\nturned green. Gannett crossed the intersection, but the lieutenant and\nhis military vehicle stayed behind.\n\nHe went by the Golden Bubble, which was perhaps the largest and\ngaudiest of all the gaming places in Reno. Its big front, done in\nglass bricks with multicolored lights behind them, looked like some\nmonstrous kaleidoscope built for the use of the Man in the Moon. Seen\nfrom his jeep, through the plate glass of the wide door, the interior\nof the Golden Bubble seemed to be a happy, carousing place full of the\njoyous laughter of folks having a fine time. Only that wasn't so, of\ncourse, for the only sounds to be heard were the jeep's motor and the\nsignal bells on the corner poles.\n\nGannett parked. He walked back, went slowly through the doors of the\nGolden Bubble. The first thing that met his eyes was the flashing\nwelcome grin of the head waiter, who was dressed in a tuxedo just\ninside the doors. The head waiter had his hand half out, as if to shake\nthe hand of Gannett as he came in. Gannett almost stuck out his own\nhand in return--but not quite.\n\nHe went to the bar. He didn't look at the barman lying on the floor\nwith his ear in the spittoon. He shambled around the end of the bar,\ntook a full bottle of scotch off the backbar shelf, broke the seal and\ntook a long swallow. The bartender didn't notice.\n\nAfter that he took the bottle with him out on the floor. He went around\na man in an overcoat who looked to be uncomfortably warm but wasn't.\nHe went over to a roulette table and stared the croupier straight in\nthe eyes. He reached for a pile of chips under the croupier's right\nhand and slid them over.\n\n\"Double zero,\" he said.\n\nThe croupier looked bored, which was the way a croupier should look.\nGannett reached down and gave the wheel a spin and then stood back\nand waited. The croupier waited. Two women and one man, on Gannett's\nright, also waited. The ball clicked merrily, came to a stop. The wheel\nslowed, finally rested.\n\nIt wasn't double zero. Gannett reached for the croupier's rake and\nshoved his pile of chips back under the croupier's protecting right\nhand.\n\n\"Lousy wheel is fixed,\" Gannett said.\n\nNobody argued with him on that.\n\nHe uncorked his scotch bottle and took a long pull. Nobody objected to\nthat, either, the croupier still looked bored; and the two women and\nthe one man waited patiently for the Day of Judgment.\n\nGannett went over to a cashier window and reached in and got a handful\nof silver dollars. He took them to the machines over against the far\nwall and stuck in a couple and pulled the two handles simultaneously.\nFor his investment he got back five dollars, which one of the machines\ndisgorged with a loud clatter. He put more dollars in. He put them\nin fast and pulled the levers fast. He went down the entire row of\nmachines and pulled the levers as he went. He didn't linger to see what\nhappened at any of them.\n\nHe began to feel cold. He took out his scotch bottle again and\nhalf emptied it. A woman who looked as if she were someone's\ngreat-grandmother, except that her hair was bleached and fingernails\nwere sharp talons, and who sat in a chrome and leather chair not six\nfeet away from him, stared a little disapprovingly. Gannett caught the\nlook.\n\n\"Lady,\" he said defensively, \"I earned me a holiday, see? It's none of\nyour business if I do some celebrating, is it?\"\n\nThe lady didn't change her mind. She looked as though she might prefer\ngin herself.\n\nGannett belched. He wasn't so cold now. He threw back his head and\nlaughed and listened to the sound of it bounce off walls. He did it\nagain. He was feeling fine.\n\nHe went back to the roulette wheel, got around behind it and nudged the\ncroupier gently. The croupier went over like a broom sliding down the\nside of a wall.\n\nGannett picked up the little plastic rake and looked at the two women\nand one man.\n\n\"Place your bets, folks,\" he said, in a low tone that was a pretty good\nimitation of the drone of a professional man.\n\nHe separated the chips into four neat piles. He pushed a pile each at\nthe two women, one to the man. The last he kept for himself.\n\n\"Place your bets, folks,\" he repeated.\n\nNobody did, but that was okay anyhow. Grinning happily, he made bets\nfor them. One of the women--the one that was redheaded--looked to him\nas if she might be a plunger. He shoved her pile of chips over onto\nzero and then he gave her a friendly little wink. The other woman was\nthe careful type, he thought. Her chips--not all of them, of course--he\nshoved for red. He disposed of the man perfunctorily: ten dollars on\nplain number nine. His own bet was due a little more deliberation. He\ncarefully spread around five hundred dollars until the strip looked as\nif eighteen people were playing it all at once.\n\nThe effort made him sweat. He reached for his bottle, emptied it, then\ndropped it on the fallen croupier.\n\n\"Folks,\" Gannett said in an apologetic tone, \"you'll have to pardon me\na minute. It seems I'm out of fuel. Don't go away; I'll be right back.\"\n\nEverybody was agreeable. Gannett went back to the bar, went around\nbehind it.\n\nHe said to the barman: \"I got a party out there, Doc. A big party, see?\nThe house might stand to make a mint. How's about drinks?\"\n\nThe barman considered it. The barman was still considering it when\nGannett went back to the wheel with a fifth of scotch and four glasses\nand a dish of olives. He made drinks. In each one he put an olive. By\nthis time, of course, he was getting a little loud, but nobody could\nblame him for that. When the drinks were made and placed before the two\nwomen and the man, he was ready. He grinned around, rubbed his hands\ntogether and winked a sly little leering wink at the redhead.\n\nThe wheel spun, stopped. Zero. The redhead had brought down the house.\n\n\"By God!\" whispered Gannett in frank admiration. \"Lady, you sure got\nluck. 'Nother little snifter just to nail it tight?\"\n\nGannett liked the idea. He drank her drink for her and made a face\nover the olive. He poured another. He made more bets for everybody and\nthen thought of something. Excusing himself once more, he got a roll\nof quarters from the cashier cage and, breaking it open, fed them into\na big glittering juke box over in the corner. That done, he pushed\ndown a row of tabs and went back to the table.\n\nEverybody seemed to be having a time. The redhead just couldn't lose.\nThree separate times Gannett was forced to collect chips from other\ntables in order to keep the game going, but he didn't mind. He even\nsaid to the redhead once:\n\n\"Lady, ten more minutes and we sign the joint over to you. But have\nfun; you're doing swell.\"\n\nOnce more he consulted the thoughtful barman, and more than once he had\nto go back to the juke box and punch tabs, but that was all right. He\nliked music.\n\nAt ten minutes past three in the morning, with all the chips in the\nplace before the lucky redhead he finished his last bottle.\n\nHe lifted his eyes and considered a crystal chandelier which hung from\nthe exact center of the broad ceiling. It was a beautiful chandelier.\nIt looked as though it might have graced the banquet hall of some\ncastle over in England, back in the days when England was a tight\nlittle isle. He grinned appreciatively at it. He pitched the empty\nbottle upward.\n\nThere was a crash. Half the lights in the place went out.\n\nBowing solemnly to the scattered immobile figures, Gannett lurched to\nthe big door up front. He tried a bow to the friendly floorman, but\nit didn't quite go over. He banged through the doors and out into the\nstreet.\n\n\n\nGannett groaned his aching body out of bed and padded heavily to the\nwindow. He put his big hands on the sill and looked out. Purple snow\nwas falling on a quiet world. The flakes came down softly, big wet,\ncolored things like fluffy bits of cotton candy escaping from a circus\nin the sky. There was his jeep down on the street where he had left it.\nHe could recognize it, for it was the only jeep on the block.\n\n\"Then it wasn't no lousy dream,\" he said miserably.\n\nHe went back to the bed and sat down on the edge of it. He recalled the\nheadlines in the paper.\n\n\"Them lousy Reds,\" he whispered. \"They done this, sure as hell.\"\n\nThat made him think a little. Everybody was dead, even the redhead in\nthe Golden Bubble who couldn't lose.\n\n\"What the hell am I doin' alive, then?\" he asked himself.\n\nThere was no answer to that. He thought of his mine, _The Lousy\nDisappointment_, and wondered if, living most of the time below the\nsurface as he did, he had been protected from some sort of purple gas\nor something that seemed to have killed off everybody else. It could\nbe. Some very light gas, maybe, that wouldn't seep below the surface.\n\n\"Aw, for cripe sakes!\" he grunted disgustedly.\n\nHe dressed and left the room. He went downstairs. There was the lobby,\nall soft, quiet carpeting and soft, quiet furniture and soft, quiet\ndrapes. A sheet of paper on a writing desk said _Grand Pachappa_. He\nwas in a hotel, then. He must have wandered into it after he left the\nGolden Bubble.\n\nHe carefully avoided looking at two well-dressed women who sat in\nlobby chairs, staring off into nothing, but he felt their presence\nchillingly. He shivered. He made his way outside, the purple snow\ncoming down and giving his cheeks wet, cold caresses. He angrily\nbrushed them off, but they came down anyway. Above the snow, the sky\nwas a sodden mass of purplish gray.\n\nHe found a restaurant that was open. A few customers sat on the stools\nlike statues in a museum. All the coffeemakers were on the electric\nstove, but they were dry and clean except one that had no bottom in it\nany more and was quite discolored. Beneath it, the round electric coil\nstill glowed faithfully.\n\nHe grabbed up one of the clean pots and took it to the metal rinse\nsink and reached for the faucet. And then his hand froze. What if the\nwater was tainted? He had no way of finding out if it didn't carry that\nidentifying purplish tint. He tried the faucet. It did.\n\nThe milk in the refrigerator was three weeks old, of course. Gannett\nended by opening a bottle of Pepsi Cola for breakfast.\n\nThe sky stayed leaden, but even so there were many things apparent\nnow that he hadn't seen the night before. A lack of heavy traffic on\nthe streets would seem to indicate that what had happened--purple gas\nor whatever--had been very late at night; even so, traffic accidents\nwere everywhere. There was one big sedan with its front end crushed\nagainst the First Olympic Bank. There was one cop who had died trying\nto tie his right shoe--his fingers still clutched the laces. There was\na doctor (his car had a caduceus emblem on the windshield) who had just\nstepped down to the street, his bag in his left hand and his right hand\non the door, ready to slam it shut. He had a serious, purposeful look\non his face that even the falling purple snow couldn't quite eradicate.\n\nDespite the cold, sweat frosted Gannett's forehead. He made his way\nto a radio and television store and kicked in a glass panel of the\nfront door. Stepping through to the clamor of the suddenly aroused\nnight-warning bell, he went directly to a TV set and turned it on.\n\nThe big screen tube flickered after a while and a scratching hum came\nout of the speaker, but nothing happened. He tried all the channels.\nNothing.\n\nHe tuned in a big radio console next, going carefully and slowly across\nthe dial with a hand that shook. Even though the night-warning bell was\nkicking up quite a racket, he could tell after a moment or two.\n\nNothing....\n\n\n\nThe sky was getting dark as Gannett left the store. The purple snow\nstill fell. It was then that he noticed for the first time the gay\nstreet decorations in preparation for Christmas. Big paper bells with\nplenty of glittering tinsel and electric lamps inside them.\n\nOn the corner of First and Virginia, he saw a big iron kettle of some\nSalvation Army Santa. Hanging from its metal tripod, it looked quite\nnatural, except that it was filled with purple snow; and the Santa who\nwas supposed to ring his little bell was holding it stiffly over his\nhead. He and the bell were frozen silent.\n\nThere was a large department store. Inside, in the show window, was\na Christmas display that would delight the kiddies. There was a big\nChristmas tree trimmed with every imaginable ornament.\n\nBeneath the tree, electrically activated toy soldiers jerked robotlike\nthrough their precise military designations, their lithographed faces\nlooking stern and very brave. There was a clown who did uncounted\nsomersaults; a lifelike doll who clapped her hands in glee. There was\nan aluminum bomber with a wing-spread of three feet--it was held in the\nair by almost invisible wires--and its six propellers droned in perfect\nunison, making a brisk little wash that rustled the silk of the little\ndoll's dress. And around the base of the tree, through valley and over\nmountain, into tunnel and over spiderweb trestle, was a railroad track.\nIt should have had busy little trains on it, except that it didn't--the\ntrains had been derailed at a whistle stop called North Pole.\n\nGannett's eyes twitched.\n\nThe sky grew darker; the purple snow continued to fall silently.\nGannett went by the Masonic Lodge, the YMCA, and crossed the little\nstone bridge over the frozen Truckee River. He came to the heavy gray\nstone building of First Community Church.\n\nHe stopped in front of the church and stared at it. It was a solid,\nrespectable-looking building. It was a very nice thing, indeed, to have\nhere in Reno.\n\n\"Christmas Eve,\" Gannett whispered through cold lips. \"This is\nChristmas Eve!\"\n\nHe went up six purple-snow covered stone steps. He reached the top\nwhere the stone steps ended and where the big square stone slab was,\nthat slab where the minister stands when the weather is fair, and\nshakes hands with the congregation after the service.\n\nSomewhere above, in the steeple, bells struck off the hour of eight. A\ntiming device did that. Many churches had such timing devices to save\nlabor. And as though that were a signal, a loudspeaker, attached way up\non the spire especially for this festive season, began to growl out\npreparatory scratching noises, like a big metal monster clearing its\nthroat.\n\nGannett pulled on the wrought brass handles of the closed oaken door.\nThe door didn't budge. He grabbed the handles in both hands and braced\nhis feet. He pulled hard. The door was locked.\n\n\"God,\" he whispered hoarsely. \"God, this is me. I gotta get in, God.\nGod, listen, _I gotta get in_!\"\n\nHigh above, in the steeple, the loudspeaker was finally ready with a\ncheerful little carol.\n\n\"_God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen!_\" the voices of a dead choir roared out\nupon the silent city.\n\n\n\n\n",
