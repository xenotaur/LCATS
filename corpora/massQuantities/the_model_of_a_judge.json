Uneasiness spoke in their awkward hurried motions\nwhen they came near him; fear looked out of their eyes. He had to\nreassure himself that all this would pass. In time they'd learn to\nregard him as one of themselves and cease to recall what he had once\nbeen. For the time being, however, they still remembered. And so did he.\n\nMrs. Claymore, of the Presiding Committee, was babbling, \"Oh, Mrs.\nSilver, it's so good of you to come. Have you entered the contest?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" said Mrs. Silver with a modest laugh. \"Of course I don't\nexpect to win against so many fine women who are taking part. But I just\nthought I'd enter to--to keep things interesting.\"\n\n\"That was very kind of you. But don't talk about not winning. I still\nremember some of the dishes you served for dinner at your home that time\nGeorge and I paid you a visit. Mmmmm--they were really delicious.\"\n\nMrs. Silver uttered another little laugh. \"Just ordinary recipes. I'm so\nglad you liked them, though.\"\n\n\"I certainly did. And I'm sure the judge will like your cake, too.\"\n\n\"The judge? Don't you usually have a committee?\"\n\n\n\nHe could hear every word. They had no idea how sharp his sense of\nhearing was, and he had no desire to disconcert them further by letting\nthem know. He could hear every conversation taking place in ordinary\ntones in the large reception room. When he concentrated he could make\nout the whispers. At this point he had to concentrate, for Mrs. Claymore\nleaned over and breathed into her friend's attentive ear.\n\n\"My dear, haven't you heard? We've had such trouble with that\ncommittee--there were such charges of favoritism! It was really awful.\"\n\n\"Really? But how did you find a judge then?\"\n\n\"Don't look now--no, I'll tell you what to do. Pretend I said something\nfunny, and throw your head back and laugh. Take a quick glance at him\nwhile you do. He's sitting up there alone, on the platform.\"\n\nMrs. Silver laughed gracefully as directed, and her eyes swept the\nplatform. She became so excited, she almost forgot to whisper.\n\n\"Why, he's--\"\n\n\"Shhh. Lower your voice, my dear.\"\n\n\"Why--he isn't human!\"\n\n\"He's supposed to be--now. But, of course, that's a matter of opinion!\"\n\n\"But who on Earth thought of making him judge?\"\n\n\"No one on Earth. Professor Halder, who lives over on that big asteroid\nthe other side of yours, heard of the troubles we had, and came up with\nthe suggestion. At first it seemed absurd--\"\n\n\"It certainly seems absurd to me!\" agreed Mrs. Silver.\n\n\"It was the only thing we could do. There was no one else we could\ntrust.\"\n\n\"But what does he know about cakes?\"\n\n\"My dear, he has the most exquisite sense of taste!\"\n\n\"I still don't understand.\"\n\n\"It's superhuman. Before we adopted Professor Halder's suggestion, we\ngave him a few tests. The results simply left us gasping. We could mix\nall sorts of spices--the most delicate, most exotic herbs from Venus or\nMars, and the strongest, coarsest flavors from Earth or one of the\nplant-growing asteroids--and he could tell us everything we had added,\nand exactly how much.\"\n\n\n\n\"I find that hard to believe, Matilda.\"\n\n\"Isn't it? It's honestly incredible. If I hadn't seen him do it myself,\nI wouldn't have believed it.\"\n\n\"But he doesn't have human preferences. Wasn't he--wasn't he--\"\n\n\"Carnivorous? Oh, yes. They say he was the most vicious creature\nimaginable. Let an animal come within a mile of him, and he'd scent it\nand be after it in a flash. He and the others of his kind made the moon\nhe came from uninhabitable for any other kind of intelligent life. Come\nto think of it, it may have been the very moon we're on now!\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Either this, or some other moon of Saturn's. We had to do something\nabout it. We didn't want to kill them off, naturally; that would have\nbeen the easiest way, but so uncivilized! Finally, our scientists came\nup with the suggestion for psychological reforming. Professor Halder\ntold us how difficult it all was, but it seems to have worked. In his\ncase, at least.\"\n\nMrs. Silver stole another glance. \"Did it? I don't notice any one going\nnear him.\"\n\n\"Oh, we don't like to tempt fate, Clara. But, if there were really any\ndanger, I'm sure the psychologists would never have let him out of their\nclutches.\"\n\n\"I hope not. But psychologists take the most reckless risks\nsometimes--with other people's lives!\"\n\n\"Well, there's one psychologist who's risking his own life--and his own\nwife, too. You know Dr. Cabanis, don't you?\"\n\n\"Only by sight. Isn't his wife that stuck-up thing?\"\n\n\"That's the one. Dr. Cabanis is the man who had actual charge of\nreforming him. And he's going to be here. His wife is entering a cake.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me that she really expects to win!\"\n\n\"She bakes well, my dear. Let's give the she-devil her due. How on Earth\nan intelligent man like Dr. Cabanis can stand her, I don't know, but,\nafter all, he's the psychologist, not I, and he could probably explain\nit better than I could.\"\n\n\n\nRonar disengaged his attention.\n\nSo Dr. Cabanis was here. He looked around, but the psychologist was not\nin sight. He would probably arrive later.\n\nThe thought stirred a strange mixture of emotions. Some of the most\npainful moments of his life were associated with the presence of Dr.\nCabanis. His early life, the life of a predatory carnivore, had been an\nunthinkingly happy one. He supposed that he could call his present life\na happy one too, if you weren't overly particular how you defined the\nterm. But that period in between!\n\nThat had been, to say the least, painful. Those long sessions with Dr.\nCabanis had stirred him to the depths of a soul he hadn't known he\npossessed. The electric shocks and the druggings he hadn't minded so\nmuch. But the gradual reshaping of his entire psyche, the period of\nbasic instruction, in which he had been taught to hate his old life so\ngreatly that he could no longer go back to it even if the way were open,\nand the conditioning for a new and useful life with human beings--that\nwas torture of the purest kind.\n\nIf he had known what was ahead of him, he wouldn't have gone through it\nat all. He'd have fought until he dropped, as so many of the others like\nhim did. Still, now that it was over, he supposed that the results were\nworth the pain. He had a position that was more important than it seemed\nat first glance. He exercised control over a good part of the food\nsupply intended for the outer planets, and his word was trusted\nimplicitly. Let him condemn an intended shipment, and cancellation\nfollowed automatically, without the formality of confirmation by\nlaboratory tests. He was greatly admired. And feared.\n\nThey had other feelings about him too. He overheard one whisper that\nsurprised him. \"My dear, I think he's really handsome.\"\n\n\"But, Charlotte, how can you say that about someone who isn't even\nhuman!\"\n\n\"He looks more human than many human beings do. And his clothes fit him\nbeautifully. I wonder--does he have a tail?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" There was disappointment in the sound. \"He looks like a pirate.\"\n\n\"He was a kind of wolf, they tell me. You'd never guess, to see him,\nthat he ran on all fours, would you?\"\n\n\"Of course not. He's so straight and dignified.\"\n\n\"It just shows you what psychology can do.\"\n\n\n\n\"Psychology, and a series of operations, dear ladies,\" he thought\nsarcastically. \"Without them I wouldn't be able to stand so nice and\nstraight with the help of all the psychologists in this pretty little\nsolar system of ours.\"\n\nFrom behind a potted Martian nut-cactus came two low voices--not\nwhispers this time. And there was several octaves difference in pitch\nbetween them. One male, one female.\n\nThe man said, \"Don't be worried, sweetheart. I'll match your cooking and\nbaking against anybody's.\"\n\nThere was a curious sound, between a click and a hiss. What human beings\ncalled a kiss, he thought. Between the sexes, usually an indication of\naffection or passion. Sometimes, especially within the ranks of the\nfemale sex, a formality behind which warfare could be waged.\n\nThe girl said tremulously, \"But these women have so much experience.\nThey've cooked and baked for years.\"\n\n\"Haven't you, for your own family?\"\n\n\"Yes, but that isn't the same thing. I had to learn from a cookbook. And\nI had no one with experience to stand over me and teach me.\"\n\n\"You've learned faster that way than you'd have done with some of these\nold hens standing at your elbow and giving you directions. You cook too\nwell. I'll be fat in no time.\"\n\n\"Your mother doesn't think so. And your brother said something about a\nbride's biscuits--\"\n\n\"The older the joke, the better Charles likes it. Don't let it worry\nyou.\" He kissed her again. \"Have confidence in yourself, dear. You're\ngoing to win.\"\n\n\"Oh, Gregory, it's awfully nice of you to say so, but really I feel so\nunsure of myself.\"\n\n\"If only the judge were human and took a look at you, nobody else would\nstand a chance. Have I told you within the last five minutes that you're\nbeautiful?\"\n\n\n\nRonar disengaged his attention again. He found human love-making as\nrepulsive as most human food.\n\nHe picked up a few more whispers. And then Dr. Cabanis came in.\n\nThe good doctor looked around, smiled, greeted several ladies of his\nacquaintance as if he were witnessing a private strip-tease of their\nsouls, and then came directly up to the platform. \"How are you, Ronar?\"\n\n\"Fine, Doctor. Are you here to keep an eye on me?\"\n\n\"I hardly think that's necessary. I have an interest in the results of\nthe judging. My wife has baked a cake.\"\n\n\"I had no idea that cake-baking was so popular a human avocation.\"\n\n\"Anything that requires skill is sure to become popular among us. By the\nway, Ronar, I hope you don't feel hurt.\"\n\n\"Hurt, Doctor? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Come now, you understand me well enough. These people still don't trust\nyou. I can tell by the way they keep their distance.\"\n\n\"I take human frailty into account, Doctor. Frailty, and lack of\nopportunity. These men and women haven't had the opportunity for\nextensive psychological treatment that I've had. I don't expect too much\nof them.\"\n\n\"You've scored a point there, Ronar.\"\n\n\"Isn't there something that can be done for them, Doctor? Some treatment\nthat it would be legal to give them?\"\n\n\"It would have to be voluntary. You see, Ronar, you were considered only\nan animal, and treatment was necessary to save your life. But these\npeople are supposed to have rights. One of their rights is to be left\nalone with their infirmities. Besides, none of them are seriously ill.\nThey hurt no one.\"\n\nFor a second Ronar had a human temptation. It was on the tip of his\ntongue to say, \"Your wife too, Doctor? People wonder how you stand her.\"\nBut he resisted it. He had resisted more serious temptations.\n\n\n\nA gong sounded gently but pervasively. Dr. Cabanis said, \"I hope you\nhave no resentment against me at this stage of the game, Ronar. I'd hate\nto have my wife lose the prize because the judge was prejudiced.\"\n\n\"Have no fear, Doctor. I take professional pride in my work. I will\nchoose only the best.\"\n\n\"Of course, the fact that the cakes are numbered and not signed with the\nnames of their creators will make things simpler.\"\n\n\"That would matter with human judges. It does not affect me.\"\n\nAnother gong sounded, more loudly this time. Gradually the conversation\nstopped. A man in a full dress suit, with yellow stripes down the sides\nof his shorts, and tails hanging both front and rear, climbed up on the\nplatform. His eyes shone with a greeting so warm that the fear was\nalmost completely hidden. \"How are you, Ronar? Glad to see you.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Senator. And you?\"\n\n\"Couldn't be better. Have a cigar.\"\n\n\"No, thank you. I don't smoke.\"\n\n\"That's right, you don't. Besides, I'd be wasting the cigar. You don't\nvote!\" He laughed heartily.\n\n\"I understand that they're passing a special law to let--people--like me\nvote at the next election.\"\n\n\"I'm for it, Ronar, I'm for it. You can count on me.\"\n\nThe chairman came up on the platform, a stout and dignified woman who\nsmiled at both Ronar and the Senator, and shook hands with both without\nshowing signs of distaste for either. The assembled competitors and\nspectators took seats.\n\nThe chairman cleared her throat. \"Ladies and gentlemen, let us open this\nmeeting by singing the _Hymn of All Planets_.\"\n\n\n\nThey all rose, Ronar with them. His voice wasn't too well adapted to\nsinging, but neither, it seemed, were most of the human voices. And, at\nleast, he knew all the words.\n\nThe chairman proceeded to greet the gathering formally, in the name of\nthe Presiding Committee.\n\nThen she introduced Senator Whitten. She referred archly to the fact\nthat the Senator had long since reached the age of indiscretion and had\nso far escaped marriage. He was an enemy of the female sex, but they'd\nlet him speak to them anyway.\n\nSenator Whitten just as archly took up the challenge. He had escaped\nmore by good luck--if you could call it good--than by good management.\nBut he was sure that if he had ever had the fortune to encounter some of\nthe beautiful ladies here this fine day, and to taste the products of\ntheir splendid cooking and baking, he would have been a lost man. He\nwould long since have committed polygamy.\n\nSenator Whitten then launched into a paean of praise for the ancient art\nof preparing food.\n\nRonar's attention wandered. So did that of a good part of the audience.\nHis ears picked up another conversation, this time whispered between a\nman and a woman in the front row.\n\nThe man said, \"I should have put your name on it, instead of mine.\"\n\n\"That would have been silly. All my friends know that I can't bake. And\nit would look so strange if I won.\"\n\n\"It'll look stranger if I win. I can imagine what the boys in the shop\nwill say.\"\n\n\"Oh, the boys in the shop are stupid. What's so unmanly in being able to\ncook and bake?\"\n\n\"I'm not anxious for the news to get around.\"\n\n\"Some of the best chefs have been men.\"\n\n\"I'm not a chef.\"\n\n\"Stop worrying.\" There was exasperation in the force of her whisper.\n\"You won't win anyway.\"\n\n\"I don't know. Sheila--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"If I win, will you explain to everybody how manly I really am? Will you\nbe my character witness?\"\n\nShe repressed a giggle.\n\n\"If you won't help me, I'll have to go around giving proof myself.\"\n\n\"Shh, someone will hear you.\"\n\nSenator Whitten went on and on.\n\n\n\nRonar thought back to the time when he had wandered over the surface of\nthis, his native satellite. He no longer had the old desires, the old\nappetites. Only the faintest of ghosts still persisted, ghosts with no\npower to do harm. But he could remember the old feeling of pleasure, the\ndelight of sinking his teeth into an animal he had brought down himself,\nthe savage joy of gulping the tasty flesh. He didn't eat raw meat any\nmore; he didn't eat meat at all. He had been conditioned against it. He\nwas now half vegetarian, half synthetarian. His meals were nourishing,\nhealthful, and a part of his life he would rather not think about.\n\nHe took no real pleasure in the tasting of the cakes and other\ndelicacies that born human beings favored. His sense of taste had\nremained keen only to the advantage of others. To himself it was a\ntantalizing mockery.\n\nSenator Whitten's voice came to a sudden stop. There was applause. The\nSenator sat down; the chairman stood up. The time for the judging had\narrived.\n\nThey set out the cakes--more than a hundred of them, topped by icings of\nall colors and all flavors. The chairman introduced Ronar and lauded\nboth his impartiality and the keenness of his sense of taste.\n\nThey had a judging card ready. Slowly, Ronar began to go down the line.\n\nThey might just as well have signed each cake with its maker's name. As\nhe lifted a portion of each to his mouth, he could hear the quick intake\nof breath from the woman who had baked it, could catch the whispered\nwarning from her companion. There were few secrets they could keep from\nhim.\n\nAt first they all watched intently. When he had reached the fifth cake,\nhowever, a hand went up in the audience. \"Madam Chairman!\"\n\n\"Please, ladies, let us not interrupt the judging.\"\n\n\"But I don't think the judging is right. Mr. Ronar tastes hardly more\nthan a crumb of each!\"\n\n\"A minimum of three crumbs,\" Ronar corrected her. \"One from the body of\nthe cake, one from the icing, and an additional crumb from each filling\nbetween layers.\"\n\n\"But you can't judge a cake that way! You have to eat it, take a whole\nmouthful--\"\n\n\"Please, madam, permit me to explain. A crumb is all I need. I can\nanalyze the contents of the cake sufficiently well from that. Let me\ntake for instance Cake Number 4, made from an excellent recipe, well\nbaked. Martian granis flour, goover eggs, tingan-flavored salt, a trace\nof Venusian orange spice, synthetic shortening of the best quality. The\nicing is excellent, made with rare dipentose sugars which give it a\ndelightful flavor. Unfortunately, however, the cake will not win first\nprize.\"\n\nAn anguished cry rose from the audience. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Through no fault of your own, dear lady. The purberries used in making\nthe filling were not freshly picked. They have the characteristic flavor\nof refrigeration.\"\n\n\"The manager of the store swore to me that they were fresh! Oh, I'll\nkill him, I'll murder him--\"\n\nShe broke down in a flood of tears.\n\n\n\nRonar said to the lady who had protested, \"I trust, madam, that you will\nnow have slightly greater confidence in my judgment.\"\n\nShe blushed and subsided.\n\nRonar went on with the testing. Ninety per cent of the cakes he was able\nto discard at once, from some fault in the raw materials used or in the\nmethod of baking. Eleven cakes survived the first elimination contest.\n\nHe went over them again, more slowly this time. When he had completed\nthe second round of tests, only three were left. Number 17 belonged to\nMrs. Cabanis. Number 43 had been made by the man who argued with his\nwife. Number 64 was the product of the young bride, whom he had still\nnot seen.\n\nRonar paused. \"My sense of taste is somewhat fatigued. I shall have to\nask for a short recess before proceeding further.\"\n\nThere was a sigh from the audience. The tension was not released, it was\nmerely relaxed for a short interval.\n\nRonar said to the chairman, \"I should like a few moments of fresh air.\nThat will restore me. Do you mind?\"\n\n\"Of course not, Mr. Ronar.\"\n\nHe went outside. Seen through the thin layer of air which surrounded the\ngroup of buildings, and the plastic bubble which kept the air from\nescaping into space, the stars were brilliant and peaceful. The Sun, far\naway, was like a father star who was too kind to obliterate his\nchildren. Strange, he thought, to recall that this was his native\nsatellite. A few years ago it had been a different world. As for\nhimself, he could live just as well outside the bubble as in it, as well\nin rarefied air as in dense. Suppose he were to tear a hole in the\nplastic--\n\nForbidden thoughts. He checked himself, and concentrated on the three\ncakes and the three contestants.\n\n\"You aren't supposed to let personal feelings interfere. You aren't even\nsupposed to know who baked those cakes. But you know, all right. And you\ncan't keep personal feelings from influencing your judgment.\n\n\"Any one of the cakes is good enough to win. Choose whichever you\nplease, and no one will have a right to criticize. To which are you\ngoing to award the prize?\n\n\"Number 17? Mrs. Cabanis is, as one of the other women has so aptly\ntermed her, a bitch on wheels. If she wins, she'll be insufferable. And\nshe'll probably make her husband suffer. Not that he doesn't deserve it.\nStill, he thought he was doing me a favor. Will I be doing him a favor\nif I have his wife win?\n\n\"Number 64, now, is insufferable in her own right. That loving\nconversation with her husband would probably disgust even human ears. On\nthe other hand, there is this to be said for her winning, it will make\nthe other women furious. To think that a young snip, just married,\nwithout real experience in home-making, should walk away with a prize of\nthis kind!\n\n\"Ah, but if the idea is to burn them up, why not give the prize to\nNumber 43? They'd be ready to drop dead with chagrin. To think that a\nmere man should beat them at their own specialty! They'd never be able\nto hold their heads up again. The man wouldn't feel too happy about it,\neither. Yes, if it's a matter of getting back at these humans for the\nthings they've done to me, if it's a question of showing them what I\nreally think of them, Number 43 should get it.\n\n\"On the other hand, I'm supposed to be a model of fairness. That's why I\ngot the job in the first place. Remember, Ronar? Come on, let's go in\nand try tasting them again. Eat a mouthful of each cake, much as you\nhate the stuff. Choose the best on its merits.\"\n\n\n\nThey were babbling when he walked in, but the babbling stopped quickly.\nThe chairman said, \"Are we ready, Mr. Ronar?\"\n\n\"All ready.\"\n\nThe three cakes were placed before him. Slowly he took a mouthful of\nNumber 17. Slowly he chewed it and swallowed it. Number 43 followed,\nthen Number 64.\n\nAfter the third mouthful, he stood lost in thought. One was practically\nas good as another. He could still choose which he pleased.\n\nThe assemblage had quieted down. Only the people most concerned\nwhispered nervously.\n\nMrs. Cabanis, to her psychologist husband: \"If I don't win, it'll be\nyour fault. I'll pay you back for this.\"\n\nThe good doctor's fault? Yes, you could figure it that way if you wanted\nto. If not for Dr. Cabanis, Ronar wouldn't be the judge. If Ronar\nweren't the judge, Mrs. C. would win, she thought. Hence it was all her\nhusband's fault. Q.E.D.\n\nThe male baker to his wife: \"If he gives the prize to me, I'll brain\nhim. I should never have entered this.\"\n\n\"It's too late to worry now.\"\n\n\"I could yell 'Fire',\" he whispered hopefully. \"I could create a panic\nthat would empty the hall. And then I'd destroy my cake.\"\n\n\"Don't be foolish. And stop whispering.\"\n\nThe young post-honeymooning husband: \"You're going to win, dear; I can\nfeel it in my bones.\"\n\n\"Oh, Greg, please don't try to fool me. I've resigned myself to losing.\"\n\n\"You won't lose.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid. Put your arm around me, Greg. Hold me tight. Will you still\nlove me if I lose?\"\n\n\"Mmmm.\" He kissed her shoulder. \"You know, I didn't fall in love with\nyou for your cooking, sweetheart. You don't have to bake any cakes for\nme. You're good enough to eat yourself.\"\n\n\"He's right,\" thought Ronar, as he stared at her. \"The man's right. Not\nin the way he means, but he's right.\" And suddenly, for one second of\ndecision, Ronar's entire past seemed to flash through his mind.\n\nThe young bride never knew why she won first prize.\n\n\n\n\n",
