    "body": "The strangers landed just before dawn, incinerating a good li of bottom\nland in the process. Their machines were already busily digging up the\ntopsoil. The Old One watched, squinting into the morning sun. He\nsighed, hitched up his saffron robes and started walking down toward\nthe strangers.\n\nGriffin turned, not trying to conceal his excitement. \"You're the\nlinguist, see what you can get out of him.\"\n\n\"I might,\" Kung Su ventured sourly, \"if you'd go weed the air machine\nor something. This is going to be hard enough without a lot of\nkibitzers cramping my style and scaring Old Pruneface here half to\ndeath.\"\n\n\"I see your point,\" Griffin answered. He turned and started back toward\nthe diggings. \"Let me know it you make any progress with the local\nlanguage.\" He stopped whistling and strove to control the jauntiness of\nhis gait. _Must be the lower gravity and extra oxygen_, he thought. _I\nhaven't bounced along like this for thirty years. Nice place to settle\ndown if some promoter doesn't turn it into an old folks home._ He sighed\nand glanced over the diggings. The rammed earth walls were nearly\nobliterated by now. _Nothing lost_, he reflected. _It's all on tape\nand they're no different from a thousand others at any rate._\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nGriffin opened a door in the transparent bubble from which Alba\u00f1ez was\noperating the diggers. \"Anything?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Nothing so far,\" Alba\u00f1ez reported. \"What's the score on this job? I\nmissed the briefing.\"\n\n\"How'd you make out on III, by the way?\"\n\n\"Same old stuff, pottery shards and the usual junk. See it once and\nyou've seen it all.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Griffin began, \"it looks like the same thing here again. We've\npretty well covered this system and you know how it is. Rammed earth\nwalls here and there, pottery shards, flint, bronze and iron artifacts\nand that's it. They got to the iron age on every planet and then\nblooey.\"\n\n\"Artifacts all made for humanoid hands I suppose. I wonder if they were\nclose enough to have crossbred with humans.\"\n\n\"I couldn't say,\" Griffin observed dryly. \"From the looks of Old\nPruneface I doubt if we'll ever find a human female with sufficiently\ndetached attitude to find out.\"\n\n\"Who's Pruneface?\"\n\n\"He came ambling down out of the hills this morning and walked into\ncamp.\"\n\n\"You mean you've actually found a live humanoid?\"\n\n\"There's got to be a first time for everything.\" Griffin opened the\ndoor and started climbing the hill toward Kung Su and Pruneface.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"Well, have you gotten beyond the 'me, Charlie' stage yet?\" Griffin\ninquired at breakfast two days later.\n\nKung Su gave an inscrutable East Los Angeles smile. \"As a matter of\nfact, I'm a little farther along. Joe is amazingly co\u00f6perative.\"\n\n\"Joe?\"\n\n\"Spell it Chou if you want to be exotic. It's still pronounced Joe and\nthat's his name. The language is monosyllabic and tonal. I happen to\nknow a similar language.\"\n\n\"You mean this humanoid speaks Chinese?\" Griffin was never sure whether\nKung was ribbing him or not.\n\n\"Not Chinese. The vocabulary is different but the syntax and phonemes\nare nearly identical. I'll speak it perfectly in a week. It's just a\nquestion of memorizing two or three thousand new words. Incidentally,\nJoe wants to know why you're digging up his bottom land. He was all set\nto flood it today.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me he plants rice!\" Griffin exclaimed.\n\n\"I don't imagine it's rice, but it needs flooding whatever it is.\"\n\n\"Ask him how many humanoids there are on this planet.\"\n\n\"I'm way ahead of you, Griffin. He says there are only a few thousand\nleft. The rest were all destroyed in a war with the barbarians.\"\n\n\"Barbarians?\"\n\n\"They're extinct.\"\n\n\"How many races were there?\"\n\n\"I'll get to that if you'll stop interrupting,\" Kung rejoined testily.\n\"Joe says there are only two kinds of people, his own dark,\nstraight-haired kind and the barbarians. They have curly hair, white\nskin and round eyes. You'd pass for a barbarian, according to Joe, only\nyou don't have a faceful of hair. He wants to know how things are going\non the other planets.\"\n\n\"I suppose that's my cue to break into a cold sweat and feel a\npremonition of disaster.\" Griffin tried to smile and almost made it.\n\n\"Not necessarily, but it seems our iron-age man is fairly well informed\nin extraplanetary affairs.\"\n\n\"I guess I'd better start learning the language.\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThanks to the spade work Kung Su had done in preparing hypno-recordings,\nGriffin had a working knowledge of the Rational People's language\neleven days later when he sat down to drink herb infused hot water with\nJoe and other Old Ones in the low-roofed wooden building around which\nclustered a village of two hundred humanoids. He fidgeted through\ninterminable ritualistic cups of hot water. Eventually Joe hid his\nhands in the sleeves of his robe and turned with an air of polite\ninquiry. _Now we get down to business_, Griffin thought.\n\n\"Joe, you know by now why we're digging up your bottom land. We'll\nrecompense you in one way or another. Meanwhile, could you give me a\nlittle local history?\"\n\nJoe smiled like a well nourished bodhisattva. \"Approximately how far\nback would you like me to begin?\"\n\n\"At the beginning.\"\n\n\"How long is a year on your planet?\" Joe inquired.\n\n\"Your year is eight and a half days longer. Our day is three hundred\nheartbeats longer than yours.\"\n\nJoe nodded his thanks. \"More water?\"\n\nGriffin declined, suppressing a shudder.\n\n\"Five million years ago we were limited to one planet,\" Joe began. \"The\ncourt astronomer had a vision of our planet in flames. I imagine you'd\nsay our sun was about to nova. The empress was disturbed and ordered a\nconvocation of seers. One fasted overlong and saw an answer. As the\ndying seer predicted the Son of Heaven came with fire-breathing\ndragons. The fairest of maidens and the strongest of our young men were\ntaken to serve his warriors. We served them honestly and faithfully. A\nthousand years later their empire collapsed leaving us scattered across\nthe universe. Three thousand years later a new race of barbarians\nconquered our planets. We surrendered naturally and soon were serving\nour new masters. Five hundred years passed and they destroyed\nthemselves. This has been the pattern of our existence from that day to\nthis.\"\n\n\"You mean you've been slaves for five million years?\" Griffin was\nincredulous.\n\n\"Servitude has ever been a refuge for the scholar and the philosopher.\"\n\n\"But what point is there in such a life? Why do you continue living\nthis way?\"\n\n\"What is the point in any way of life? Continued existence. Personal\nimmortality is neither desirable nor possible. We settled for\nperpetuation of the race.\"\n\n\"But what about self-determination? You know enough astronomy to\nunderstand novae. Surely you realize it could happen again. What would\nyou do without a technology to build spaceships?\"\n\n\"Many stars have gone nova during our history. Usually the barbarians\ncame in time. When they didn't--\"\n\n\"You mean you don't really care?\"\n\n\"All barbarians ask that sooner or later,\" Joe smiled. \"Sometimes\ntoward the end they even accuse us of destroying them. We don't. Every\ntechnology bears the seeds of its own destruction. The stars are older\nthan the machinery that explores them.\"\n\n\"You used technology to get from one system to another.\"\n\n\"We used it, but we were never part of it. When machines fail, their\npeople die. We have no machines.\"\n\n\"What would you do if this sun were to nova?\"\n\n\"We can serve you. We are not unintelligent.\"\n\n\"Willing to work your way around the galaxy, eh? But what if we refused\nto take you?\"\n\n\"The race would go on. Kung Su tells me there is no life on planets of\nthis system, but there are other systems.\"\n\n\"You're whistling in the dark,\" Griffin scoffed. \"How do you know if\nany of the Rational People survive?\"\n\n\"How far back does your history go?\" Joe inquired.\n\n\"It's hard to say exactly,\" Griffin replied. \"Our earliest written\nrecords date back some seven thousand years.\"\n\n\"You are all of one race?\"\n\n\"No, you may have noticed Kung Su is slightly different from the rest\nof us.\"\n\n\"Yes, Griffin, I have noticed. When you return ask Kung Su for the\nlegend of creation. More hot water?\" Joe stirred and Griffin guessed\nthe interview was over. He drank another ritual cup, made his farewells\nand walked thoughtfully back to camp.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"Kung,\" Griffin asked over coffee next afternoon, \"how well up are you\non Chinese mythology?\"\n\n\"Oh, fair, I guess. It isn't my field but I remember some of the\nstories my grandfather used to tell me.\"\n\n\"What is your legend of creation?\" Griffin persisted.\n\n\"It's pretty well garbled but I remember something about the Son of\nHeaven bringing the early settlers from a land of two moons on the back\nof his fire-breathing dragon. The dragon got sick and died so they\ncouldn't ever get back to heaven again. There's a lot of stuff about\ndevils, too.\"\n\n\"What about devils?\"\n\n\"I don't remember too well, but they were supposed to do terrible\nthings to you and even to your unborn children if they ever caught you.\nThey must have been pretty stupid though; they couldn't turn corners.\nMy grandfather's store had devil screens at all the doors so you had to\nturn a corner to get in. The first time I saw the lead baffles at the\npile chamber doors on this ship it reminded me of home sweet home. By\nthe way, some young men from the village were around today. They want\nto work passage to the next planet. What do you think?\"\n\nGriffin was silent for a long time.\n\n\"Well, what do you say? We can use some hand labor for the delicate\ndigging. Want to put them on?\"\n\n\"Might as well.\" Griffin answered. \"There's a streetcar every\nmillennium anyway.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't understand. You sold your birthright to the barbarians.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n",
