Its great water front, whence galleys had sailed bravely forth\nin ancient days, was packed with shipping, most of it idle; for trade\nwas in the doldrums. Docked between two big \u201csmoke boats\u201d lay the very\ntrim and neat steam schooner, _Malabart_, Captain Eli Drake, owner and\ncommander; and there was nothing in the _Malabart\u2019s_ physical appearance\nto indicate that she, too, was yawning for a cargo of any sort, or to\nany port, though the charter rate might be so low as to barely pay\nexpenses. Captain Drake, whose sobriquet of \u201cThe Old Hyena\u201d had survived\nthe days of sail, was ashore, harassed by cares.\n\nHe had been eating into capital to keep his ship in commission, and his\ncrew, which he had gathered in the course of many years, from being\ndisbanded. He prized his crew and, after his ship, they came first in\nhis affections. In quest of cargo--any cargo--he had scoured the port,\nmade daily trips over the short drive to Athens, and spent liberal sums\non cablegrams to many agents, without avail. He felt like cursing the\nbig steamship companies, which, with their army of organized runners,\nwere rapidly driving the independent owners and tramps off the seas.\n\nIn a mood of sullen obstinacy he had tramped almost the length of the\ndocks when, unexpectedly, he heard the clatter of a cargo winch; and the\nsound was so unusual that, like a magnet, it drew him in its direction.\nHe found a rusty tramp that was lading.\n\n\u201cNow what--how did I miss getting that cargo?\u201d he reflected. \u201cThe\nRhodialim, eh?\u201d And after a moment\u2019s thought he muttered: \u201cOh, yes.\nBelongs to that firm of Hakim & Letin. Got her and one other schooner,\ndoing mostly Levantine and East African coast trade. Wish I could have\ngot that cargo. My luck\u2019s out.\u201d\n\nWithout thinking, or observing that at the dock gates there was a\nwatchman, who, at the moment, had his back turned and was in voluble\naltercation with one of his countrymen, Captain Eli strolled inward. He\nfinally halted, and with hands in pockets stared, suddenly discovering\nsomething else that made him curious.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s blamed funny!\u201d he thought. \u201cBig cases marked \u2018Mining machinery,\u2019\nbut a couple of stevedores chuck \u2019em into the slings as if they were\nempty. Also cases of merchandise put up like heavy prints that seem just\nas light, and as---- Good Lord! Up there on the bridge! If that ain\u2019t\nBill Morris, I\u2019m dotty. So he\u2019s got a ship out here, eh, after it got\ntoo hot for him about everywhere else on salt water! Lost two ships in\nthe Pacific trade, under mighty suspicious circumstances, and had his\nticket taken away, last I heard of him. Ummh! Ten or twelve years ago,\nthat was. So he\u2019s skipperin\u2019 this craft, eh? If him and me hadn\u2019t locked\nspars two or three times, I\u2019d go over and rile him up with a leetle\nlight, airy banter. I guess he\u2019s----\u201d\n\n\u201cHey you! Got any business here? How\u2019d you get past me at the gate?\u201d a\nvoice disturbed him. And although the fellow spoke bastard Greek, Drake,\nwho, with a sailor\u2019s facility, had picked up considerable of the tongue,\nunderstood, and turned to see the watchman glowering at him.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan\u2019t anybody come onto your dock? Nothing secret\nabout it, is there?\u201d\n\nThe watchman sputtered something about none without a pass from Hakim &\nLetin being allowed in, and somewhat peremptorily ordered Drake to clear\nout. Not being accustomed to such treatment, disgruntled, affronted, but\nrecognizing the weakness of his position and the futility of retort,\nDrake turned and, swearing under his breath, obeyed.\n\nIt is possible that the episode might have passed from his mind\nentirely, but for an encounter that followed some hours later, when,\njust as he was turning toward the _Malabart_, a man whose face bore the\nalmost indelible stamp of the engine rooms of ships, with grease worked\ndeeply into the pores of the skin, respectfully touched his cap peak and\naccosted him in fairly good, though accented, English.\n\n\u201cCaptain Drake,\u201d he said. \u201cExcuse me, sir, for stopping you, but I am a\ngood man out of work, and want a job on your ship, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, my man, but we\u2019re full up,\u201d Captain Eli replied. \u201cToo full,\u201d he\nadded, and would have proceeded on his way, had not the applicant\ninsisted.\n\n\u201cI am good man, sir. First-class engineer; but I would take anything in\nyour engine room. Because me, I have big family, and ships are all full\nnow, it seems to me, sir. I lose job when not my fault. Not at all. When\nI took engines of ship Rhodialim anybody tell you they scrap heap. I\nmake \u2019em good. And now, without word, since that Captain Bill Morris\ncome, I am fired. He say have his own engineer and----\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s that?\u201d Captain Eli, who had been slowly moving forward with\nthe insistent one at his side, stopped and stared at the man. \u201cDo you\nhappen to know the name of the new engineer?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is Simmons, or Simons, or something like that.\u201d\n\nDrake\u2019s mouth pursed itself as if to whistle an exclamation, and for a\nmoment he stood absent-mindedly staring at the stones beneath his feet.\nBut his thought ran: \u201cSimmons! Simmons! That was the engineer of the\nship that Bill lost last, and he was one of the chief witnesses at the\ninsurance investigation. Something funny about this business!\u201d\n\nHe abruptly started away, saying as he did so: \u201cYou come on board with\nme, and I\u2019ll learn if there\u2019s anything can be done. Let me see your\nticket.\u201d And then, a moment later: \u201cBeltramo--Giuseppe Beltramo is your\nname, eh? And your ticket shows a long, clean record. No wonder they\ndidn\u2019t want you on that boat. Never mind the questions, now. I\u2019ll ask\nall the questions myself.\u201d\n\nAs a rule the relations between Captain Eli Drake and his chief mate,\nWilliam Catlin, were of two separate characters, inasmuch as afloat they\nobserved the distinctions in station and Drake brooked no interference;\nbut it was well known that ashore they were more intimate than brothers\nusually are, and confidants in nearly everything. Hence, when the\ncommander sent for Catlin upon his arrival aboard, and on his entry into\nthe cabin addressed him as \u201cBill,\u201d Catlin thought: \u201cSomething\u2019s turned\nup.\u201d Aloud he said:\n\n\u201cLanded something, skipper?\u201d\n\n\u201cLanded enough to set me to a heap of thinking, Bill,\u201d Drake said. And\nthen he bent forward and in a confidential tone told of his experiences,\nending with: \u201cIt seems to me there\u2019s some sort of a job being put up by\nHakim & Letin; and--well, there might be some way for us to make\nsomething out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSort of an opportunity, eh?\u201d Catlin grinned, remembering that the Cape\nCod man had earned the reputation of being an opportunist. \u201cMaybe you\ncan see one, but I can\u2019t. Don\u2019t mind my thick-headedness. I can get\nanything when it\u2019s explained, all right.\u201d\n\nBut Drake seemed to have become absorbed in some thought of his own. He\nstared absently through the cloud of pipe smoke; and finally chuckled,\nas if he had reached a solution of some problem.\n\n\u201cI think I sort of grab an idea,\u201d he said at last, getting to his feet.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hell of a good friend, Bill, but as a helper in working out a\npuzzle you don\u2019t amount to much. Never mind. Think I got it, myself. So\njust talking it over with you did have some use, after all. You go down\nand keep that feller I brought aboard interested, while I slip below and\nsee the chief. Most likely be in his cabin, I expect.\u201d\n\nThey went out together and Drake sought the engineer.\n\n\u201cForbes,\u201d he said to that gray-haired veteran. \u201cCan you find something\nfor an engineer out of a job to do for a few days?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t find enough to do myself, let alone make work for a new man. If\nthis keeps up---- Hold on. While I think of it, that chap Flint, my\nthird, asked me to-day if I thought there was a chance for him in the\nnavy. Now if he got a month off to go to the nearest place he could pass\nhis examinations and file his application----\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sure-enough right thing! Let him take a month, and put this feller\non until Flint comes back. Come on up topside and talk to him.\u201d\n\nThe result of the conversation was that two men, at least, were made\nhappy that evening--Flint, who had got unexpected leave for a month, and\nBeltramo, who had got a temporary billet.\n\nBut Drake was not on the ship when the shift was made. In the roughest\nsuit of clothes he could muster he had gone ashore and made his way to a\nnot too-clean bar, where he knew that pilots were wont to gather. There\nhe patiently waited for the arrival of one he knew. The man came at\nlast, and Captain Eli drew him into a little private room at the rear.\n\n\u201cChristophe,\u201d Captain Eli said, \u201cI have done you a favor once or twice,\nand you\u2019re the kind of man that likes to repay. Well, the time has come\nwhen you may be of use. Now first, you\u2019ve got to keep your mouth\nshut--not one word--not one word to anybody, not even your wife, of what\nwe say here in this room.\u201d\n\nThe pilot, whose face was seamed with years and sea service, promptly\nlifted his hand and swore an oath that would have satisfied any band of\nconspirators that ever existed.\n\n\u201cFirst, you know this sea as well as any one, I take it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy Heaven! Better than all save one or two. Was I not a fisherman in\nthese waters when old enough to float? I know every foot of it and every\nreef, and every island and----\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d Captain Eli interrupted. He leaned across the little table\nbetween them and lowered his voice. \u201cChristophe, if you were going to\nsink a ship that was supposed to be bound eastward--say for Jaffa--where\nwould you do it?\u201d\n\nFor a moment the pilot\u2019s mouth hung open and his eyes were wide, as if\nhe feared for Drake\u2019s sanity.\n\n\u201cBut, sir, captain--you--you are not going to sink---- You don\u2019t mean\nthat----\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, of course not! I sink nothing. But you think it over carefully and\nanswer my questions,\u201d Drake continued. And the pilot, still wondering,\nslowly lowered his eyes, shut them as if to ponder such a case, and then\nasked: \u201cWhat time of year, captain?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time of year,\u201d Drake replied.\n\nAnd again the weather-beaten old pilot shut his eyes and thought.\n\n\u201cListen, sir,\u201d he said in his quaint but adequate English. \u201cMany things\none must think of. If mens want to sink ship, but not drown anybody,\nthey must be not too far from land for open boat, eh? Must be some place\nwhere not too much danger big seas for small boats, eh? Must also be\nsome place where nobody see--away from fishermen\u2019s boats, or cargo\nboats, or bigger ships--some place lonely this time year. Plenty places\nman could scuttle ship, but few where get all these things what want,\neh? Well, about now most fishin\u2019 boats work\u201d--he got up and walked to a\nrough map that was tacked on the wall and that was almost solidly\nsmeared with the trails of many fingers across its surface--\u201cworks up\nabout here mostly. In some months, here; some months, there; but now,\nabout here. So no good up there.\u201d His finger moved as he talked. \u201cNo\ngood through here, because big ships go there. No good there, because\nsmall ships what do island trade work in and out. So, here best place\nfor all things. Almost only place which fit all I speak between here and\nIsland of Rhodes. Not too far out of the way. Very good place. Deep\nwater--plenty water and not much chance boat ever drift when hit bottom.\nYes, captain, sir, that best place anybody can think of--right about\nthere.\u201d\n\nHis gnarled finger ceased to move--pointed at open water off Nauplia.\n\nThey sat down again and, while Christophe eyed him with perplexed looks,\nthe captain reflected.\n\n\u201cThat, you think, is a place a man who knew these waters well would\nselect?\u201d he said. \u201cBut a man who didn\u2019t know them?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod knows where!\u201d the pilot exclaimed, lifting his hands and letting\nthem fall to the table again. \u201cIt is the place--the place I say--where\none who knew would choose in, say--seven times out of ten. As you, sir,\nknow, there are some thousands of islands.\u201d\n\nFor half an hour Drake continued to catechize, but without stirring the\nold pilot from his conclusions.\n\n\u201cWell, Christophe,\u201d he said at last, arising to go, \u201cI\u2019m going to hire\nyou for a cruise that may never take place; but I\u2019m taking a little\ngamble on certain things. You begin work to-morrow, always with your\nmouth shut. Here\u2019s what you are to find out: First, when the Rhodialim\nsails. Second, if she\u2019s taking a pilot aboard, and if so, who and what\nhe is. And third, you\u2019re to report to me aboard the _Malabart_ each\nevening just after dark. I don\u2019t care to have too many notice that you\ncome there. Is it understood? Going wages, of course,\u201d he concluded,\nwith Yankee thrift.\n\n\u201cYes, sir, captain. Very well I understood it, and do what you ask.\nMaybe some time you tell me why all this, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d said Drake laconically, as he thumped upon the table to pay for\nhis bill. And he left behind him one who was still wondering a little if\na certain Captain Drake was all there.\n\nCatlin had a surprise on the following morning, when told that they were\ngoing to take on some supplies. And he was still more astonished when\nDrake asked him to muster the crew and learn whether there was any man\naboard who had ever had any experience in diving. Catlin found a stoker\nwho admitted that years before he had worked for a salvage company.\nDrake told the man to get on shore-going clothes and come with him, and\nthe twain disappeared. The man returned that afternoon accompanied by a\ntruck, which duly unloaded and brought aboard a collection of stuff that\nmade even Catlin scratch his head, and caused conjectures for\u2019ard as to\nwhether The Old Hyena was going into the wrecking business. It consisted\nof a complete diving outfit--air pumps and all--as well as huge\ncollision mats and handling gear. Drake did not appear until evening,\nand seemed unusually speechless, and he dined and waited for Christophe.\n\nThe latter came at last, grinning with self-satisfaction, and was at\nonce closeted with Drake, who asked: \u201cWell, what did you learn?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Rhodialim, she sail day after to-morrow. She got most her cargo\naboard now. But it\u2019s funny, captain, sir, she got one man who knew this\nsea same as me. Long time ago he fisherman, then go away, and been down\nSmyrna where not got too good name. Good man, when sober, but too much\ndrink, so never get good job. That man I see in saloon. He most full\nand---- You owe me thirty drachmas, I spend on him get him fuller, so he\ntalk. Bymeby he borrow fifty drachmas from me, which also you owes me.\nHe brag some and say pretty soon he pay back. Pretty soon, maybe two\nweeks, he come back with plenty money in pockets. But he shut up like\noyster when I ask how make this so much money, and he say nobody but him\never goin\u2019 know that. Now what you wish me make?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go home and keep on keeping your mouth shut. Come aboard at noon\nto-morrow. We sail to-morrow afternoon.\u201d Drake was suddenly decided in\nhis movements.\n\n\u201cHow long be gone from my old woman?\u201d Christophe asked.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell. Maybe one week, maybe two. Not likely to be longer, I\nthink. But all you\u2019ve got to do is to come aboard and I\u2019ll tell you then\nwhere we\u2019re bound. I\u2019m going to clear for Smyrna. There will be no\nsecret about that.\u201d\n\nOn the following morning when Captain Eli went ashore he took with him\nthe chief engineer. The latter returned with two big machine cases and\narmored, high-pressure hose, together with a case of fittings. Late that\nafternoon the _Malabart_ slipped out and away, so palpably light that\nother sea captains who observed her shook their heads with\nunderstanding. A ship putting to sea in ballast in dull times evokes the\nsympathy of the seawise. Aboard the _Malabart_ there was an air of gloom\namong the crew.\n\nThe captain and owner, walking the bridge, said to Catlin:\n\n\u201cWell, Bill, I\u2019m taking a gamble--thousand to one shot, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nWhen dusk fell the island of Thermia lay close in to starboard, and the\nman at the wheel stood ready to port his helm and bring her over from\nthe sou\u2019-east-by-east to an easterly course to round the island, that\nbeing the route toward Smyrna; but old Christophe, standing behind him,\ntook the wheel, rang for slow speed and groped in toward the island. It\nloomed up about them, a rocky point, before he said over his shoulder to\nCaptain Eli:\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s where we can lay to, sir. Good anchorage here in this cove, and\nno risk of wind.\u201d\n\nAll that night she rocked there, gently; on a sea that was almost\nwithout a swell. And when morning came, to the crew\u2019s further curiosity,\nshe brought in her hook, swung about, and headed due west, plodding\nalong at slow speed and apparently purposeless. A liner came out of the\nnorth and gave her a passing hoot. Christophe, eyeing the other boat,\nsaid to Captain Eli:\n\n\u201cShe be for Messina way, and now not likely be another ship along here\nfor ten days. That\u2019s what those mens know. If I make good guess, that\u2019s\nwhy they clear Pir\u00e6us to-day, after big ship go, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when will we make that Island of Hydra?\u201d Drake asked, staring to\nthe westward.\n\n\u201cJust about sunset, captain, sir. Then we slip round it and there are\nsmall islands between it and mainland, and entrance into Nauplia which\nso long and so big it is like long gulf. We lay behind them islands,\nsir, and--see what shall see about midnight, I think, sir.\u201d\n\nDrake caught his dry, knowing grin, but did not entirely share his\nconfidence as to the outcome of their strange voyage.\n\nThe pilot\u2019s prediction as to progress was fulfilled; just as a hazy\nsunset colored the tips of the high, bleak mountains behind which the\nday disappeared, they passed the isle with its abandoned and obsolete\nfortifications, and hove to in waters that seemed to have been deserted\nsince the time of ancient wars. Night fell with a thin, low-lying fog\nthat seemed to sweep down from the great bastions of Nauplia and rest on\nthe still waters. The stars were obscured and a new depression engulfed\nDrake.\n\n\u201cThe weather\u2019s against us,\u201d he said gloomily, to the storm-beaten old\npilot. \u201cThey could pass us at a couple of cable lengths and we\u2019d never\nknow it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if we were out in a small boat, listening,\u201d Christophe said. \u201cIn\nsmall boat hear everything. On ship, no--not so quite well. We must put\nout boat and get out maybe two three miles and wait. Yes, maybe fog too\nbad, one way, but very good, other. When they pass we get course then\nslip quiet, very quiet, same way, with _Malabart_, eh?\u201d\n\nDrake pondered. There seemed no other method. He cursed the fog, but\nordered a boat away with Catlin and the pilot aboard, the latter\nassuring him that he could find his way back to the ship if the night\nwere as black as the pits of Satan. A long wait followed after the boat\nhad disappeared. The gloom of the darkened _Malabart_, the lack of the\nbell striking the hour, the absolute stillness of the ship, were all\nupsetting. The very lifelessness of the protected water where she lay\nwas annoying, for there was not the slightest lapping whisper of a wave\nagainst her hull. Down in the engine room even the stokers who kept up\nsteam had been cautioned against the clanging of a furnace door or the\nring of a shovel. Had one passed the _Malabart_ within ten yards he\nmight have thought her the ghost of some long-abandoned ship. Drake\nlistened from the outer wing of the bridge, bending over, sometimes with\na hand cupped to his ear, until he was tired. He had about decided that\nhis voyage and expenditure had been born of folly, when he heard a faint\ncreak, followed a minute later by another. Then Catlin\u2019s voice below\nhailed softly, and the boat pulled around to the side ladder, which had\nbeen lowered and swung barely above the water.\n\n\u201cAll right, sir. She passed so close that she almost ran us down. She\nhad doused her lights and was not doing more than five or six knots.\nChristophe says there could be no mistake. She was the Rhodialim, all\nright.\u201d\n\nThe pilot joined in with: \u201cAbout a mile and a half out. Long row back.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t do for us to follow too closely on their heels, anyway,\u201d\nCaptain Eli said. \u201cBut are you certain that you can pick her up again,\nChristophe, in all this murk?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the course she will take. I think so, with luck,\u201d the pilot\nsaid. \u201cThey not alter course again. Too much else business think of, I\nexpect. Just keep straight on about five, six miles; then stop. They not\nwant go much farther. Might meet small fishin\u2019 boats out of Nauplia. Not\ntake chance of that, eh?\u201d\n\nCaptain Eli stood blockily, a dim figure in the darkness, and seemed\nmaking mental calculations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d best be in too much of a hurry,\u201d he said at last.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to take the chances of being too late. If the crew are in on\nit with the commander, mate and engineer, there\u2019ll be no time wasted. If\nthey\u2019re not, the boats won\u2019t be ready to lower, and besides he\u2019ll have\nto put up a bluff at saving the ship, to fool the crew. We\u2019d best give\nthem at least an hour and a half.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat crew, captain, sir, are the scum of the water front,\u201d Christophe\nput in.\n\n\u201cBut just the same, we don\u2019t know that they\u2019re in on it,\u201d Drake replied.\n\u201cBill Morris don\u2019t like to cut too many in on his crooked work. Seems to\nme more likely that he\u2019ll try to stampede \u2019em into the boats after\nputting up a great show to save the ship. He\u2019ll call on his engineer for\nsteam and announce that they must beach her. The engineer will either\npretend to start the engines, or swear that he can\u2019t turn \u2019em over. That\nwould stampede the crew, if they\u2019re the sort one picks up in these\nparts. I think we\u2019ve got to risk it, and give \u2019em an hour and a half,\ncertain. After that it depends on how quickly we can pick her up.\nBeltramo tells me that she\u2019s fitted with two sea cocks only into her\nmain hold, because her engines are set well aft. So she\u2019s not likely to\nfill within some hours after they\u2019re opened, and I\u2019ve got it doped out\nfrom what I know of Morris\u2019 work that\u2019s the way he\u2019ll put her under, if\nthat\u2019s what he intends to do; but it\u2019s only little things that are queer\nwhich makes me think that\u2019s what he\u2019s up to. Big gamble, but----\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be. If not, why he not go on to east\u2019ard?\u201d the pilot asked. \u201cI\u2019m\nsure of it, captain, sir.\u201d\n\nBut Drake was still doubtful when, still in blackness and running at\nslow speed, the _Malabart_ nosed out into the sea with the pilot himself\nat the wheel and keeping an eye on both time and compass as he took up\nthe trail. To the commander\u2019s ears it seemed that with the ship so light\nthat her blades were barely under water the thrash of the slow-turning\nscrew must be audible for miles. He saw the wheel slowly revolving under\nChristophe\u2019s hands and sensed that the pilot was now where he thought\nthey might find the sinking ship.\n\nCaptain Eli knew that both Catlin, and the second mate, Giles, and\nnearly all the crew were forward peering into the dimness ahead, but it\nseemed impossible to see anything on such a night. It was a matter of\nluck, and he felt a dawning apprehension that his luck was out. Watching\nthe compass over the pilot\u2019s shoulder he saw that the ship had made one\ncomplete circle and was now holding dead ahead. The wheel again whirled,\nand they began another circle, a mile deeper in that huge bay surrounded\nby high and forbidding mountains, when there came a soft whistle from\nforward and a pattering of bare feet. Catlin\u2019s muffled voice came from\nbelow:\n\n\u201cHold her, sir, hold her. I think we\u2019ve sighted the Rhodialim about two\npoints off the port quarter.\u201d\n\nDrake jumped to the engine tube--it having been arranged that a man was\nto stand by to obviate the use of bells, inasmuch as the sound of an\nengine bell might carry far in such stillness--and now the _Malabart_\nlost way and came to a stop. The boat, which was swinging barely above\nthe water, was lowered, and Drake, Catlin, and two men tumbled in and\nfell to the oars. They rowed quietly.\n\n\u201cThere she is, sir,\u201d Catlin whispered.\n\nExercising still more caution, they drew down on the dim shape that lay\ninert and heavy on the water. They came alongside and listened for\nvoices, but caught no sound. They found the boat davits hanging idly\nover the water, and went up the falls noiselessly, and stood on the\ndeck. Together they ran here and there, making a search for any human\nbeing. Not until then were they confident that she had been abandoned.\nListening down the main cargo hatch they could hear the swirling and\ngurgling of water and the soft bumping of empty cases and crates.\n\n\u201cGet back to the ship, Bill, and rush across all the men that can be\nspared; so that if that gang are standing by waiting for the Rhodialim\nto sink, we can knock \u2019em overboard. Tell Christophe to bring the\n_Malabart_ alongside twenty minutes after you\u2019ve gone. That\u2019ll give you\ntime to be back here ahead of her; so if we have to repel boarders,\nwe\u2019ll have the men to do it. Be as quiet as you can and get a move on.\u201d\n\nCatlin slipped away and over the side like a ghost. After he had gone\nDrake listened attentively for a few minutes, then went back and again\nbent over the open hatch. Afterward he tried, by leaning far over the\nrail, to estimate how deeply the scuttled ship had already sunk. It\nseemed to him that she couldn\u2019t last very much longer. Taking an\nelectric torch from his pocket, he went below. She was a fairly deep\nship, of good draft, and he was pleased to observe that the cabin floors\nwere not yet damp. He decided that if the sea cocks were of the diameter\ngiven by Giuseppe, the former engineer, she had at least an hour and a\nhalf longer to float. He knew that her fires must have been drawn,\nbecause Morris would not run the risk of the sound of a boiler explosion\ndrawing attention to the spot, if there chanced to be any boat within\nhearing.\n\n\u201cHe knows this business of scuttling ships better than any one I ever\nheard of,\u201d Drake soliloquized. \u201cBut if he cleared off this time, without\nwaiting to see her under, he made one hell of a mistake.\u201d\n\nHe looked at his watch in the light of his torch and meditated: \u201cIf Bill\nmoves lively and doesn\u2019t lose his way, he should be back here in half an\nhour from now. If he loses his way in this blamed fog--I\u2019m afraid we cut\nit pretty short!\u201d\n\nHe climbed back to the deck, went to the port side, from which the boat\nhad put off, and listened, prepared to answer a hail, if Catlin returned\ngroping and had to shout to learn his bearings. Then from the opposite\nside of the ship, he heard a single telltale thump, as if an oar in\nclumsy hands had slipped from an oarlock and brought up with a bang.\n\nDrake ran across to the starboard rail just in time to hear a muttered\nimprecation, in colloquial Greek:\n\n\u201cQuiet there, you lubber! If the skipper and those two pets of his are\nhanging around, we\u2019ve a fine chance of getting away with anything.\u201d\n\nDrake pursed his lips into a silent whistle, and through his mind ran\nthe thought: \u201cIt\u2019s the crew of this craft come back. Probably suspected\nsomething and are trying somehow to double-cross Morris, Simmons and\nwhoever they\u2019ve let in on it with \u2019em. I\u2019m a fool. Should have kept at\nleast one man with me for such an emergency.\u201d\n\nQuick as was his thought, his action was quicker. He jerked off his\nboots and threw off his jacket. He ran aft in the direction that he was\ncertain the boat must take to board, and leaned over the rail just as a\nman started to climb upward.\n\n\u201cGet back into that boat and sheer off,\u201d he called down. \u201cThis ship is\nabandoned and is salvage.\u201d\n\nThe man hesitated, and a voice from below ordered:\n\n\u201cGo on up! We\u2019ll talk this over on deck.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike hell you will!\u201d Captain Eli declared. \u201cAnd if any man tries to\ncome on this ship, he\u2019s looking for trouble. Sheer off, if you want a\ntalk. If you want a fight, come ahead.\u201d\n\nThe man holding the boat fall climbed up and got a foothold on the\nstrake. He threw a hand inward and caught a rail stanchion and swung\nupward, encouraged by muttered comments.\n\n\u201cAll right! If you will have it----\u201d Drake growled.\n\nAnd leaned far over, and struck. In the gloom and darkness he had not\nstruck well, and instead of knocking his man overboard into the boat\nbelow, he merely shifted him outward just beyond reach of a second blow.\nDrake threw himself over the rail and hanging by one hand struck again\nwith the other. It was a body blow, but the man was tenacious, clung to\nthe rope, swayed like a pendulum, and, as he swung back, kicked at Drake\nwith his heavy sea boot. But this time Drake\u2019s fist smashed home, and\nthe boarder grunted, loosened his grip on the boat fall, and went\nslithering down among his companions. Drake climbed back over the rail\njust in time to feel a stunning smash on the back of his head, and was\nnot until then aware that while he had engaged one assailant, another\nhad climbed up the opposite boat fall with a monkey-like agility, and\nhad come behind him.\n\nInfuriated by the attack, he whirled, seized the man, lifted him as if\nhe were a bundle of waste, and, with a giant\u2019s heave, threw him far\noutward. The man shouted as he fell, but Drake did not hear the splash;\nfor now he found himself fighting desperately with two other dark shapes\nwho charged silently. Even as Drake fought, he recalled what he had\noverheard, which convinced him that these men also had no wish to recall\nMorris and his fellow conspirators. Drake grinned at the humor of that\nsituation--a scalawag crew trying to steal aboard the ship they had\nabandoned, Morris and his fellows somewhere out there in the dark,\nhimself battling for the salvage like a dog for a bone, and all the\ntime, down there in the hold, the sea cocks flooding the sinking ship.\n\nThe number of his assailants increased. They were urged on by the leader\nin a hoarse mutter:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s alone. He must be alone, because no one else comes. Down him! Down\nhim, because he\u2019s probably got a boat coming!\u201d\n\nDrake fought desperately. Two of his assailants went to the deck and lay\nthere struggling, as they tried to recover their senses. Veteran fighter\nthat he was, the participator in events which had earned for him the\nsobriquet of The Old Hyena, he used his head coolly, his fists heavily,\nand as he moved here and there slipped out of the dangers of being\ncornered and fought for time.\n\nThen came the accident. Retreating, his heels caught over a coil of rope\nthat had been carelessly left on the deck. He struggled vainly to\nrecover his balance, but they were on him like a pack of wolves. And in\na fighting, struggling group came to the deck, where they twisted and\nturned as he tried to regain his feet, was pulled down, tried again, was\nstruck heavily over his eyes, saw stars, shook his head like an enraged\nbull, and felt himself pinioned to the deck while one of the men he had\npreviously knocked down arrived in time to kick him in the ribs. He was\nnow roaring with fury, heedless of all alarms and thinking of nothing\nbut revenge.\n\nHe did not hear the angry shout of Catlin and his men coming on deck.\nThe hold on him suddenly relaxed. He sat up, rubbing his bruised side\nand clearing the blood from his eyes, heard Bill Catlin\u2019s fighting oaths\nand got to his feet. Both forward and aft shadowy forms of men in flight\nflitted across the decks. He heard Catlin\u2019s shout:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let \u2019em get back to their boat! Knock \u2019em out and hold \u2019em.\nThey\u2019ve probably killed the skipper. If Drake is dead, we\u2019ll drown the\nwhole damn lot!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, don\u2019t let \u2019em get away, Bill,\u201d Drake shouted, climbing to his feet\nand regaining his full senses. \u201cI want \u2019em. Particularly that fleabitten\nrat who gave me the boots. Lash \u2019em up and get \u2019em together. Quick! The\nship may sink under us at any time.\u201d\n\nBoth he and Catlin ran here and there to bring matters to a conclusion,\nand within a few minutes there were seven somewhat bruised and battered\nruffians thrown into the nearest cabins and, despite their protestations\nand appeals, locked in. Their leader, who time and again shouted that he\nwas the second mate of the Rhodialim, was the first to whine for mercy.\nHe cried, in comprehensible English:\n\n\u201cYou hell of an Ingleeshmans tie us up and put us here to drown. You let\nus go we make no more of the fights. We go quiet. But capitano, please,\nsir, not drown us.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrown nothing!\u201d Drake growled. \u201cIf we see that we can\u2019t save the ship,\nwe\u2019ll bring you up and turn you loose in your boat, you damn pirates!\nAnd listen here! You keep quiet now. We\u2019ve got no more time to waste on\nyou.\u201d He turned to Catlin and said: \u201cLock \u2019em in. We\u2019ve got to fall to,\nif we want to keep this craft afloat.\u201d\n\nThey hastily ran out to the deck just in time to hear Giles, the second\nmate, calling:\n\n\u201cShip\u2019s coming, sir. Shall I flash a light for \u2019em, or hail?\u201d\n\nDrake himself cupped his hands and called: \u201c_Malabart_, ahoy! This way!\u201d\nWhen he got a response, he ran back to where he had fallen, struck a\nmatch, found his electric torch that had fallen from his pocket, and\nwith it as a beacon, directed the _Malabart_ to come alongside.\n\nHe called for Beltramo to come aboard to point out the location of the\nsea cocks, and for the collision mats to be put across. He set lookouts\nto guard against the possibility of other boarders, and himself took a\nhand at the work.\n\n\u201cIf the others haven\u2019t heard the row, it\u2019s not likely they\u2019ll come\nback,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll take no chances; we\u2019ll keep as quiet as\npossible, just to avoid any more risks of interference. Move lively\nnow!\u201d\n\nThe men of the _Malabart_ ran here and there, their bare feet pattering,\nand pulled and hauled a huge, unwieldy mat to the outward side. Then\nthey ran its looped lines forward and under the ship\u2019s hull. The\n_Malabart_ sheered off to give play, and the men fell to the lines,\nheaving and tugging, as the mat went over the side and submerged itself\nat the point indicated by Beltramo. Throughout their work, running, and\npulling, and hauling, that same air of noiselessness, of low-spoken\norders, was maintained. In the same muffled silence, filled only with\nsounds of movement, the other mat was fixed on the starboard side and\ndrawn taut, and the officers, listening intently down the hatchway, were\nencouraged when the sounds of swirling and gurgling were no longer\naudible.\n\nA huge cable was brought across from the _Malabart_, fixed through the\nfor\u2019ard bits. The _Malabart\u2019s_ screw turned, and she slowly moved ahead\nuntil she took the strain of the tow and headed back for the shelter of\nthe islands where she had lain in wait. Down on the engine-room steps\nCaptain Eli held his torchlight against a water mark and slowly his face\nlost its grimness. His eyes twinkled when he saw the ship was no longer\ntaking in an appreciable or dangerous quantity of water. He mentally\nestimated the time, and muttered: \u201cWe\u2019ll make it, sure, unless she\nsprings another leak, or the mats fail!\u201d\n\nNeither accident came, and in the dawn the _Malabart_ towed her salvage\ninto the sheltered waters, slacked off and came alongside as the\nRhodialim\u2019s anchors splashed into the sea. Drake, going across to his\nown ship, where the cook was serving out hot mugs of coffee, gulped one,\nand eyed the remnants of the two packing cases that Forbes had opened on\nthe _Malabart\u2019s_ deck. Two centrifugal pumps, stocky and powerful,\nsquatted there in the midst of the confusion, and the engineer was\ndirecting the fitting of the steam lines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll lash the ships alongside. It\u2019s safe, I think, and it\u2019s so still\nin these waters they\u2019ll not chafe,\u201d Drake said to Catlin and the\nengineer. And that maneuver was quickly effected. The pump suckers were\nhauled across and splashed into the half-drowned hull of the salvaged\nship and a few minutes later two great streams of water were pouring\nsteadily into the sea. When daylight came the diving apparatus was\nplanted on the Rhodialim\u2019s deck, and, guided by a water torch, the man\nwho had abandoned diving made a descent, found the sea cocks and closed\nthem. And now the salvage was practically assured.\n\nIt was nearly noon when Drake said to Catlin:\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ll go below and get at the bottom of this business. We\u2019ll have a\nlittle chat with that second mate we\u2019ve got trussed up.\u201d\n\nThey brought the man up to the deck. He was sullen, cowed, and palpably\nfrightened. Drake regarded him coldly for a full minute, frowning before\nhe said:\n\n\u201cWe brought you up to get at the truth of this. Why did you come back to\nthe ship? Did Morris send you?\u201d\n\nThe man started to evade, to stammer, to make palpably false statements\nuntil Drake threatened with:\n\n\u201cStow that guff! The only chance you\u2019ve got is to come across with a\nclean yarn. If you do that, you\u2019ll get away clean. Now quit your waving\nthe hook, or back below you go, until I can hand you over to the shore\npolice in Pir\u00e6us. If it suits you better to talk Greek---- Christophe,\ncome here and tell me what this man says. I want to get it straight.\u201d\n\nChristophe came, added his own urgings to overcome the man\u2019s reluctance,\nand then listened with a dry grin to a voluble confession. Now and then\nhe interrupted with a question, and although Drake understood the gist\nof the mate\u2019s words, Christophe finally turned and in his own way told\nwhat he had learned.\n\n\u201cThees man, he think maybe he and these other mens can maybe get lots of\nlittle things like chronometers and glasses and such what left behind;\nso after lost Captain Morris boat in fog, they row back see if she still\nafloat, and come aboard. He swear he not know anything about how she\nsink on purpose. Engineer what Morris frien\u2019 run on deck, yell she\nsprung big leak, and Morris make fuss, and then say no hope and mus\u2019\ntake to boats. When these man come aboard and find you, they thinks\nmaybe ship not sink after all, and if they can get her back they make\nlot of money for save her. So, fight like hell. He swear that all he\nknow. Maybe he spik truth, I think so.\u201d\n\nDrake stared at the man for a moment. Then, with apparent irrelevance,\nhe asked Christophe:\n\n\u201cHow do people go by land from Nauplia to Pir\u00e6us, and how long does it\ntake?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoad over the mountains, sir. Easy go. But take maybe two, three days.\u201d\n\n\u201cTelephone, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, captain, sir. Nauplia fine city. One time capital of Greece\nand----\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! You tell this man we\u2019re going to keep \u2019em aboard the _Malabart_\nuntil we get ready to make it to Pir\u00e6us, and that nothing will happen to\nthem, unless they try to leave before we get ready for them to go.\u201d\n\nThe mate of the Rhodialim understood, and broke into profuse promises;\nbut to make certain that they could not escape, Drake had all the boats\nof the _Malabart_ brought around to the salvaged ship, moored, and the\noars taken away, before he liberated his battered prisoners and told the\ncook to feed them.\n\nCatlin was still wondering what Drake had in mind when, a few days\nlater, the Rhodialim was ready to put to sea under her own steam. Then\nDrake said to his mate:\n\n\u201cMr. Catlin, you take Beltramo and whatever scratch crew you need for\nthe engine room and ship, and go aboard the Rhodialim and follow us to\nPir\u00e6us; but first have the boat that scum came in brought around, chuck\nin grub and water enough to take them to Nauplia, then chuck them in\nafter it and tell \u2019em to go and be damned to \u2019em.\u201d\n\nThe mate\u2019s wonder ceased on the day when the two ships came to the\ncrowded docks of the Greek seaport, amid the babbling exclamations of\nthose who recognized the salvaged ship. Drake called to Catlin to\naccompany him, and they walked from the docks to make their official\nreports.\n\n\u201cWe ought to get a neat bit of salvage money out of this trip,\u201d Catlin\nsaid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get that all right. And I\u2019m going to cut it up--half of it,\nanyhow, among every man that was with us. Christophe ought to get a good\nchunk, and so should Beltramo.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what I can\u2019t get is why you held that gang of beach combers until\nwe were ready to come here,\u201d Catlin said, observing that The Old Hyena\nwas in high good humor.\n\n\u201cI waited to give Bill Morris and his pals time to get back and swear to\ntheir story of how the ship was lost,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time they,\nas well as Hakim & Letin, were put out of business.\u201d\n\n\n",
