    "body": "Never within the memory of the oldest _voyageur_ had there been such a\nsnowfall in the Trois Lacs country. During the latter part of December\nand all through January the gray clouds hung low over the tree-tops,\npouring down their load of fine crystals with sullen persistency, while\nthe north wind, sweeping through the forest, piled the flying flakes\nhigh against all obstacles, driving them firmly into each crack and\ncrevice.\n\nThe two trappers on Ca\u00f1on Creek fought the drifts for many days in an\neffort to keep their lines clear. At last, however, when they woke one\nfearfully cold morning to find not only the north window but also the\ndoorway on the other side of the little cabin covered with hard-packed\ndrifts that rose clear to the peak of the squat roof, they laid aside\ntheir spruce-wood shovels with a sigh of resignation and relief.\n\nJim Henderson, gnarled and grizzled by years of life in the wilderness,\ndug a narrow tunnel to daylight. While he went to the creek and chopped\nthe water-hole clear of ice, his partner, a young tenderfoot named Nick\nHartley, cleared the snow from the wood-pile and sent a good number of\ndry logs down the slanting chute into the cabin. The men then made a\nfinal round of the traps and lifted those not already frozen and too\ndeeply buried. Thereafter the daily trip for water and more infrequent\nattacks on the wood-pile were the only breaks in the dull routine of\neating and sleeping.\n\nDuring the first few days the partners loafed about, enjoying to the\nfull the perfect relaxation that comes with the knowledge that work is\nfor the time being not only futile but practically impossible.\n\nTime passed slowly, however, and gradually the atmosphere of content\nbegan to change to one of restlessness. Nick, who had never before been\nsnowed up, was the first to feel the irritability that generally\naccompanies a long period of enforced inactivity. One morning as he\ncrept down the tunnel behind a pile of firewood he said--\n\n\u201cSeems to me you picked a punk place to build this cabin--right under a\nbank and only open on the south, where any fool ought to know a north\nwind\u2019d drift worst.\u201d\n\nHenderson knew very well that he had made a mistake in picking the spot,\nbut he did not care to have the fact called to his attention.\n\n\u201cOh, I did, did I?\u201d he flared in sudden heat. \u201cWell, it\u2019s comf\u2019table,\nain\u2019t it? I ain\u2019t noticed you packin\u2019 up yet. Durned glad to come in\nhere, you was, last Fall. If you don\u2019t like it you know what you can\ndo--an\u2019 where you can go, too!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho said anything about not likin\u2019 it? I didn\u2019t. You know you foozled\nit when you located here, or you wouldn\u2019t holler like that before you\u2019re\nhurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d blustered the old man.\n\n\u201cYou make me plum tired. If you had any backbone at all, you\u2019d have kept\nyour mouth shut in the first place, an\u2019 not started whinin\u2019 like a kid.\u201d\n\nNick suppressed a surge of wrath and turned away, lest he rouse his\npartner\u2019s temper any further. He did not know that this was Henderson\u2019s\nmethod of weathering a long snowstorm--a hot argument every now and then\nto act as a sort of safety valve, relieving the pressure of the bile of\nboredom before it had accumulated to a dangerous degree.\n\nHenderson made a few more attempts to rouse the younger man, but when he\ndiscovered that he could not do it, he too grew silent and increasingly\nangry. He resented Nick\u2019s attitude, and Nick was quick to note the fact,\nand to feel a like resentment not unmixed with apprehension as\nHenderson, his pride forbidding him any longer to rage openly, took more\nand more to muttering and cursing under his breath.\n\nNick worried gloomily over the change in his partner, not realizing that\na day or so of work on the trap-lines, and a few more pelts added to the\npile in the corner, would serve to bring both men back to normal\ncheerfulness. He sulked and moped, and watched Henderson with hostile\neyes.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch a state of affairs could not continue for long. A belated thaw had\nat last set in. The snow was ceasing, and a few more days would see a\nresumption of outdoor work, when a final flare-up occurred. It was late\nafternoon. Henderson rolled out of his bunk to go to the creek for water\nand found Hartley gazing at the snow-bound north window. The old man\nlaughed, a sneering, mirthless cackle.\n\n\u201cEnjoyin\u2019 the view?\u201d he asked.\n\nNick had been thinking of digging away enough to let some light into the\ncabin, now that the snow had stopped drifting, but after that remark he\nwould willingly have died first. He grew red and tried not to notice the\nquestion.\n\n\u201cWell, now,\u201d went on Henderson, enjoying the situation, \u201cI always liked\nthat view myself. It\u2019s so much better \u2019n gazin\u2019 at your sour-bellied\nfeatures.\u201d\n\nHe picked up a pail and his snowshoes and added with elaborate\npoliteness:\n\n\u201cPossibly you could tear yourself away long enough to git some wood?\nThere ain\u2019t any left, as you\u2019ll see if you can wrench your eyes away\nfrom that soul-fillin\u2019 picture of Nature at her best.\u201d\n\nThis was a long and difficult speech for Henderson, and he felt that he\nhad done a rather neat bit of work in getting it off so smoothly. He\nchuckled again as he opened the door and started up the tunnel.\n\nWhen he heard that laugh, something snapped in Nick\u2019s brain. He whirled\nin a frenzy and rushed to the door.\n\n\u201cBy ---- I\u2019ve stood all I\u2019m goin\u2019 to from you!\u201d he cried wildly. \u201cYou\nkeep out of here or I\u2019ll beat the livin\u2019 lights out o\u2019 you.\u201d\n\nHis voice rose to a shriek as he poured out his rage in a flood of\nvituperation. Henderson, standing at the top of the tunnel, went flaming\nhot with a fierce joy.\n\n\u201cCome out here an\u2019 say that!\u201d he yelled. \u201cCome out, ---- you!\u201d\n\nAt that moment Nick, frantically eager to obey the summons, dived into\nthe tunnel. His head and shoulders struck its roof. A slight upward\nsurge as he plunged, and the snow slumped in with a dull rumble. Nick\nwas swept back into the cabin by a miniature avalanche, and Henderson\nstood staring at the tumbled groove where the tunnel had been.\n\nIn the next few instants the old man\u2019s opinion of Nick underwent a\nradical change. His exhilarating wrath became red fury, born of the\nconviction that his partner was a coward--who had played a sneaking but\neffective trick that left Henderson ridiculously helpless. As this\nrealization swept over him he grew dizzy and swayed on his feet, while\nthe veins stood out on his purple neck. When he could control his limbs\nhe floundered to the chimney and began to roar inarticulate masses of\nblasphemy at the man below. At last he managed to form a coherent\nsentence.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d he bellowed, sobbing. \u201cGreat ---- just wait \u2019til I get you! If I\ndon\u2019t rid the earth o\u2019 your ---- drivelin\u2019 carcass. Coward! ----\u2019s too\ngood for the likes o\u2019 you! Hangin\u2019s too good! Shootin\u2019s too-- Oh, gimme\nmy gun! I\u2019ll shoot you down like a yeller dog! I\u2019ll drill you like a\nsieve! Just wait!\u201d\n\nHe surged back to the tunnel as the smoke from the fire strangled him\nand, snatching up a snowshoe, began to dig furiously.\n\nNick, listening to this tirade of abuse, began to feel a panicky terror.\nHenderson\u2019s gasping, choking voice sounded perfectly demoniacal as it\nreverberated in the chimney, and the frightful threats were delivered\nwith the frenzy of a raving maniac.\n\nThe long siege had been too much, thought Nick. The old man had gone\nsuddenly crazy--crazy with the lust for blood. Weren\u2019t the papers always\nfull of stories of men who shot people in bursts of insanity and then\ngrew sane again? If Henderson could get his gun now, he would surely do\nfor him, unless he shot Henderson first-- or unless--but he didn\u2019t want\nto run. He must do something, though!\n\nHis partner\u2019s snowshoe was crunching nearer and nearer the snow-filled\ndoorway, while the digger gasped great lungfuls of air into his heaving\nchest. Nick stood hesitating for another moment, glancing about the\ndim-lit room while the candle on the mantel spluttered and wavered. Then\nhe ran to the shelf by the bunks and with trembling hands gathered up\nthe two revolvers, the rifle and all the cartridges.\n\nThree minutes later Henderson burst in. Nick stood waiting for him with\nset face in front of the fire-place. The old man kicked the little pile\nof snow to one side and shut the door carefully. Then he whirled and\ncharged across the cabin. His partner met him half-way.\n\nThe desperate rough-and-tumble fight that followed raged for an hour,\nall about the little room, under the bunks, almost in the fire. Stools\nflew everywhere, extra clothing fell from the walls and got tangled up\nwith the writhing swelter of arms and legs, ashes swirled, while the men\npanted and tugged, punched gasping, short-armed punches, neither giving\nan inch, seemingly as strong and fresh as ever.\n\nThen of a sudden as they rose together Nick made a terrific effort to\nhit the old man on the jaw. The old man dodged back sharply and the fist\nswished harmlessly past. Nick half-turned and stumbled forward, unable\nto overcome the momentum of the blow. He blundered heavily against\nHenderson, who had not regained his balance. They crashed to the floor,\nrolled apart, and lay flat in utter exhaustion.\n\nHenderson at length drew himself with much grunting to a sitting\nposture. He sighed as his eyes took in the wreckage of the room.\n\n\u201cWhat a couple o\u2019 durn fools we be, anyway,\u201d he remarked heavily.\n\nNick rolled over and met his partner\u2019s wry grin with a hoarse chuckle.\nHe too sighed as he surveyed the hodge-podge of furniture and clothes\nsprinkled with ashes. The old man staggered to his feet and made for the\ndoor to let some fresh air into the reeking room. As he stepped over\nHartley he stopped and reached down a sweaty hand.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 I figgered you was a coward,\u201d he remarked. \u201cMan, you\u2019re a wild\ncat!\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, heck,\u201d said Nick as he grasped the hand and pulled himself erect,\n\u201cyou\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 done me up easy, if you hadn\u2019t been all in from diggin\u2019. An\u2019\nsay, Jim,\u201d he snickered again--\u201cI thought you\u2019d gone crazy! Honest I\ndid. I was that scared I--\u201d\n\nHenderson had reached out to unlatch the door when the wooden handle\nlifted seemingly of its own volition. The heavy door swung inward with a\nrush, and three men leaped into the shack.\n\n\u201cPut \u2019em up!\u201d said the leader, greasy-looking and fat.\n\n\u201cWhat--\u201d began Henderson in utter bewilderment.\n\nThen he caught the gleam of an automatic, and his hands rose reluctantly\nabove his head. Nick, after a suddenly suppressed motion toward the\nshelf, followed suit dumbly.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe other invaders came forward, each with a snowshoe thong formed into\na noose. They deftly slipped these over the upstretched hands, drew them\ntight with a jerk and tied them.\n\n\u201cNow, then, hands down--way down,\u201d went on the fat man.\n\nThe thongs\u2019 free ends were tied with painstaking care to their wearers\u2019\nankles.\n\n\u201cBring \u2019em over here where we can look at \u2019em.\u201d\n\nThe fat man walked to the hearth. The prisoners were pushed after him.\n\n\u201cSee here,\u201d said Henderson, as his tall, dark jailer finished searching\nhim and started a thorough investigation of the cabin. \u201cWhat\u2019s the\nmeanin\u2019 o\u2019 this, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d responded the fat man in a confidential tone, \u201cwe\u2019re hungry, see?\nSo we decided to ask ourselves to dinner with you and your buddy.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s guardian came back from his inspection of the premises.\n\n\u201cSay, Cap,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of food, all right, but there ain\u2019t\nno guns here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you looked everywhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, an\u2019 so\u2019s Tony. Why was you so leery o\u2019 jumpin\u2019 these holds?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019d ye jump \u2019em for anyway?\u201d grumbled Tony.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll answer both them questions while we rest a bit,\u201d said the fat man\nindulgently. \u201cAs to jumpin\u2019 \u2019em when they\u2019re fightin\u2019, Perry, you never\nwant to do that. It\u2019s takin\u2019 a chance, because there\u2019s generly a gun\nthat both\u2019s tryin\u2019 to grab, an\u2019 it may go off any time right in your\nface. An\u2019 Tony, didn\u2019t I give you my reasons for jumpin\u2019 \u2019em at all\nbefore we got here? You\u2019ll know when you\u2019ve been workin\u2019 at this work as\nlong as I have that news can travel fast--mighty fast. How was we to\nknow they wouldn\u2019t recognize us, from a description or somethin\u2019? How\nwas we to know one of \u2019em wasn\u2019t a bull? An\u2019 lastly, how was we to know\nbut what they might try to stick us up, if we didn\u2019t get the hop on\n\u2019em--an\u2019 us just oozin\u2019 cash? We couldn\u2019t answer a one of them questions\n\u2019til we seen what was what, could we? Play it safe, boys,\u201d he ended,\npatronizingly conscious of his superior astuteness, \u2018an\u2019 you\u2019ll always\ncome out on top, even if you do make it unpleasant for the other feller\nsometimes. See?\u201d\n\nHe teetered ponderously on the heels of his moccasins and drew forth a\nsilver case.\n\n\u201cHave one?\u201d he offered, holding it out to Henderson and Hartley. \u201cNo?\nSorry.\u201d\n\nHe lit a cigaret with a flourish. The old man paused in his snarling\nefforts to twist out of his bonds and coughed savagely, but his partner\nlay quiet, a scared look in his eyes.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the leader of the gang, \u201clet\u2019s rustle some grub. Here--\u201d he\nstirred Henderson with his foot--\u201cwhere\u2019s the breadbox?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet your foot off me!\u201d burst out Henderson. \u201cWhat kind of a game you\ntryin\u2019 to pull off, anyway? Come into a man\u2019s cabin with your hifalutin\u2019\ngabble an\u2019 tie him up. Lemme go!\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you rustle some grub if I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot by a durn sight I won\u2019t!\u201d the old man roared. \u201cI\u2019d rustle you an\u2019\nyour dirty gang to ---- out o\u2019 here, if I had a gun!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah--if,\u201d taunted the fat man. Then, \u201cWhy ain\u2019t you got one?\u201d he\nsnapped suspiciously.\n\n\u201cThat young idiot lost it somewheres, that\u2019s why,\u201d gritted Henderson,\nwhile the \u201cyoung idiot\u201d gave fervent though silent thanks for his\npartner\u2019s quick wit.\n\nThe fat man turned to Hartley, who shrank away.\n\n\u201cWell, you goin\u2019 to act nice an\u2019 sociable an\u2019 cook us up some grub? We\ngot to move on pretty quick, an\u2019 it\u2019ll be all for the best if you hustle\nabout it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Nick eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlasted little slob,\u201d muttered Henderson.\n\n\u201cThere, that\u2019s something like,\u201d said the fat man heartily.\n\nHe was enjoying himself thoroughly. His manner became even more grand as\nhe continued:\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t every man has the privilege o\u2019 waitin\u2019 on me. I cut quite a\nfigure, down where I come from.\u201d He gestured, his cigaret held jauntily\nbetween his pudgy fingers. \u201cWhy, me an\u2019 my pals cleaned up a whole\nfortune in just two hours, not so many nights ago. Oh, it\u2019s all right\nPerry,\u201d he reassured his companion, who had turned with a warning oath\nfrom his task of loosening Nick\u2019s bonds so he could move about. \u201cI doubt\nif anybody\u2019s goin\u2019 to look for us up this way, an\u2019 I know our friends\nhere won\u2019t squeal on us.\u201d\n\nHe leered.\n\n\u201cTony\u2019s a good pard when it comes to disappearin\u2019, eh Tony?\u201d\n\nHe chuckled again, glowing more and more in the light of his own\nimportance as Tony grinned in a pleased way.\n\n\u201cSay,\u201d he said to Nick, who was digging out some meal from the food-box,\n\u201chustle that grub, you hear?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, I am, as fast as I can,\u201d answered Hartley.\n\nHenderson at this point made a furious effort to free himself, fairly\nbursting with rage.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the fat man, glancing at Henderson with a tolerant\nsmile. \u201cNow let\u2019s fix the fire. Gettin\u2019 a bit chilly, seems to me.\u201d\n\nNick started toward the fire-place.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more wood,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGo get some, then, don\u2019t stand there like a fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to dig for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter let me go, Cap,\u201d said Perry.\n\nNick looked at him in ill-concealed relief.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d snapped the fat man, noting the glance. \u201cWhat the ---- are you\nbuttin\u2019 in here for? Let the boy go. He knows where \u2019t is, an\u2019 I\u2019ll bet\nmy shirt he won\u2019t try to run off in all this snow an\u2019 cold. You bring in\nall the snowshoes an\u2019 duffle while I turn him loose.\u201d\n\nAs Perry came back with a load of packs and snowshoes the leader said to\nNick:\n\n\u201cNow, then, young feller, don\u2019t go tryin\u2019 any monkeyshines. You bring\nthat wood in peaceable, or--\u201d\n\nQuick as light his right hand fluttered and a bullet spat into the\nthreshold of the door, so that Perry\u2019s descending foot covered the hole.\n\nEven Henderson, crouched against the wall and watching his partner with\nveiled speculation and anxiety, was impressed by this display. He drew\nin his breath sharply. Nick was frankly frightened.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said the fat man, replacing the automatic in his hip pocket. \u201cAn\u2019\nPerry an\u2019 Tony are most as good as that, too. It\u2019s easier to draw from a\nholster,\u201d he added in explanation.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d answered Nick. \u201cI\u2019ll be as quick as I can.\u201d\n\nHis bonds were removed and he hurried out, rubbing his wrists.\n\n\u201cShut that door!\u201d roared the fat man.\n\nNick rushed back and closed it.\n\nThe fat man turned to Henderson.\n\n\u201cHow long will it take him to get that wood?\u201d he inquired. \u201cNo fooling,\nnow!\u201d\n\nHis hand flickered as Henderson hesitated.\n\n\u201cNot very long,\u201d said the old man hastily. \u201c\u2019Bout five-ten minutes, I\nguess. He\u2019s got to burrer down into the snow, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fat man walked about the room restlessly, glancing here and there.\nThe candle sputtered. The graying coals of the fire settled with a\nwhispered crunch.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll ye do wid dese fellers, Cap?\u201d inquired Tony after a while.\n\n\u201cJust wait till we\u2019ve had some food, an\u2019 we\u2019ll decide,\u201d answered the fat\nman. \u201cSay, though, it\u2019s lucky you knew about this place, Tony. I\u2019m near\nstarved.\u201d\n\nHe grinned as he continued:\n\n\u201cIf you birds hadn\u2019t been fightin\u2019 I dunno as we\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 found you at\nthat, in all this ---- snow. Too dark to see much, but Tony heard a\nthumpin\u2019 an\u2019 crashin\u2019 along the bank o\u2019 the river somewhere, so we\nbreezed over. We come away in a bit of a hurry from where we last was,\nan\u2019 we\u2019re in a bit of a hurry to git where we\u2019re goin\u2019, up to Tony\u2019s\nplace, so this makes it pretty nice. Where the ----\u2019s that other guy?\nI\u2019m gittin\u2019 cold.\u201d\n\nTony loosed his revolver in its holster and started silently for the\ndoor, but just then Nick\u2019s voice was heard, asking them to open up. He\nstamped shivering into the room, covered with snow from head to heels,\ncarrying a great load of logs.\n\n\u201cEasy does it, young feller,\u201d said the fat man, watching like a cat as\nHartley staggered to the hearth.\n\nTony and Perry closed in behind him, ready for anything.\n\nNick squatted down and dropped the logs carefully before the fire. He\nselected some small, dry splints and put them on the coals, blowing\ngently until they burst into flame. He gave one quick glance around him\nbefore he carefully reached forward and placed a larger piece on the\nblaze. Then with a sharp exclamation of pain he yanked his hands back\nfrom the scorching heat, to wipe them on his shirt front, and in the\nsame instant leaped erect and whirled to one side. A revolver appeared\nin each of his hands, and before one could think two spurts of flame\nshot out. The fat man yelled and careened against the wall, clutching\nhis right shoulder. Perry crooked his arm with a startled oath as his\ngun, holster and all, was torn from his numbed fingers.\n\n\u201cUp!\u201d snapped Nick, and the bewildered Tony obeyed.\n\nHenderson dived across the room, leaped prodigiously and sunk his head\nin the fat man\u2019s stomach. The fat man, who was clawing wildly for his\ngun with his left hand, grunted and crumpled to the floor in agony.\nPerry at this instant recovered his wits and rushed forward, snarling,\nto stagger back, blinded by the impact of a gun-barrel across his eyes.\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d yelled Henderson, squatting before his partner.\n\nNick lowered one gun, still covering Tony with the other. Henderson\ngrasped the barrel between his wrists and held it against the rawhide\nthongs.\n\n\u201cShoot!\u201d he said, and Nick pulled the trigger.\n\nThe old man jumped up. His hands and moccasins were scorched, but he was\nfree. He grabbed Tony\u2019s gun and covered Perry before the cursing man had\ncleared his eyes of dizziness and blood.\n\nA minute later the three invaders lay bound hand and foot. Nick and\nHenderson stood looking down at them.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Nick, \u201cit\u2019s easier to draw from your shirt front than\nyour pocket, but I\u2019m pretty near as good as you, ain\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nHe bent to examine the fat man\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cOnly a flesh wound,\u201d he said to his partner. \u201cI didn\u2019t dare to try for\nhis gun in this light. It was too far behind him. That was a good one\nyou gave him, all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d returned Henderson. \u201cWhy, I was all ready an\u2019 waitin\u2019 for that\nplay. What about the one you give Perry, huh?\u201d\n\nThe fat man groaned and eased over on his side.\n\n\u201cSay,\u201d he wheezed craftily. \u201cA man that can shoot like you can is\nwastin\u2019 his time out in this ---- place. Why don\u2019t you two come in with\nus? There\u2019s forty thousand in bills amongst us three. We\u2019ll split it\nfive ways--eight thousand apiece. What about it?\u201d\n\nHenderson spat. Nick grinned.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cNot us, I guess. I seen your face in the papers too\nmany times a couple o\u2019 years ago, an\u2019 I bet it\u2019s there today, too.\nYou\u2019re wanted bad back in the States, old boy, an\u2019 I know it.\u201d\n\nHe turned to his partner.\n\n\u201cJim, they\u2019s no use us two tryin\u2019 to take this gang out to the Poste.\nI\u2019ll start off now an\u2019 bring in the sheriff an\u2019 a few others to help.\nI\u2019ll be out there tomorrow night an\u2019 back the next. All right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, only hustle. We don\u2019t want this place to be a pig-pen any\nlonger \u2019n we can help. Besides, we got to get out on the lines pretty\nquick.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen.\u201d The fat man saw it was no use to try to bribe his captors.\n\u201cYou got us, an\u2019 I don\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t my fault, not takin\u2019 Tony\u2019s\nadvice an\u2019 comin\u2019 in peaceable, instead o\u2019 stagin\u2019 a hold-up.\u201d He gave a\ntwisted smile as Tony cursed him heartily. \u201cBut you\u2019d never \u2019a\u2019 done it\nwithout pullin\u2019 that hid gun stunt. I wish you\u2019d tell me before you go\njust how in ---- you did that.\u201d\n\nThis question was burning in Henderson\u2019s mind as well, though he gave no\nsign, only smiled a superior, tolerant smile as if such a thing was of\nevery-day occurrence.\n\n\n",
