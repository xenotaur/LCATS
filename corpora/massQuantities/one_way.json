There's no disgrace about it, of course;\nwe just didn't feel like having all the neighbors see the big skycar\nwith LYDNA PROJECT painted on its side, and then having them drop in\ncasually to express what they would call interest and we would know to\nbe curiosity.\n\nThere are people who boast that their sons and daughters have been\npicked for Lydna. What is there to boast about? It's pure chance, within\nlimits.\n\nAnd Hal is our only child and we love him.\n\nLucy didn't say a word all the way back from saying good-by to him. Lucy\nand I have been married now for 27 years and I guess I know her about as\nwell as anybody on Earth does. People who don't know her so well think\nshe's cold. But I knew what feelings she was crushing down inside her.\n\nBesides, I wasn't feeling much like talking myself. I was remembering\ntoo many things:\n\nHal at about two, looking up at me--when I would come home dead-tired\nfrom a hard day of being chewed at by half a dozen bosses right up to\nthe editor-in-chief whenever anything went the least bit out of\nkilter--with a smile that made all my tiredness disappear. Hal, when I'd\npick him up at school, proudly displaying a Cybernetics Approval Slip\n(and ignoring the fact that half the other kids had one, too). Hal the\nday I took him to the Beard Removal Center, certain that he was a man,\nnow that he was old enough for depilation. Hal that morning two weeks\nago, setting out to get his Vocational Assignment Certificate....\n\nThat's when I stopped remembering.\n\nIt had been five years after our marriage before they let us start a\nchild: some question about Lucy's uncle and my grandmother. Most parents\naren't as old as we are when they get the news and usually have other\nchildren left, so it isn't so bad.\n\n\n\nWhen we got home, Lucy still was silent. She took off her scarf and\ncloak and put them away, and then she pushed the button for dinner\nwithout even asking me what I wanted. I noticed, though, that she was\nordering all the things I like. We both had the day off, of course, to\ngo and say good-by to Hal--Lucy is a technician at Hydroponics Center.\n\nI felt awkward and clumsy. Her ways are so different from mine; I\nexplode and then it's over--just a sore place where it hurts if I touch\nit. Lucy never explodes, but I knew the sore place would be there\nforever, and getting worse instead of better.\n\nWe ate dinner in silence, though neither of us felt hungry, and had the\ntable cleared. Then it was nearly 19 o'clock and I had to speak.\n\n\"The takeoff will be at 19:10,\" I said. \"Want me to tune in now? Last\nyear, when Mutro was Solar President, he gave a good speech before the\nkids left.\"\n\n\"Don't turn it on at all!\" she said sharply. Then, in a softer voice,\nshe added: \"Of course, Frank, turn it on whenever you like. I'll just go\nto my room and open the soundproofing.\"\n\nThere were still no tears in her eyes.\n\nI thought of a thousand things to say: Don't you want to catch a glimpse\nof Hal in the crowd going up the ramp? Mightn't they let the kids wave a\nlast farewell to their folks listening and watching in? Mightn't\nsomething in the President's speech make us feel a little better?\n\nBut I heard myself saying, \"Never mind, Lucy. Don't go. I'll leave the\nthing off.\"\n\nI didn't want to be alone. I wanted Lucy there with me.\n\nSo we sat out the whole time of the visicast, side by side on the\nwindow-couch, holding hands. I'll say this for the neighbors--they must\nall have known, for Hal was the first to be selected from Homefield in\nnearly 40 years, and the newscast must have announced it over and over,\nbut not a single person on the whole 62 floors of the house butted in on\nus. Not even that snoopy student from Venus in 47-14, who's always\ndropping in on other tenants and taking notes on \"the mores of Earth\nAboriginals.\" People can be very decent sometimes. We needn't have\nworried about coming home in the Lydna Project bus.\n\nIt was no good trying to keep my mind on anything else. Whether I wanted\nto or not, I had to relive the two last hours we'd ever have with Hal.\n\nIt couldn't mean to him what it meant to us. We were losing; he was both\nlosing and gaining. We were losing our whole lives for 21 years past; he\nwas, too, but he was entering a new life we would never know anything\nabout. No word ever comes from Lydna; that's part of the project. Nobody\neven knows where it is for sure, though it's supposed to be one of the\nouter asteroids.\n\nBoth boys and girls are sent and there must be marriages and\nchildren--though probably the death-rate is pretty high, for every year\nthey have to select 200 more from Earth to keep the population balanced.\nWe would never know if our son married there, or whom, or when he died.\nWe would never see our grandchildren, or even know if we had any.\n\n\n\nHal was a good son and I think we were fairly good parents and had made\nhis childhood happy. But at 21, faced with a great, mysterious adventure\nand an unknown and exciting future, a boy can't be expected to be\ndrowned in grief at saying good-by to his humdrum old father and mother.\nIt might have been tougher for him 200 years ago, when they hadn't\nlearned to decondition children early from parental fixations. But no\nyoungster today would possess that kind of unwholesome dependency. If he\ndid, he would never have been selected for Lydna in the first place.\n\nThat's one comfort we have--it's a sort of proof we had reared a child\nfar above the average.\n\nIt was just weakness in me to half wish that Hal hadn't been so healthy,\nso handsome, so intelligent, so fine in character.\n\nThey were a wonderful lot. We said our good-bys in an enormous room of\nthe spaceport, with this year's 200 selectees there from all over Earth,\neach with the relatives and whoever else had permission to make the last\nvisit. I suppose it's a matter of accommodations and transportation, for\nnobody's allowed more than three. So it was mostly parents, with a few\nbrothers, sisters and sweethearts or friends. The selectees themselves\nchoose the names. After all, they've had two weeks after they were\nnotified to say good-by to everyone else who matters to them.\n\nMost of the time, all I could keep my mind on was Hal, trying to fix\nforever in my memory every last detail of him. We have dozens of sound\nstereos, of course, but this was the last time.\n\nStill, it's my business at the News Office, and has been for 30 years,\nto observe people and form conclusions about them, so I couldn't help\nnoticing with a professional eye some of the rest of the selectees.\n(This farewell visit is a private affair, and the press is barred, which\nis why I'd never been there before.)\n\nThere were two kinds of selectees that stood out, in my mind. One was\nthose who had nobody at all to see them off. Completely alone, poor\nkids--orphans, doubtless, with no families and apparently not even\nfriends near enough to matter. But, in a way, they would be the\nhappiest; life on Earth couldn't have been very rewarding for them, and\non Lydna they might find companionship. (If only companionship in\nmisery, I thought--but I shied away from that. In our business, there\nare always leaks; we know--or guess--a few things about Lydna nobody\nelse does, outside the authorities themselves. But we keep our mouths\nshut.)\n\nThe ones that tore my hearts were the boys and girls in love. They never\ntake married people for Lydna, but a machine can't tell what a boy or\ngirl is feeling about another girl or boy, and it's a machine that does\nthe selecting. There's no use putting up an argument, for, once made,\nthe choice is inexorable and unchangeable. In my work as a newsgatherer,\nI've heard some terrible stories. There have been suicide pacts and\nmurders.\n\n\n\nYou could tell the couples in love. Not that there were any scenes. If\nthere had been any in the two weeks past, they were over. But anybody\nwho has learned to read human reactions, as I have, could recognize the\nagony those youngsters were going through.\n\nI felt a deep gratitude that Hal wasn't one of them. He'd had his share\nof adolescent affairs, of course, but I was sure he was still just\nplaying around. He'd seen a lot of Bet Milen, a girl a class ahead of\nhim in school and college, but I didn't think she meant more to him than\nany of the others. If she had, she'd have been along to say good-by, but\nhe'd asked for only the two of us. She was now a laboratory assistant in\nour hospital and could easily have gotten the time off.\n\nIt was growing late, almost midnight, and Lucy and I had to be at work\ntomorrow, no matter how we felt. I forced myself to talk, with Lucy's\nsilent pain smothering me like a force-blanket. I made an effort and\ncleared my throat.\n\n\"Lucy, go to bed and turn on the hypno and try to get some sleep.\"\n\nLucy stood up obediently, but she shook her head. \"You go, dear,\" she\nsaid, her voice firm. \"I can't. I--\"\n\nThe roof buzzer sounded. Somebody had landed in a copter and wanted us.\n\n\"Don't answer,\" I said quickly. \"There's nobody we want to see--\"\n\nBut she had already pushed the button to open the door.\n\nIt was Bet Milen, the girl Hal used to go around with.\n\nI braced myself. This might be bad. She might have cared more for Hal\nthan we had guessed.\n\nBut she didn't look grief-stricken. She looked excited, and determined,\nand a little bit frightened.\n\nShe scarcely glanced at me. She went right up to Lucy and took both\nLucy's hands in hers.\n\n\"Well,\" she said in a clipped, tense voice, \"we made it.\"\n\nThen Lucy broke for the first time. The tears ran down her face and she\ndidn't even wipe them away. \"Are you _certain_?\"\n\n\"Positive. And I got word to him. We'd agreed on a code. That's why he\ndidn't want me there today--we couldn't trust ourselves not to betray\nit, either way.\"\n\nI stood there staring at them, bewildered.\n\n\"What's this all about?\" I demanded. \"Have you two cooked up some crazy\nscheme to rescue Hal? I hope to heaven not! It would ruin all of us,\nincluding him!\"\n\n\n\nThe wild daydreams I'd had myself flashed through my mind--the drug that\nwould seem to kill him and wouldn't, the anonymous false accusation of\nsubversion, the previous secret marriage. All impossible, all fatal.\n\nLucy disengaged her hands from the girl's and slipped her arm through\nmine.\n\n\"You tell him, Bet,\" she said gently. \"You're the one who should.\"\n\nI'd never noticed how pretty the girl was till then, when she stood\nthere with her face flushed and her eyes straight on mine. A pang went\nthrough me; if only she and Hal could have--\n\n\"No, Mr. Sturt,\" she said, \"we haven't rescued Hal. He's gone. But we've\nrescued part of him. I'm going to have his baby.\"\n\n\"Bet's going to live with us and be our daughter, Frank,\" Lucy\nexplained. \"Hal and she and I worked it out in these two weeks, after\nthey came to me and told me how they felt about each other. We couldn't\ntell you till we were sure; I couldn't bear to have you hope and then be\ndisappointed--it would be enough for me to have to suffer that.\"\n\n\"That is, I'll come if you want me here, Mr. Sturt,\" said Bet.\n\nI had to sit down before I could speak. \"Of course I want you. But what\nabout your own family?\"\n\n\"I haven't any. My mother's dead and my father's an engineer on Ganymede\nand gets home on leave about once in three years. I've been living in a\nyouth hostel.\"\n\n\"But look here--\" I turned to Lucy--\"how on Earth can you know? Two\nweeks or less is no time--\"\n\nLucy gave me a look I recognized, the patient one of the scientist for\nthe layman.\n\n\"The Chow-Visalius test, dear. One day after the fertilized ovum starts\ndividing--\"\n\n\"And I ran it myself every day for over a week. That's one of my jobs in\nthe lab and it was easy to slip in another specimen. And it didn't, and\nit didn't and I went nearly out of my mind--\"\n\n\"Every time Hal entered the apartment, I'd look at him and he'd shake\nhis head,\" Lucy interrupted. \"It meant everything to him. And it would\njust have broken my heart--\"\n\n\"Mine, too,\" Bet said softly. \"And his. And today was the last chance. I\nwas scared to try it. This afternoon at 14:30, just before the farewell\nvisits, was the deadline for viz messages to any of them. If I'd had to\nsend mine without the word we'd agreed on that would tell him it was all\nright--But it was, at last! And now he knows, even if I never--even if\nwe never--Excuse me, please, it's been a strain. I'm afraid I'm going to\nbawl.\"\n\n\n\nWe let her alone. Kids nowadays hate to be fussed over.\n\nUs, we'd lost our son, and that was going to stay with us forever. But\nnow we would have his child to love and--\n\nAn appalling thought struck me suddenly. I can't imagine why I hadn't\nrealized it sooner. All this emotion, I suppose.\n\n\"Good God!\" I cried. \"An illegal child! We can't keep it!\"\n\n\"Nobody's going to know,\" Lucy replied calmly. \"Bet's going to live with\nus, and when it starts to show, she's going to take her allowed leave.\nWe'll take ours, too, and we'll all go on a trip--to Mars, maybe, or\nVenus--one of the settled colonies where we can rent a house. Babies\ndon't _have_ to be born in hospitals, you know; our ancestors had them\nright at home. She's strong and healthy and I know what to do. Then\nwe'll come back here and we'll have a baby with us that we adopted\nwherever we were. Nobody will ever know.\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said in a voice I tried to keep from rising. \"There are four\nbillion people on Earth and about 28 billion in the colonized Solar\nplanets. Every one of those people is on record at Central Cybernetics.\nHow do you suppose you're going to get away with the phony adoption of a\nnon-existent child? The first time you have to take it to a baby clinic,\nthey'll find it has no card.\"\n\n\"I thought of that,\" Lucy said, \"and it can be done, because it must.\nFrank, for heaven's sake, use your wits! You're a newsgatherer. You know\nall sorts of people everywhere.\"\n\n\"I don't know any machines. And it's machines that handle the records.\"\n\n\"Machines under the supervision of humans.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said sarcastically. \"I just go to my ex-newsgatherer pal who\nfeeds the records to Io or Ceres and say, 'Look, old fellow, do me a\nfavor, will you? My wife wants to adopt a baby from your colony, so just\nmake up the names of two people and give them a life-check, invent their\nancestors back to the time Central Cybernetics was established, and then\nslip in cards for their marriage, and the birth of their child--I'll let\nyou know later whether to make it a boy or a girl--and then their\ndeaths; and then my wife and I can adopt that made-up baby.'\n\n\"What kind of blackmailing hold do you think I have on any record\nofficial,\" I asked angrily, \"to make him do a thing like that and keep\nhis mouth shut about it? I could be eliminated for treason for even\nmaking such a suggestion.\"\n\n\"Frank, _think_! Surely there must be _some_ way!\"\n\n\n\nAnd then it struck me. \"Wait! I just got an idea. When I said 'treason,'\njust now--It might barely be possible--\"\n\n\"Oh, what?\"\n\n\"It would have to be Mars, the North Polar Cap colony. The K-Alph\nConspiracy messed things up there badly.\"\n\n\"I remember, Mr. Sturt!\" Bet said excitedly. \"They wrecked everything in\nthe three months before the rebellion was crushed, didn't they?\"\n\n\"Everything including their cybernetics equipment. Central doesn't want\nit known, but I have inside information that it's still not in going\ncondition. That colony is full of children who have never been\nregistered. And I doubt if it will be in 100 per cent shape for the best\npart of another year. Those hellions really did a job. Let's see--this\nis the end of Month Two. We'd have to get away around Month Eight at the\nlatest and the baby would be born--when exactly, Bet?\"\n\n\"Early in Month Twelve. We could all be back here again by the first of\nnext year, or even by the end of Month Thirteen.\"\n\n\"Well, I have enough accumulated leave for that and I guess you have\ntoo, Lucy; neither of us has taken more than two or three weeks for\nyears. But what about you, Bet? You've been working less than a year.\"\n\n\"I can borrow it. Our director is crazy about travel and she'll be all\nfor it when I tell her I have a chance to go to Mars for a long visit.\nBesides, she knows about Hal and me--I mean the way we are about each\nother--and she'll understand that I'd want to get away for a while now.\"\n\nAsher, my editor-in-chief, would feel the same way, I thought, and so\nwould Lucy's boss.\n\n\"I knew you'd find a way,\" remarked my wife complacently.\n\nI looked at the telechron.\n\n\"We've all got to be at work in seven hours,\" I said, \"if we expect to\nget through before the end of the afternoon. What say we turn in?\"\n\n\"You stay here with us, Bet,\" said Lucy. \"You parked your copter in our\nport, didn't you? Frank, I think we need a drink.\"\n\nI pushed the buttons. Nobody said anything, but somehow it was a toast\nto Hal. I know the liquor had to get past a lump in my throat and the\nwomen were both crying. It wasn't like my self-contained Lucy. I guess\nshe thought so herself, for she braced herself. But her voice was still\ntrembling when she turned to Bet.\n\n\"A year from now,\" she said, \"we'll all be back here in this room and,\nthis time, part of Hal will be here with us--his son, our little Hal.\"\n\n\"It might be our little Hallie.\" Bet smiled through her tears. \"It will\nbe ten weeks before I can run the Schuster test to find out.\"\n\n\"It won't make any difference. Hal will never know that, but he'll know,\nway out there on Lydna, that his baby has been born. He'll know, even\nthough he can never see it--or us.\"\n\n\n\nLucy blinked, then went on bravely. \"Every time he looks in a mirror\nthere, he'll say to himself, 'Well, back on Earth, there's a little tyke\nwith my blue eyes and my curly hair and my mouth and nose and chin,\nwho's going to grow up to be tall and straight like me--or maybe like\nBet, but also a lot like me.'\n\n\"And as he grows older, he can think back to the way he was as a child\nand a boy and a man, and know that his son, or his daughter, will be\nfeeling and thinking and looking some day just about the way he himself\nis then, and it will be a link with Earth and with us--\"\n\nThat was when I had to go to the window and look out for a long time to\npull myself together before I could face them again.\n\nLydna is top-top secret, but as I've said before, we newsgatherers get\ninside information.\n\nI have a pretty shrewd idea of what the mysterious Lydna Project is.\nIt's to alter human beings so they can adapt to the colonization of\nouter space.\n\nThe medics do things to them to enable them and their descendants to\nresist every possible condition of temperature and radiation and\ngravity. They have to alter the genes--acquired characters would be of\nuse only in a short-term project, and this is long-term. But you can't\nalter genes without affecting the individual.\n\nWe'd have Hal's normal child.\n\nBut when Hal got to Lydna, he and the rest of them would be shocked and\nsick for a while at sight of some of the inhabitants. And if he had any\nchildren on Lydna, we, back here, would scarcely recognize them as\nhuman. Some of them might have extra limbs. Some might have eyes and\nears in odd places. Some might have lungs outside their bodies, or\nbrains without a skull.\n\nBy that time, Hal himself would have got over being sick--unless, some\ntime, he got hold of a mirror and remembered the boy he used to be.\n\n\n\n\n",
