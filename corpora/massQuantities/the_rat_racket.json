    "body": "Richard Moyer, senior partner of the firm of Moyer & Perkins, read that\nletter over twice before he called in the man who had helped him make\nthe importing of high grade groceries from England a most profitable\nbusiness for over twenty years.\n\nHe simply handed the letter over to Paul Perkins without a word of\nexplanation. The latter read it through and handed it back in equal\nsilence, but the hand that held the letter trembled.\n\n\"Just another racket,\" exclaimed Moyer, finally.\n\n\"Looks like it. I suppose we were foolish to start in paying for\nprotection. First our trucks were threatened; then the new building;\nafter that our best customers were bombed, and we had to pay to protect\nthem. Your son was kidnapped--and the police! They even went so far as\nto advise that we keep on paying--and now this letter! We might as well\nclose out the business. All our profits go toward supporting a gang of\ncriminals who have muscled into every type of American industry.\"\n\n\"On the face of it the letter looks innocent enough,\" sighed Perkins, as\nhe picked it up and gave it another reading. \"Simply says that the rat\nmenace is increasing, cites several business houses where the rodents\nhave done a great deal of damage, and offers to give our warehouses\ncomplete protection for five thousand a week. You could show that letter\nto a hundred police officials and they would laugh at your fears. But I\nam not laughing. Because that letter was written on the same damaged\ntypewriter that the other letters were written on and those gangsters\nhave not failed to make any of their threats good.\"\n\n\"Suppose we pretend that they are honest, and answer their letter and\nsend them a check for the first week's protection?\"\n\n\"They will laugh at you and send back the check.\"\n\n\"They may, at that. Then we will give them the cash. In either case, it\nwill give us time to think. I feel that they are only experimenting with\nus. They are after larger game than five thousand a week. We shall see\nand hear more of this rat business in a while. Write to them and tell\nthem that we will pay the cash, and put the entire matter in the hands\nof the Chamber of Commerce. If it does not act soon, the entire city\nwill be in the hands of the gangsters.\"\n\nThe complaint of Moyer & Perkins was only one of a dozen similar ones\nwhich reached the Chamber of Commerce that day. In a secluded room of\nthe Manufacturers' Club a dozen wealthy men met day after day, hearing\nand weighing evidence against a hundred forms of racketeering which was\nrapidly becoming a terrible and powerful enemy to the varied industries\nof the Metropolis. Practically every business had been threatened and\nmore than one captain of industry blustered openly, but paid his weekly\ntribute silently in order to protect his business, family, and home.\n\nUp to this time the usual weapon had been the strong arm man and the\nbomb. While these were bad enough, they were at least understood. When\nit came to rats, it was different. Of course, everybody knew something\nabout rats--that they were supposed to be numerous around the river\nfronts and warehouses--but on the other hand, rats were seldom seen in\ndaylight, and there were many New Yorkers who never saw one.\n\nNot one of the dozen men had been raised on a farm and none had served\nin the trenches during the World War. They did not understand rats, so,\nthey hesitated, and finally simply advised the merchants who had\nreceived the rat letters to use their own judgement. As a result, some\npaid tribute and some did not. There is no evidence to show that those\nwho paid were one hundred per cent free from rats in their warehouses,\nbut within a week there was ample proof that at least three wholesale\ngroceries and one laundry had been invaded overnight by rats in\nsufficient quantity to cause thousands of dollars' worth of damages.\nMoyer & Perkins heard the news and decided to pay another five thousand.\n\nThe Defense Committee of the Chamber of Commerce was called to an extra\nmeeting at the El Dorado Hotel. The owner of the hotel was one of the\nCommittee, a man who, so far, had taken a very inactive part in its\ntransactions. He did not waste time in giving the reason for the special\nmeeting.\n\n\"I was called on the telephone this morning,\" he explained. \"The person\nat the other end wanted to protect my hotel from rats for the small\ncompensation of twenty-five thousand dollars a week. He referred\ncasually to the three warehouses and one laundry that had been wrecked\nlast week. Right at the present time I have, on an average, twelve\nhundred guests a night. They are here to be entertained, not to be\nfrightened by rats. But here is the point. If I yield, every other hotel\nin the city will be placed in a similar position. Three hundred thousand\nstrangers are in the city every day. Suppose that ten hotels were\noverrun with rats in one week and the fact was circulated in the press?\nWhat would that cost the city?\"\n\n\"Better pay it,\" growled one of the men. He happened to own a hotel. He\nknew how temperamental was the pleasure-seeking stranger. Singularly,\nthat advice was the only brand given by the rest of the Committee. They\nseemed strangely unable to offer any remedy except to keep on paying and\nin every way possible bar unpleasant news from the newspapers.\n\nInside of next month, fifty-five hotels were paying a weekly tax to the\nrat racketeers. One small hotel refused, and was at once deluged with an\narmy of rats which drove out guests and employees, killed one old scrub\nwoman and severely injured twenty of the cooks, waiters and porters who\nreceived the brunt of the rodent onslaught.\n\nMoyer & Perkins were still paying the five thousand a week when, to\ntheir surprise, a visitor dropped into their office and casually\nsuggested that they sell him their business.\n\n\"It used to be a good business,\" explained Moyer.\n\n\"It still is,\" interrupted Perkins. \"What my partner means is this. We\nhave our share of trade, but the overhead has become so heavy that we\nhave not been able to make any money lately.\"\n\n\"That is what I understand,\" commented the stranger. \"In fact, I was\nsent here by the Chamber of Commerce. They told me you had been paying\nmoney for rat protection. That is about the only reason I want to buy\nyour business. Your business is supposed to be worth about two hundred\nthousand and your real estate as much more. Suppose I give you half a\nmillion and advise you to keep quiet about the sale?\"\n\n\"You mean carry on the business under the old name?\" asked Moyer,\nlooking at the prospective buyer earnestly.\n\n\"Something like that.\"\n\nThe Englishman shook his head.\n\n\"Not and remain in this country! They kidnapped my son. No telling what\nthey will do next, if the policies of the firm are changed. Anything\nthat is done we shall be blamed for, no matter who really owns the\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Then, you and your partner take a vacation in Europe. You can afford\nit. All I am asking for is an exact account of your transactions with\nthese racketeers, so I can have something to work on.\"\n\n\"May I ask what you want to do with the business?\" interrogated the\nJunior Partner, Perkins.\n\n\"Certainly. I intend to use it as one of my experimental laboratories\nfor the study of a mammal, known as the _Mus Norvegicus_, called, in\ncommon English, the brown rat. He is supposed to have originated from\nthe _Mus Humiliatus_ of Central Asia. Now will you gentlemen take the\nhalf million?\"\n\n\"We will!\" exclaimed Perkins. \"Then may I ask your name?\"\n\n\"Winifred Willowby.\"\n\n\"Not the one who is reputed to own more United States bonds than any\nother man in America?\" gasped Richard Moyer.\n\n\"I won't admit that I do, but I am the man you are thinking about.\"\n\n\"Then I simply cannot understand why you want to mix up in this rat\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Simple enough. I am a hundred per cent American. For five generations\nmy people have been born and buried in this city. I own over two hundred\nmillion dollars worth of land here. When the dregs of Europe come over\nto my city and use the rats of Asia to bleed that city white, then I\npersonally protest. I am going to start something. I am not sure what,\nbut when I finish, this city will be practically rat empty and gangster\nfree.\"\n\n\"A large programme, Mr. Willowby,\" whispered Perkins.\n\n\"But I am a large man. Now, suppose I write you gentlemen a check?\"\n\nFive minutes later the two partners were alone. Moyer looked at the\ncheck, then put it in his pocket, and his hat on his head.\n\n\"Suppose we get it cashed?\" he said to Perkins. \"You can do as you\nplease with your half, but I am going to take my family and go back to\nEngland. That man Willowby is only half pint size, but his blue eyes\nlook cold to me, and I bet he plays a stiff game of bridge. If he starts\nfighting those gangsters, I do not want to be caught on the\nbattlefield.\"\n\n\"How about starting a business over in England?\" asked Perkins.\n\n\"Not a bad idea. I came over here and together we made half a million\nselling English groceries to Americans. Perhaps we can make a million\nmore selling American groceries to Englishmen.\"\n\nWinifred Willowby not only bought the grocery business of Mover &\nPerkins; he bought a laundry, a small hotel, an apartment house and a\ntheatre. He kept all the old employees, put in a manager, instructed\nthat the weekly tribute should be paid as usual, and then disappeared\nfrom New York City.\n\nTen days later, in Paradise Valley, in the broken country below the\nPoconos of Pennsylvania, he entertained several men, each an authority\nin his special line of art or science. They kept the appointment, not\nbeing at all sure what it was for, but unable to refuse the invitation\nwhich was accompanied in each case with a substantial check. They had\nall heard of Willowby, but none had ever seen him. No doubt all were\nrather disappointed at his apparent lack of color and personality. They\nquickly changed their mind when he started to talk, for there was a man\nwho, when he had something to say, was able to say it briefly and to the\npoint.\n\n\"You men are all interested in rats,\" he began, \"and so am I. You have\nworked with rats in one way or another for a good many years. Perhaps I\nought to introduce you to each other. Mr. William Rastell has written\nthe best biological study of rats in the English language. He has done\nfor rats what Beebe did for the pheasant. Now the gentleman next to Mr.\nRastell is Mr. Carol Crawford. I doubt if he ever actually saw or\nwillingly handled a rat in all his life, but I am told he knows more\nabout the folklore and traditions of the rat than any other living\nperson. The third of my guests is Professor Wilson. He is the\npsychologist who has tried to breed different strains of rats, some of\nsuperior intelligence and others of the imbecile type. What I want you\ngentlemen to tell me is why these rats congregate at times in certain\nbuildings of New York City, in such large numbers that they are a\nserious menace to property and even human life, and, then, as suddenly\ndisappear as they appeared.\"\n\n\"Are they actually doing that?\" asked Professor Wilson, who had suddenly\nbecome vitally interested in the conversation.\n\n\"Suppose they are?\" queried Carol Crawford, answering the question for\nWillowby. \"That is nothing more than they have done for centuries.\"\n\n\"Do you mean migratory movements?\" asked the biologist, Rastell. \"Rats\nhave always migrated.\"\n\n\"I mean nothing of the kind,\" protested Crawford. \"I mean their sudden\nappearance in a town or a building, their remaining there for a short\ntime and then their sudden disappearance. The folklore and fairy tales\nare full of that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"That is why I asked you to come to this conference, Mr. Crawford,\"\nexplained Willowby. \"There is something peculiar happening in New York\nat the present time, and it has to do with rats and their actions. In\nsome way rats of New York seem to be under the control of a set of\nracketeers who are able to force them to enter any building they select.\nThe rats come and go suddenly. It is all over in a little while, but\nwhen they are in the building, they do a lot of damage.\"\n\nMr. Crawford interrupted him.\n\n\"I doubt if you use the right word, when you say the rats were forced to\nenter the building. Perhaps you mean that the rats were by some means\nplaced in such a psychic condition that they wanted to enter the\nbuilding.\"\n\n\"That brings the matter into my field of research,\" insisted Professor\nWilson. \"I doubt the fact that they were forced, but if they wanted to,\nwhy that brings up all kinds of interesting questions.\"\n\n\"That is what I am after, gentlemen. I simply want to present the\nproblem to you and have you solve it. I personally am satisfied with one\nthing. These rats are no different than the rats of five thousand years\nago. They are just like the rats of classic Greece and imperial Rome.\nMaybe Mr. Crawford will tell us how they acted.\"\n\nThe antiquarian fairly beamed as he started to ride his favorite\nhobby-horse.\n\n\"Of course, the story everyone thinks of is the one concerning the Piper\nof Hamelin. It was in the year 1284. The rats were thick, and the Piper\nagreed to lead them out of the town for a certain sum. He played a pipe,\nno doubt some kind of flute, and the rats followed him. When the people\nrefused to pay, he returned on the 26th of June, the feast of Saints\nJohn and Paul, and again played on the pipe. This time the children, one\nhundred and thirty in number, followed him into a cave and were lost.\nThe date is well documented. A number of historians believe that it\nactually occurred, and on the gate of the town is the statement.\n\n    \"'_CENTUM TER DENOS CUM\n     MAGUS AB URBE PUELLOS\n       DUXERAT ANTE ANNOS\n        CCLXXII CONDITA\n          PORTA FUIT._'[1]\n\n\"The same story is found, with variations, in all parts of the world.\nThere is, for example, the story of the wicked Hatto, abbot of Fulda. He\nwas visited by a swarm of rats who killed him. I can give you a dozen\nvariations of that story, but in each of them the rats came and went,\nsuddenly, as Mr. Willowby says they have been doing in New York.\"\n\n\"I should like to see a few examples of this mass movement of rats. I\nsaw a lemming migration in Norway, but that was different,\" explained\nRastell. \"It seems to me that if we actually saw one of these nocturnal\nattacks, we might learn why they wanted to do it.\"\n\n\"He is deadly right,\" agreed Professor Wilson. \"A few actual facts are\nworth a hundred theories.\"\n\n\"That is why I have asked you to help me,\" explained the richest man in\nNew York. \"I have prepared some experimental stations for your use. I\ncan put you in a grocery warehouse and guarantee that inside of a week\nyou will see more rats than you ever dreamed of. I have a laundry and a\nsmall hotel. We can work out the details right now. All I am asking of\nyou is to find out, when the rats come, _why they come_ and, once we\nknow that, we can do something to solve this problem.\"\n\n\"The game looks interesting,\" declared the Professor of rat psychology.\n\"What I am interested in is why the rats do it. I am sure that it is\nbecause they want to do it, but are they forced to want to do it? It is\na problem that will take a lot of research to solve, but Rastell and I\ncan solve it. With all respects to our friend, Mr. Crawford, I think\nthat he had better stay away and just keep on reading about his little\npets. A few thousand vicious rats would be hard for him to deal with.\"\n\n\"I guess you are right,\" laughed Winifred Willowby. \"Crawford and I will\nstay here and read about it while you two do the actual scientific work.\nBy the way, Crawford, in that story of the Piper, what was given the\ncredit for drawing the rats out of the town?\"\n\n\"The tune that he played on the pipes!\"\n\n\"Check and double check. Now I would advise you gentlemen to locate some\nmusical instrument in that warehouse, and if you find one, experiment\nwith it. Of course, you will have to be rather clever to find it. In the\nfirst place, the people putting it there will have it under cover and\njust as soon as the mischief is done they will remove it.\"\n\n\"It is nothing like that,\" laughed Professor Wilson, almost in scorn.\n\"These are New York rats. It will take more than a little music to lead\nthem from their usual haunts. But Rastell and I will start in at once.\nGive us the address of the buildings and the authority to use them. How\nshall we know when the rats are going to come?\"\n\n\"They will appear within seven days after you stop the racket money.\nSuppose we adjourn the meeting? I want a few words in private with Mr.\nCrawford. You other gentlemen can get all the rest of the details from\nmy secretary. He will arrange your salary and expense account. Good\nnight.\"\n\nHe took Mr. Crawford into his bedroom.\n\n\"Do you really believe that story, Crawford?\"\n\n\"I positively do. And the people believe it. The Piper walked down the\nBungen-Strasse and to this day no music is ever played in that street.\nThey even date time in that town from the day the children disappeared.\"\n\n\"Then, there must be something in it. Suppose we go over to Europe and\nfind out something about that tune, the tune that drew the rats out of\nHamelin?\"\n\n\n\nRastell and Wilson followed out their programme. They went to the\ngrocery warehouse and made a rat survey. There were a few rodents there\nbut not many. Then they issued orders that the weekly payment of five\nthousand dollars be stopped. After that they spent their nights in the\nwarehouse. On the fifth night the rats came by the thousands. They\nappeared to be hunting for something, but in the meantime, they ate and\nsoiled whatever came their way. The local cats fought heroically, but\nwere soon killed and eaten. The rats came up from the cellar through the\nelevator shafts, up the steps, through the cracks in the floor, up and\nup till they started to run around the roof. Then, at four in the\nmorning, they started to leave, running down the steps in close\nformation, seemingly panic-stricken at their own temerity and anxious\nonly to return to their safe, dark haunts. The two scientists, in their\nwire observation cage, closed their note book, opened the door of the\ncage, and started to make a careful search of the building. It revealed\nnothing but the bones of cats and much spoiled food.\n\nFor the next two days they worked carefully through every part of the\nbuilding, hunting for something to explain the conduct of the rats. They\nfound nothing. All that they were sure of was the fact that the rats had\nbeen there, and that they had not come back.\n\nThe following week they repeated the experiment in the laundry. The\ncourse of events was the same. The payment was refused, then the rats\ncame, devoured and destroyed, stayed a night and left. Nothing was\nfound. They decided to go and have a conference with Winifred Willowby,\nbut he could not be located. The two scientists were left to their own\nresources. Having no other plausible plan of action, they selected the\nsmall hotel for their next experiment. This time they set a hundred wire\ntraps and caught several hundred living rats. These they subjected to\nevery known experiment, and at the end were forced to acknowledge that\nall they had learned left them in ignorance as to why the rats came just\nfor one night in such enormous numbers.\n\nTwo months later their employer sent for them. It appeared that he had\njust returned from Europe. He listened to their story, smiled kindly at\ntheir perplexity, suggested that they take a vacation and forget about\nrats for a while, paid all their bills, and discharged them. He even\nwent so far as to say that he was uninterested in rats, that it had just\nbeen a passing hobby and that just at present he was working on other\nmatters. So, he asked them to pass out of his life. But he and Carol\nCrawford went into the wilds of Pike County and did some experimenting\non his own account.\n\nMeantime, things were going from bad to worse in New York City. The rat\nracketeers were becoming bolder, and started to reach after larger game.\nThere were rumors that the Pennsylvania Railroad was paying to protect\nits terminal and that the Interurban was being bled white to keep the\nrats out of the subway. Of course, much of this was rumor and none of it\nreached the newspapers, but there is no doubt about the fact that eight\nmillion people were becoming rat-conscious and rat-afraid. It was\ngrowing into a worth-while racket, and those behind it were rapidly\nacquiring more than riches; they were growing so powerful that they felt\nable to control the city government.\n\nMore than one business tried to resist and more than one business awoke\nto find that it owned nothing but ruins. Rat protection was worthless\nwhen the enemy came by the hundred thousand and even million. The only\nworth-while defense against the multitudinous enemy was the payment of\nthe weekly tribute, small enough each week, but in the course of the\nyear taking the profits from most of the firms compelled to pay. Within\na year the average business in the city was working for the gangsters\nand content to, at least, be permitted to stay in business.\n\nThen the racket was transferred to other cities, slowly and on a small\nscale at first; then more boldly. Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington\nbegan to feel the pressure. The profits were divided, but always the\nmain share went to New York. For that was where the Big Boys were. And\nruling the Big Boys was the Old Man, who was so little known and so\nseldom seen that his very existence was questioned by some of the\nsmaller gangsters. No one knew how he had obtained his power, but no one\nwas brave enough to deny it. The fact remained that he simply ruled;\nreigned like a Caesar; dictated like a Napoleon. From back-stage he\npulled the wires to make his puppets dance.\n\nIt was this man who aroused the interest of Winifred Willowby. In other\ntimes, in former generations, in far-passed centuries, they might have\nruled Rome together, or split it in two ways over their dying bodies.\nBut in 1935 the short sword had been replaced by the ballot box and\ncivil war by the primary election. Neither man had much that the other\ncraved for, yet both prevented the other from the full enjoyment of\nlife. But it was the blue-blooded patrician who at last gave in and\nsecretly asked for an interview.\n\nThe conference was held on a fallen log on the shore of Porter's Pond in\nPike County, Pa. Someone said that if Mark Hopkins sat on one end of a\nlog and a student on the other end, it was a University; but, with\nWillowby on one end of the log and the Old Man on the other, it became\nnothing more than a conspiracy against the existence and the very life\nof the nation.\n\nIt was a strange sight, those two opposites on the log. The rich man, a\nlittle over five feet, barely a hundred pounds, with the body of a boy\nand the face of an angel. At the other end a large man, with the torso\nof an ape, and the face of a Titan, a man who had conquered by crushing,\nruthlessly and devastatingly, all who had dared to oppose him. The two\nwere great men, but they were equally lonely. Their very positions as\nleaders of their respective societies prevented any fraternizing with\ntheir followers.\n\n\"I do not want to waste your time, Mr. Consuelo,\" began Willowby. \"We\nought to be able to understand each other. You would do nicely if the\nFederal Government would leave you alone, but it has the peculiar\nability of annoying you and interfering with your plans. Am I right?\"\n\n\"Absolutely! Of course, it does not make any real difference--\"\n\n\"But it does annoy you--investigations of your income tax and deporting\nyour men now and then?\"\n\n\"Well, what of it?\"\n\n\"Simply this. After some years of effort, I am at last able to say that\nI control the Government.\"\n\n\"That is the silly brag of a child,\" sneered the Old Man.\n\n\"Not at all,\" and as he said that, Willowby reached down and picked up a\nhandful of pebbles. \"See these stones? In the same way I hold in my hand\na majority of the Supreme Court, over two-thirds of the Senators and\nmost of the Representatives. I can swing the votes of enough of the\nstates to pass any kind of legislation I wish. Now here is my\nproposition. You handle the cities. I will turn over the country to you.\nTogether we will run the nation, and all I want is just one thing--just\none little favor from you.\"\n\n\"I bet I can guess what that is,\" laughed the Old Man.\n\n\"No doubt, but let me tell you. I want to be the next President.\"\n\n\"I thought so.\"\n\n\"I think we ought to be together on this thing. Perhaps I could be\nelected without your help, even in spite of your opposition. But if I\nam, I will, naturally, try to destroy you. We might end up like the\nKilkenny cats. But if we are allies, I have eight years of power and you\nhave eight years of liberty in which to plunder the richest nation in\nthe world. How about it?\"\n\nThe Old Man drew a deep breath.\n\n\"Is this on the level?\"\n\n\"It has to be. I have a reputation, and it is respectable. I am placing\nmyself in your hands. What is there to prevent you from giving the press\nan interview tomorrow?\"\n\n\"You would deny it!\"\n\n\"But no one would listen to me.\"\n\n\"I suppose not. What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"I want you to give the order to your leaders. There are a hundred of\nthem, perhaps a few more. No doubt my list is not absolutely accurate.\nCall them in, from Chicago, St. Louis, New Orleans, Boston and\nPhiladelphia. Have them all in one room. You introduce me. Let me talk\nto them. I will open the war chest, fifty million to start with, and\nmore to come. You promise them anything you want, and I will make the\npromise good.\"\n\n\"And you will be there? Right in the room with me?\"\n\n\"I will be there.\"\n\n\"I won't do it!\" growled the Old Man. \"I never have and I never will. I\ndon't do things that way. A whisper to one or two, and the business is\ndone, but not a hundred at one time. Some of these boys have never seen\nme.\"\n\n\"Then you want to turn me down?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, but I am opposed to that meeting.\"\n\n\"Then we are through talking. I will take you to the five-ten train, or,\nif you want to, I will have my chauffeur drive you to the city.\"\n\n\"Let's talk it over.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How about having six of the Big Boys there?\"\n\n\"No! All on my list or none.\"\n\n\"Your list?\"\n\n\"Certainly! I am not sure that it is absolutely correct, but it\nsatisfies me.\"\n\n\"Let me see it.\"\n\n\"No reason why you should not.\"\n\nThe Old Man took the paper that was handed to him. It was no casual\nglance, he gave the names. At last he handed it back to the little man\nwith the casual comment:\n\n\"I suppose that is not all you know about my organization?\"\n\n\"I suppose not. Why not be sensible about this, Mr. Consuelo? If we\nfight, we will simply kill each other, but if we become allies who can\nstop us? But I must be sure of you, and the only way I can be sure is to\nhave you talk to your men, and then let me talk to them. We can have the\nmeeting at night in my offices, you know where, top floor of the Empire\nTrust. No one need be any the wiser. Half an hour, and all the men can\ngo back with the money in their pockets and the orders in their brains.\"\n\n\"O.K. When shall we meet?\"\n\n\"A month from today at ten P.M.\"\n\n\"Good. I'll give the orders, but I want the money, the fifty million. It\nis not much, but part of it will help keep the Big Boys in line. Some of\nthem won't like the idea very much.\"\n\n\"A little cash will influence them. Now, how about taking you back to\nthe city?\"\n\n\n\nWinifred Willowby made preparations for entertaining his one hundred\nguests. His largest office was transformed into an assembly room. Its\ninch-thick carpets, overstuffed chairs and mahogany trimmings gave it an\nair of luxuriant comfort. There were special chairs for the Big Boys and\ntwo very special chairs for the Old Man and the Host of the evening. A\nlarge picture frame, hanging on one wall, and carefully covered, gave a\nhint as to part of the evening's ceremony.\n\nThe Empire Trust belonged to Willowby. He had built it so that he could\nhave a private office on the top floor, the sixty-third from the ground.\nThe elevator reached this floor, but there were no steps. Many buildings\nsurpassed it in height, but none in the view that it gave of the city.\nThe guests who arrived first commented on the view and expanded their\nchests when they realized that they carried that city in their vest\npockets.\n\nAt last every chair was occupied. It was a peculiar gathering. It\nincluded judges, politicians, pseudo-business men, several lawyers and\neven the Mayor of one of the largest cities in the Mississippi Valley.\nFacing them, sat the Old Man and Willowby.\n\nOf the hundred men in the audience not one was at his ease. Most had\ncome because they were afraid to stay away. Many hoped that they would\nnot be recognized. The majority doubted the wisdom of such a meeting and\nfelt that the Old Man was slipping mentally. It was the first time that\nmany of them had even seen him. He was almost as much of an unknown to\nthem as the little man sitting next to him. A peculiar silence hung over\nthe assembly. More than one man fondled the handle of his automatic. No\none seemed to be sure of what was going to happen next. It was a\nfortunate thing that the meeting was held at night; with the audience\ncomposed of such men. A daylight gathering would have been impossible.\n\nThe Old Man and Willowby held a short whispered conference, and then the\nleader of American Racketeers stood up. What had been silence before,\nnow became the hush of death. The Old Man was going to talk, and\neveryone wanted to hear what he had to say. It did not take him long to\nstart.\n\n\"You Big Boys have been running the cities before,\" he growled, \"but\nfrom tonight on we are going to run the country. Congress and the\nSupreme Court are going to dance to our music and like it. Our new\nfriend here has promised to deliver the goods, and he does not want much\nin return. I have told him that we will trade, and what I say goes. Now,\nyou boys listen to Willowby, and remember that I am back of him.\"\n\nThen he sat down. As far as the records are concerned, that was the\nlongest speech the Old Man made in his life. The Boys hardly knew what\nto do; they felt they should applaud, but not being certain remained\nquiet. Then Willowby stood up.\n\n\"I do not want very much, gentlemen,\" he remarked. \"I only want to be\nthe next President of the United States, and I can be, with your help.\nLet me show you a picture.\"\n\nHe walked over to the covered picture, pulled a cord and unveiled it and\nthere, life size, were the Old Man and Willowby shaking hands. Anyone\ncould tell who they were and what they were doing. That brought the\nhouse down. Everybody felt that it was time for a little noise. Some of\nthem, who knew the Big Boy well enough, went up and congratulated him on\nthe new political alliance. In the confusion, Winifred Willowby slipped\nout of the room and no one noticed his absence.\n\nBut some one did notice the sideboard and started to sample the bottles.\nSoon everyone was drinking a little. But the Old Man did not drink. He\njust sat there, moodily chewing his cigar and wondering how much of the\nfifty million he could keep for his share.\n\nNobody saw the first rat. It dropped from behind the picture and ran\nunder a chair. The next rat did the same. Perhaps fifty rats were in the\nroom before their presence was noticed. By that time they were coming\nfaster, by the dozen, by the hundred. That was different. One rat in a\nlarge room meant nothing. A hundred, five hundred in the same room could\nmean almost anything.\n\nAnd now they were literally pouring out from back of the picture. A\ncursing man pulled it to the floor and there was a large hole in the\nwall, two feet in diameter, and out of that hole the rats were pouring,\nbig brown, hungry rats, dropping to the floor and starting to hunt for\nfood. The puzzled men jumped up on top the chairs; the rats stood on\ntheir hind legs and looked at the large chunks of food with black beady,\nbinoculars. The Old Man just sat there, chewing his cigar and cursing.\nHe knew what it all meant seconds before anyone else.\n\nA number of the most fearful men made a dash for the elevator. They were\ndriven back by a torrent of rats climbing up the elevator shaft. Then\n_fear came--and panic_. With gun and heel, and broken chairs for clubs,\nthey started in to kill rats, and for every one they killed, a hundred\nfastened to them with chisel teeth. To make it worse, the lights went\nout, and they were there in the dark, with mutilation as a beginning and\ndeath as an ending, and still the rats poured into the room, up the\nelevator shaft and out of the hole in the wall.\n\n\n\nThe Old Man walked across the room, kicking the struggling bodies of his\nfollowers out of his pathway. Rats ran up his legs and tried to bite his\nhands, his face; he swept them off him as a tiger would wipe ants off\nhis fur; at last he came to the window. There was the city of New York\nin front of him, the city of a million twinkling lights, the tomb of a\nbillion dead hopes; the Morgue of a Nation, covered by laughing, painted\nfaces. He raised the sash and sat on the sill.\n\n\"Damn Willowby!\" he said. \"What a fool I was. But I am going to die\nclean. No rat is going to send me to Hell!\"\n\nAnd then he dropped.\n\nIn the room the struggle kept on--for an hour and then two. At last the\nscreaming ceased, and the only sound was the gnawing of the rats, the\ncrunching of their teeth and their satisfied, little squeaks of\npleasure.\n\nThe next morning Winifred Willowby called on the Chief of the Secret\nService of New York. With him were several men from Washington.\n\n\"I want to tell you something,\" he said. \"A large group of men borrowed\nmy office to have a meeting last night. They wanted privacy and secrecy\nand they had heard of my place in the Empire Trust Building. So I loaned\nthem the entire floor for the night. But my janitors tell me that\nsomething terrible happened. An army of rats invaded the place, as they\nhave been doing with other places in the city, and literally ate every\nman there; that is, all except one, a fellow by the name of Consuelo,\nand he preferred to jump out of a window and die clean on the pavement.\"\n\n\"Consuelo?\" asked the Chief. \"Not the Old Man? Not _that_ Consuelo?\"\n\n\"I think that is the one. Here is a list of the men who were there. I\nthought you might like to look it over before you gave it to the\npapers.\"\n\nThe Chief took the list and read it, puzzled.\n\n\"Do you mean these men were there last night?\"\n\n\"I understand so.\"\n\n\"And now they are dead?\"\n\n\"I think so. Of course, that is for the coroner to say.\"\n\n\"Do you know who these men were?\"\n\n\"I suppose they were business associates of Consuelo. At least, that is\nwhat he told me.\"\n\n\"They were the hundred biggest gangsters in America. They were the\nbrains of everything vicious in American society. There is not a man\nthere whom we have not been after for years, but we just couldn't pin\nanything on them. Their death in one night gives the decent people in\nour country a new lease on life. We can go ahead now and get the little\nfellows. But, tell me, Mr. Willowby, how did it happen?\"\n\n\"I told you. They had a meeting and the rats came. You know there was a\nrat racket which no one thoroughly understood. Anyway, the rats\ncame--and killed them. No one can tell exactly what did happen, because\neveryone who was there was killed. That is all. I am sorry that it\nhappened in my office--but I thought I was doing the man a favor to loan\nhim the place for the meeting.\"\n\n\n\nThat night Crawford and Willowby were talking things over. In rushed\nRastell and Wilson, brushing the indignant butler aside.\n\n\"We have heard a thousand rumors,\" began Rastell, \"and read as many\nfoolish statements in the papers about the rat tragedy, and we just\ncouldn't wait a minute longer. You just have to tell us what happened.\nWe are not going to leave you till you do.\"\n\n\"You tell them, Crawford,\" whispered Willowby. \"Whenever I talk about\nit, my voice becomes squeaky.\"\n\n\"It happened this way,\" explained Crawford. \"After you started to work,\nMr. Willowby decided to go over and study the story of the Piper right\nin the town of Hamelin. We went there and there was no doubt that the\ntown people really believed that it really happened. They told us all\nabout it, and the more we listened and paid them, the more they told.\nThey gave us the very tune the Piper played to make the rats follow him.\nIt was a simple little thing, and we made some phonograph records of it.\nIt seems that when the rats hear that tune, they want to get as close as\nthey can to the source of the music. Then one old man--he gave us some\nadditional bars which he claimed drove the rats frantic for blood, and\nwe made a record of that also.\n\n\"Afterwards we came back to America and went up into Pike County. Not so\nmany rats there but enough to experiment with. We tried the short tune\nand the long tune and they worked on the American rats just like they\ndid on the Hamelin ones. We put two and two together and decided that\nthe rat racketeers in New York were using this method of attracting\nrats. Just put a repeating phonograph in a building and start it\nplaying, and then the rats would come and eat everything to pieces. Of\ncourse, we did not know the psychology of it, but I suppose it has\nsomething to do with the effect of musical vibrations on the rat's\nnervous system.\n\n\"Then Mr. Willowby thought that it would be a good idea to make a great\nrat trap and attract all the rats in the city to it. He had a good deal\nof work done in the Empire Trust, and rigged up a phonograph with a lot\nof loud speakers in different parts of the basement. He ran a lot of\nropes down a ventilating shaft for the rats to climb on. I think it was\nhis original idea to have them come up to his office by the millions and\nthen use some kind of gas on them. At least, he wanted to get rid of the\nrats. Someone must have turned on the phonograph with the entire record.\nMr. Willowby left the room, went down the elevator and being somewhat\nabsent-minded, told the elevator boy that he could go for the night. Of\ncourse, he was surprised to hear all about it the next morning. All he\nwanted to do was to get rid of the rats.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" purred Mr. Winifred Willowby.\n\nAnd he lit another cigarette.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] When the magician (the Piper) had led the one hundred and thirty\nchildren out of the city, two hundred and seventy-two years before the\ngate was built.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
