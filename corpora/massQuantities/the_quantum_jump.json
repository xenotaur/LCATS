    "body": "Brandon was looking at the Milky Way. Through his perma-glas canopy, he\ncould see it trailing across the black velvet of space like a white\nbridal veil. Below his SC9B scout-ship stretched the red dust deserts of\nSirius Three illuminated by the thin light of two ice moons. He looked\nat the Milky Way.\n\nHe looked at it as a man looks at a flickering fireplace and thinks of\nother things. He thought of the sun, 52 trillion miles away, a pinpoint\nof light lost in the dazzle of the Milky Way--the Earth a speck of dust\nin orbit just as this planet was to its master, Sirius.\n\nNine light years away. Of course, thirteen years had passed on Earth\nsince they had left, because the trip took four years by RT--relative\ntime. But even four years is a long time to be shut up in Astro One with\nfive other men, especially when one of them was the imperious Colonel\nTowers.\n\n\n\"A quantum jump--that's the way to beat the Reds,\" the colonel had said\na thousand times. His well-worn expression had nothing to do with\nquantum mechanics--the actual change in atomic configuration due to the\napplication of sufficient energy. Rather, it was a slang expression\nreferring to a major advance in inter-planetary travel due to a maximum\nscientific and technological effort.\n\n\"Let 'em have Mars and Venus,\" the colonel would say--\"Let 'em have the\nwhole damn Solar System! We'll make a quantum jump--leap-frog ahead of\n'em. We'll be the first men to set foot on a planet of another solar\nsystem.\"\n\nFour years had gone by in the ship; thirteen years on Earth. Four years\nof Colonel Towers. Military discipline grew more strict each day. Space\ndoes funny things to some men. The \"we'll be the first men\" had turned\ninto, \"_I'll_ be the first _man_.\"\n\nBut it was Captain Brandon who drew the assignment of scouting Sirius\nThree for a suitable landing place for Astro, of sampling its atmosphere\nand observing meteorological conditions. Even as Brandon climbed into\nthe scout-ship, Towers had cautioned him.\n\n\"Remember, your assignment is to locate a firm landing site with ample\nprotection from the elements. Under no circumstances are you to land\nyourself. Is that clearly understood?\"\n\nBrandon nodded, was launched and now was cruising one hundred thousand\nfeet above the alien planet.\n\nBrandon tilted the ship up on one wing and glanced down at the brick-red\nexpanse of desert. Tiny red mists marked dust storms. Certainly this was\nno place to set down the full weight of Astro nor to protect the crew\nand equipment from abrasive dust.\n\nHe righted the ship. Far on the horizon was a bank of atmospheric\nclouds. Perhaps conditions were more promising there. He shoved the\npower setting to 90 per cent.\n\nA fire warning indicator light blinked on. Instantly Brandon's eyes were\non the instrument panel. The tailpipe temperature seemed all right. It\ncould be a false indication. He eased back on the power setting. Maybe\nthe light would go out. But it didn't. Instead he felt a surging rumble\ndeep in the bowels of the ship. Luminous needles danced and a second red\nlight flashed on.\n\nHe snapped the vidio switch and depressed the mike button.\n\n\"Astro One, this is Brandon. Over.\"\n\nA steady crackling sound filled his earphones; a grid of light and\nshadow fluttered on the screen. A thought entered his mind. Maybe he had\nput too much planet curvature between Astro and himself.\n\n\"Astro One, this is Brandon. Come in, please.\"\n\nA series of muffled explosions rocked the ship. He chopped the power\nback all the way and listened intently.\n\n\"May Day! May Day! Astro, this is Brandon. May Day!\"\n\n\nA faint voice sputtered in his ear, the face of Reinhardt, the radioman\nappeared before him. \"Brandon, this is Astro One. What is your position?\nOver.\"\n\nBrandon's voice sounded strange and distant as he talked to his oxygen\nmask. \"Heading--one-eight-zero. Approximately six hundred miles from\nyou. Altitude one hundred thousand feet.\"\n\n\"What is the nature of your trouble, Brandon?\"\n\nBefore Brandon could answer, the face of Colonel Towers appeared beside\nthe radioman's.\n\n\"Brandon, what're you trying to pull?\"\n\n\"Engine trouble, sir. Losing altitude fast.\"\n\n\"Do you know the nature of the trouble?\"\n\n\"Negative. Might have thrown a compressor blade. Got a fire indication,\nthen a compressor surge. Chopped off the power.\"\n\nTowers frowned. \"Why didn't you use straight rocket power?\"\n\n\"Well, sir--\"\n\n\"Never mind now. You may have encountered oxygen or hydrogen-rich\natmosphere--melted your compressor blades. Try an air start on straight\nrocket. I want that ship back, Brandon. Repeat, I want that ship back!\"\n\n\"I may be able to ride it down. Get it on the deck intact.\"\n\n\"Try an air start, Brandon.\" Towers leaned forward, his eyes fixed on\nBrandon. \"I don't want you to set foot on that planet, get me?\"\n\nBut there wasn't time to try anything. The cabin was filling with fumes.\nBrandon looked down. A fringe of blue flame crept along between the\nfloor and the bottom of the pilot's capsule. A cold ache filled the\ncavity of his stomach.\n\n\"Too late. I'm on fire! Capsuling out. Repeat, capsuling out.\"\n\n\"Brandon--!\"\n\nThe colonel's glaring face flicked off as Brandon pushed the\npre-ejection lever into the lock position severing all connections\nbetween the ship and the pilot's capsule. Brandon had a strange,\ndetached feeling as he pushed the ejection button.\n\nThere was an explosion and the pilot's capsule shot up like a wet bar of\nsoap squeezed out of a giant's hand.\n\nThe ship turned into a torch and sank beneath him. Brandon closed his\neyes for a moment.\n\nWhen he opened them he was staring at the Milky Way, then the desert as\nhe tumbled over and over. He talked to the Milky Way.\n\n\"Ten seconds. Should wait at least ten seconds before releasing the\ndrogue chute so I'll clear the ship.\" Then he spoke to the desert. \"And\nmaybe another ten to give the capsule time to slow down.\"\n\nHe counted then pulled the chute release. Nylon streamed out behind him\nand snapped open with a tremendous jar. A moment later, bundles of metal\nribbons floated out and billowed into a giant umbrella. The last thing\nhe remembered was the taste of blood on his lips.\n\n\nWhen Brandon opened his eyes he was staring at the silvery disks of the\ntwin moons. They were high in the sky, obscuring the center of the Milky\nWay. Funny he should be lying on his back looking at the sky, he\nthought. Then he remembered.\n\nThe capsule was on its back and Brandon was still strapped securely to\nthe seat. His whole body ached. Tendons had been pulled, muscles\nstrained from the force of the ejection. His oxygen mask was still in\nplace, but his helmet hung partly loose. He adjusted it automatically,\nthen unbuckled the seat straps. He took a deep breath. Under the oxygen\nmask, he was aware of dried blood clotted in his nostrils, caked around\nthe corners of his lips.\n\nWith an effort he sat up on the seat back and looked through the\nperma-glas. A tangle of cords stretched out to the nylon of the main\nchute draped over a dust dune. Beyond it he could see the gleaming metal\nribbons of the drogue chute.\n\nAhead of him, behind some low hills, he could see a dull red glow. The\nship, he thought. Astro may already be hovering over it.\n\nHe dragged the survival kit from behind the seat and pulled out some\nrations, a first-aid kit, finally a tele-talkie. Raising the antenna, he\nplugged in the mike cord from his mask and held down the \"talk\" key with\nhis thumb.\n\n\"Astro One, this is Brandon. Come in.\"\n\nAs he talked a picture flickered on the screen. It was the radio room on\nAstro One. Colonel Towers was pacing back and forth in front of the\nradioman.\n\n\"Shall I keep trying to raise him?\" he heard Reinhardt ask.\n\n\"Damn fool stunt,\" Towers sputtered. \"Know what I think? I think he went\ndown deliberately. Just to be the first human being to walk the ground\nof a planet of another solar system.\"\n\n\"Astro, this is Brandon. Come in please.\"\n\nTowers continued to pace and talk. \"He did it to spite me.\"\n\n\"But we can't raise him sir,\" the radio operator said. \"Maybe he didn't\nget out of it alive.\"\n\n\"Colonel Towers, can't you hear me?\" Brandon yelled into his oxygen\nmask.\n\n\"He got out all right,\" the colonel said. \"He's just stalling to make it\nlook good.\"\n\n\"We aren't going to give up the search are we, sir?\" asked the radioman.\n\n\"It would serve his soul right.\" The colonel stopped pacing and faced\nthe radioman. \"Keep trying to raise him, Reinhardt. I'm going to bring\nus down to forty thousand feet and search the area where he went down.\nHelluva waste of rocket fuel tooling around in the atmosphere,\" he\nmuttered, disappearing through a bulkhead door.\n\n\n\"Wait! Colonel Towers!\" Brandon called. But he knew it was no use.\nObviously he could pick up Astro but they could neither see nor hear\nhim.\n\n\"Captain Brandon, this is Astro calling. Over.\" The radioman repeated\nthe phrase a dozen times and each time Brandon acknowledged, swore and\nacknowledged again. Finally, in desperation, he switched off the\ntele-talkie.\n\nHe snapped open the back of the unit and studied the maze of\ntransistors, resistors, and capacitators. If there was something wrong\nit was subtle, like a burned out resistor or a shorted condenser.\nWhatever it was, it was beyond emergency repair. He dropped the\ntele-talkie behind the seat and examined the gauge on his oxygen tank.\nThere was enough to last the night but not much more.\n\nHe sat down in the capsule to think. The first thing they'd locate is\nthe burning ship, he decided. Then they would probably start searching\nin ever-widening circles. But would they see him in the faint light of\nthe ice moons?\n\nHe looked back at the nylon chute again. Another thought ran through his\nmind. Suppose they don't spot me in the dark. When the sun--Sirius, I\nmean--comes up, there's a good chance they'll spot the parachute and\nsearch for him.\n\nHe slid the canopy open and looked down at the red soil of Sirius Three.\nHe hesitated for a moment, then swung his feet over the side and dropped\nto the ground.\n\n\"At least I'll have that satisfaction,\" he said, grinning under his\noxygen mask.\n\nVery much aware of gravity after years of weightlessness, he walked to\nthe canopy of the chute and spread it out on the flat ground in a full\ncircle. It billowed in the wind. He searched around, found some glassy\nblack rocks and anchored down the chute.\n\nThen he looked at the orange glow that marked the funeral pyre of the\nship. He had a decision to make; stay here with the capsule or head for\nthe fire.\n\nCouldn't be more than a thousand yards away, he decided. Charging a\nwalk-around oxygen bottle, he transferred his oxygen hose to it. He\nsnapped the survival kit to his belt and picked up the tele-talkie.\n\nThe ship was more than a thousand yards away. The first mile was across\nflat desert. He picked his way cautiously, his boots churning up clouds\nof powdery dust. He remembered the Russian reports of the weird and\ndeadly creatures they had encountered in the Martian deserts.\n\nBut aside from a few gray patches of brush there seemed to be no sign of\nlife. After all, he thought, the Earth held no life for the better part\nof its existence. And Towers had selected this planet because it bore\nrelatively the same relationship to the brighter, hotter Sirius as did\nthe Earth to the sun. While farther away it should have approximately\nthe same conditions as did the Earth. And it had seas, not as large as\non Earth, but seas, nevertheless.\n\n\nYet there was a fallacy in the argument. Presumably all of the stars in\nthe outer arms of the Milky Way and their planets were about the same\nage. With similar conditions as the Earth, life must have been born and\nwalked out of the seas of Sirius Three just as it did on Earth.\n\nSomething scurried into a wisp of brush, as if to bear out Brandon's\nrealization. He froze, his eyes on the brush, his hand reaching for his\nhydro-static shock pistol. He could hear nothing but the wind hollowing\nhis ears. He stood for a long moment, then cautiously skirted the brush,\nand continued on toward the burning ship. There was an odd clicking\nsound and he stopped. It sounded again. Brandon realized he was\nperspiring despite the chill of the desert night. Again he moved on, the\nsound fading in the distance behind him.\n\nThe next mile brought him to a great sheet of ancient lava laid bare by\nthe elements. He climbed to the top. The fire still seemed to be about a\nthousand yards ahead, beyond a ridge of low hills.\n\nA distant flare lit up the sky ahead of him. It glowed for a few moments\nand died. They've found the ship, he thought. After four years, I had\ncompletely forgotten about the store of photo-flash flares.\n\nHe watched for awhile but saw no more flares. Finally he scrambled down\nthe other side of the lava sheet and continued on toward the wreck,\nmoving slowly but steadily.\n\nThe third mile brought him to the scene of the crash. A smoking cylinder\nof fused metal lay in a gully. Parts were strewn along the bottom. A\nwing, untouched by the fire, was leaning tip down against the edge of\nanother lava sheet some distance away.\n\nHe sat down. Another flare flashed in the sky behind him silhouetting a\nrow of grotesque trees. I'm over here, you fools, he thought. He watched\nuntil the flare flickered out, then turned his head back toward the\nremains of the ship. There wasn't much of a glow to it now. It would be\nhard to see unless Astro was right on top of it.\n\nHe raised the antenna on the tele-talkie and snapped it on. The screen\nglowed into life. Towers was stepping through the bulkhead door into the\nradio room. Just like a television play in installments, Brandon\nthought. Scene two coming up.\n\n\"No sign of him at the scene of the crash,\" Towers told Reinhardt.\n\n\"If he got out,\" observed Reinhardt, \"he could be a hundred miles away\nor more.\"\n\n\"_If_ he got out,\" Towers said in a tone that irritated Brandon.\n\n\"I got out,\" Brandon said. \"And right now I'm walking around your\nprecious planet like a boy scout. Damn this tele-talkie! I'd give a\nyear's pay if you could see me now, Towers.\"\n\n\"We may yet spot the escape capsule,\" Reinhardt was saying.\n\n\"We're still continuing the search,\" put in Towers. \"But I don't mind\ntelling you I'm not wasting much more fuel.\"\n\nThe radio operator started to say something, hesitated and finally\nsettled for, \"yes, sir.\"\n\nBrandon swore and snapped off the set. He looked at his walk-around\nbottle.\n\n\"Can't stay here any longer,\" he muttered.\n\n\nHe couldn't find the capsule. He walked three, perhaps four miles. He\nstopped and blotted his moist brow with his sleeve. He wasn't going to\nfind it. Before him stretched an endless carpet of red dust. The light\nfrom the two moons was growing dim, as each settled toward different\nhorizons.\n\nHe sat down. A cloud of powdery dust settled over his legs. The\nlightness in his head told him that his oxygen was running out. The\nweakness in his muscles reminded him that it had been a long time since\nhe had walked in a planet's gravity. A distant flare lit up the horizon.\nHe choked off a sob, and beat his fist in the red dust. A wave of nausea\nswept over him. Bitter stomach juices welled up in his throat but he\nswallowed them down again.\n\nDesperately he turned on the tele-talkie.\n\n\"Astro, this is Brandon,\" he said.\n\n\"Brandon, this is Astro,\" Reinhardt said.\n\nBrandon's body tensed. \"Thank God I finally got through to you. Listen,\nReinhardt, I must be about three--\"\n\n\"Brandon, this is Astro,\" said Reinhardt in a monotone. He said it again\nand again and again.\n\nBrandon fell back on the ground. His breathing was short, strained. His\nface was bathed in perspiration. The oxygen, he realized, was giving\nout.\n\nWhat are the odds, that the air of Sirius Three is breathable, he\nwondered. One in a hundred? The planet has water and both animal and\nplant life. Certainly it has sufficient gravity to hold its oxygen. But\nwhat other elements--noxious gases might be present. Maybe the odds are\ncloser to one in fifty, he decided.\n\n\"But it's no gamble when you have nothing to lose,\" he told the Milky\nWay.\n\nRipping off his oxygen mask, he took a deep breath of the alien\natmosphere. The dust choked him, his ears rang. Black spots danced\nbefore his eyes, then melted into solid blackness.\n\n\nBrandon could hear Towers' voice in a vortex of darkness.\n\n\"Let's face it--Brandon is dead. Must have burned with the ship, at\nleast that's the way the report will read. Get me, Reinhardt?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the disembodied voice of Reinhardt replied quietly.\n\n\"We're going to set her down on a solid piece of ground near one of the\noceans.\" There was a pause and Brandon could almost see Colonel Towers\ndrawing up to his full height. \"I'm going to be the first man to set\nfoot on a planet of another solar system. Know what that means,\nReinhardt?\"\n\n\"A quantum jump sir?\"\n\n\"Right. Leap-frogging ahead of the Reds. Wait till they read the name\nColonel John Towers--maybe _General_ John Towers--_General_.\"\n\nBrandon opened his eyes. Sirius was turning the sky to gray, trimming a\nfew scattered clouds with gold. As he stared at the sky, Sirius rose\nwith a brassy glare. Near it he could see its white hot dwarf star\ncompanion. It was going to be a real scorcher, he decided; worse than\nany desert on Earth. He sat up stiffly.\n\nOn the tele-talkie screen, Reinhardt, alone in the radio room, was\ncalling quietly for Brandon. The bulkhead door swung open and Towers\npoked his head through.\n\n\"Knock that off,\" said Towers sternly, \"and take your landing station.\"\nAs Reinhardt rose to his feet, Brandon reached over and turned off the\nset.\n\nBrandon took a deep breath. His head spun and for the first time he\nrealized that he was still alive. He gazed across the shimmering desert\nto a ridge of scrubby hills. Blue mountains rose up beyond them. Great\nfloes of black lava had rolled down onto the desert floor at some\ndistant time. They were spotted with clumps of gray grass even as was\nthe desert. The hills were studded with weird trees standing stiff,\nbranches outstretched, like an army of scarecrows.\n\nThe air of Sirius Three was doing strange things to him. Two of the\ntrees seemed to be moving. He swayed and sat heavily.\n\n\nAs he watched through a haze of red dust whipped up by the morning\nbreeze, the two trees came closer, turned into men wearing desert\nuniforms and leaned over him.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" one of them asked.\n\nBrandon said nothing.\n\n\"We saw you from our observation station over on the hill,\" said the\nother pointing.\n\nThey helped Brandon to his feet and gave him a swig of cool, sweet water\nfrom a canteen.\n\n\"I'm Captain Brandon, of the Astro One.\"\n\n\"Astro One?\" The man removed his pith helmet to wipe his brow and\nBrandon noticed the gleaming US insignia on the front of the helmet.\n\"The Astro One left Earth thirteen years ago,\" the man said.\n\n\"Only four years by RT,\" Brandon said.\n\nThe man smiled and put his helmet back on his head. \"A lot of things\nhave happened since you left. There was a war which we won, and I guess\nyou guys were almost forgotten. And there was a lot of technological\ndevelopment.\"\n\n\"You mean you had a quantum jump?\" asked Brandon parroting Colonel\nTowers' favorite expression.\n\n\"Odd you would know that,\" replied the second man. \"It was through\nquantum mechanics that we learned to approximate the speed of light.\nWhile nine years pass on Earth when we make the trip, our RT is mere\nmoments.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" Brandon said. \"You must have passed us up.\"\n\n\"Been on this planet for nearly a year,\" the first man said. \"Got men on\ndozens of planetary systems throughout the Milky Way. One ship went a\nthousand light years out. By the time they come back, civilization on\nEarth will be two thousand years older.\"\n\n\"Have you got a tele-talkie?\" Brandon asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" said the first man, producing a set one-third the size of\nBrandon's.\n\n\"Could you tune it to 28.6 microcycles?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the man said again. He turned a dial with his thumb and handed\nthe unit to Brandon. Brandon depressed the \"talk\" button. A crystal\nclear image of Colonel Towers, putting the finishing touches on his full\ndress uniform, appeared on the screen.\n\n\"This is an historic occasion,\" Colonel Towers was announcing to his\ncrew. \"Open the hatch--and, Reinhardt, be sure to stand by with the\nmotion picture camera.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Colonel Towers,\" said Brandon quietly.\n\nTowers swung around and looked out at Brandon. The colonel's face paled.\n\n\"I have something to tell you,\" said Brandon grinning, \"about the\nquantum jump.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n",
