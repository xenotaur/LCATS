It was told\nto me many years ago by the late Miss Anna Seward, who, among other\naccomplishments that rendered her an amusing inmate in a country house,\nhad that of recounting narratives of this sort with very considerable\neffect--much greater, indeed, than any one would be apt to guess from\nthe style of her written performances. There are hours and moods when\nmost people are not displeased to listen to such things; and I have\nheard some of the greatest and wisest of my contemporaries take their\nshare in telling them.\n\nAUGUST 1831\n\n\n\n\nTHE TAPESTRIED CHAMBER;\n\nOR,\n\nTHE LADY IN THE SACQUE.\n\nThe following narrative is given from the pen, so far as memory permits,\nin the same character in which it was presented to the author\u2019s ear; nor\nhas he claim to further praise, or to be more deeply censured, than\nin proportion to the good or bad judgment which he has employed in\nselecting his materials, as he has studiously avoided any attempt at\nornament which might interfere with the simplicity of the tale.\n\nAt the same time, it must be admitted that the particular class of\nstories which turns on the marvellous possesses a stronger influence\nwhen told than when committed to print. The volume taken up at noonday,\nthough rehearsing the same incidents, conveys a much more feeble\nimpression than is achieved by the voice of the speaker on a circle of\nfireside auditors, who hang upon the narrative as the narrator details\nthe minute incidents which serve to give it authenticity, and lowers his\nvoice with an affectation of mystery while he approaches the fearful\nand wonderful part. It was with such advantages that the present writer\nheard the following events related, more than twenty years since, by\nthe celebrated Miss Seward of Litchfield, who, to her numerous\naccomplishments, added, in a remarkable degree, the power of narrative\nin private conversation. In its present form the tale must necessarily\nlose all the interest which was attached to it by the flexible voice and\nintelligent features of the gifted narrator. Yet still, read aloud to an\nundoubting audience by the doubtful light of the closing evening, or in\nsilence by a decaying taper, and amidst the solitude of a half-lighted\napartment, it may redeem its character as a good ghost story. Miss\nSeward always affirmed that she had derived her information from an\nauthentic source, although she suppressed the names of the two persons\nchiefly concerned. I will not avail myself of any particulars I may have\nsince received concerning the localities of the detail, but suffer them\nto rest under the same general description in which they were first\nrelated to me; and for the same reason I will not add to or diminish the\nnarrative by any circumstance, whether more or less material, but simply\nrehearse, as I heard it, a story of supernatural terror.\n\nAbout the end of the American war, when the officers of Lord\nCornwallis\u2019s army, which surrendered at Yorktown, and others, who had\nbeen made prisoners during the impolitic and ill-fated controversy, were\nreturning to their own country, to relate their adventures, and repose\nthemselves after their fatigues, there was amongst them a general\nofficer, to whom Miss S. gave the name of Browne, but merely, as I\nunderstood, to save the inconvenience of introducing a nameless agent\nin the narrative. He was an officer of merit, as well as a gentleman of\nhigh consideration for family and attainments.\n\nSome business had carried General Browne upon a tour through the western\ncounties, when, in the conclusion of a morning stage, he found himself\nin the vicinity of a small country town, which presented a scene of\nuncommon beauty, and of a character peculiarly English.\n\nThe little town, with its stately old church, whose tower bore testimony\nto the devotion of ages long past, lay amidst pastures and cornfields of\nsmall extent, but bounded and divided with hedgerow timber of great age\nand size. There were few marks of modern improvement. The environs of\nthe place intimated neither the solitude of decay nor the bustle of\nnovelty; the houses were old, but in good repair; and the beautiful\nlittle river murmured freely on its way to the left of the town, neither\nrestrained by a dam nor bordered by a towing-path.\n\nUpon a gentle eminence, nearly a mile to the southward of the town, were\nseen, amongst many venerable oaks and tangled thickets, the turrets of\na castle as old as the walls of York and Lancaster, but which seemed to\nhave received important alterations during the age of Elizabeth and\nher successor, It had not been a place of great size; but whatever\naccommodation it formerly afforded was, it must be supposed, still to\nbe obtained within its walls. At least, such was the inference which\nGeneral Browne drew from observing the smoke arise merrily from several\nof the ancient wreathed and carved chimney-stalks. The wall of the park\nran alongside of the highway for two or three hundred yards; and through\nthe different points by which the eye found glimpses into the woodland\nscenery, it seemed to be well stocked. Other points of view opened in\nsuccession--now a full one of the front of the old castle, and now\na side glimpse at its particular towers, the former rich in all the\nbizarrerie of the Elizabethan school, while the simple and solid\nstrength of other parts of the building seemed to show that they had\nbeen raised more for defence than ostentation.\n\nDelighted with the partial glimpses which he obtained of the castle\nthrough the woods and glades by which this ancient feudal fortress was\nsurrounded, our military traveller was determined to inquire whether\nit might not deserve a nearer view, and whether it contained family\npictures or other objects of curiosity worthy of a stranger\u2019s visit,\nwhen, leaving the vicinity of the park, he rolled through a clean and\nwell-paved street, and stopped at the door of a well-frequented inn.\n\nBefore ordering horses, to proceed on his journey, General Browne\nmade inquiries concerning the proprietor of the chateau which had so\nattracted his admiration, and was equally surprised and pleased at\nhearing in reply a nobleman named, whom we shall call Lord Woodville.\nHow fortunate! Much of Browne\u2019s early recollections, both at school\nand at college, had been connected with young Woodville, whom, by a few\nquestions, he now ascertained to be the same with the owner of this fair\ndomain. He had been raised to the peerage by the decease of his father\na few months before, and, as the General learned from the landlord, the\nterm of mourning being ended, was now taking possession of his paternal\nestate in the jovial season of merry, autumn, accompanied by a select\nparty of friends, to enjoy the sports of a country famous for game.\n\nThis was delightful news to our traveller. Frank Woodville had been\nRichard Browne\u2019s fag at Eton, and his chosen intimate at Christ Church;\ntheir pleasures and their tasks had been the same; and the honest\nsoldier\u2019s heart warmed to find his early friend in possession of so\ndelightful a residence, and of an estate, as the landlord assured\nhim with a nod and a wink, fully adequate to maintain and add to his\ndignity. Nothing was more natural than that the traveller should suspend\na journey, which there was nothing to render hurried, to pay a visit to\nan old friend under such agreeable circumstances.\n\nThe fresh horses, therefore, had only the brief task of conveying the\nGeneral\u2019s travelling carriage to Woodville Castle. A porter admitted\nthem at a modern Gothic lodge, built in that style to correspond with\nthe castle itself, and at the same time rang a bell to give warning of\nthe approach of visitors. Apparently the sound of the bell had suspended\nthe separation of the company, bent on the various amusements of the\nmorning; for, on entering the court of the chateau, several young\nmen were lounging about in their sporting dresses, looking at and\ncriticizing the dogs which the keepers held in readiness to attend their\npastime. As General Browne alighted, the young lord came to the gate\nof the hall, and for an instant gazed, as at a stranger, upon the\ncountenance of his friend, on which war, with its fatigues and its\nwounds, had made a great alteration. But the uncertainty lasted no\nlonger than till the visitor had spoken, and the hearty greeting which\nfollowed was such as can only be exchanged betwixt those who have passed\ntogether the merry days of careless boyhood or early youth.\n\n\u201cIf I could have formed a wish, my dear Browne,\u201d said Lord Woodville,\n\u201cit would have been to have you here, of all men, upon this occasion,\nwhich my friends are good enough to hold as a sort of holiday. Do not\nthink you have been unwatched during the years you have been absent\nfrom us. I have traced you through your dangers, your triumphs, your\nmisfortunes, and was delighted to see that, whether in victory or\ndefeat, the name of my old friend was always distinguished with\napplause.\u201d\n\nThe General made a suitable reply, and congratulated his friend on his\nnew dignities, and the possession of a place and domain so beautiful.\n\n\u201cNay, you have seen nothing of it as yet,\u201d said Lord Woodville, \u201cand I\ntrust you do not mean to leave us till you are better acquainted with\nit. It is true, I confess, that my present party is pretty large, and\nthe old house, like other places of the kind, does not possess so much\naccommodation as the extent of the outward walls appears to promise.\nBut we can give you a comfortable old-fashioned room, and I venture\nto suppose that your campaigns have taught you to be glad of worse\nquarters.\u201d\n\nThe General shrugged his shoulders, and laughed. \u201cI presume,\u201d he said,\n\u201cthe worst apartment in your chateau is considerably superior to the old\ntobacco-cask in which I was fain to take up my night\u2019s lodging when I\nwas in the Bush, as the Virginians call it, with the light corps. There\nI lay, like Diogenes himself, so delighted with my covering from the\nelements, that I made a vain attempt to have it rolled on to my next\nquarters; but my commander for the time would give way to no such\nluxurious provision, and I took farewell of my beloved cask with tears\nin my eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, since you do not fear your quarters,\u201d said Lord Woodville,\n\u201cyou will stay with me a week at least. Of guns, dogs, fishing-rods,\nflies, and means of sport by sea and land, we have enough and to\nspare--you cannot pitch on an amusement but we will find the means of\npursuing it. But if you prefer the gun and pointers, I will go with you\nmyself, and see whether you have mended your shooting since you have\nbeen amongst the Indians of the back settlements.\u201d\n\nThe General gladly accepted his friendly host\u2019s proposal in all its\npoints. After a morning of manly exercise, the company met at dinner,\nwhere it was the delight of Lord Woodville to conduce to the display of\nthe high properties of his recovered friend, so as to recommend him to\nhis guests, most of whom were persons of distinction. He led General\nBrowne to speak of the scenes he had witnessed; and as every word marked\nalike the brave officer and the sensible man, who retained possession\nof his cool judgment under the most imminent dangers, the company looked\nupon the soldier with general respect, as on one who had proved himself\npossessed of an uncommon portion of personal courage--that attribute of\nall others of which everybody desires to be thought possessed.\n\nThe day at Woodville Castle ended as usual in such mansions. The\nhospitality stopped within the limits of good order. Music, in which the\nyoung lord was a proficient, succeeded to the circulation of the bottle;\ncards and billiards, for those who preferred such amusements, were in\nreadiness; but the exercise of the morning required early hours, and not\nlong after eleven o\u2019clock the guests began to retire to their several\napartments.\n\nThe young lord himself conducted his friend, General Browne, to the\nchamber destined for him, which answered the description he had given\nof it, being comfortable, but old-fashioned, The bed was of the massive\nform used in the end of the seventeenth century, and the curtains of\nfaded silk, heavily trimmed with tarnished gold. But then the sheets,\npillows, and blankets looked delightful to the campaigner, when he\nthought of his \u201cmansion, the cask.\u201d There was an air of gloom in the\ntapestry hangings, which, with their worn-out graces, curtained the\nwalls of the little chamber, and gently undulated as the autumnal breeze\nfound its way through the ancient lattice window, which pattered and\nwhistled as the air gained entrance. The toilet, too, with its mirror,\nturbaned after the manner of the beginning of the century, with a\ncoiffure of murrey-coloured silk, and its hundred strange-shaped boxes,\nproviding for arrangements which had been obsolete for more than fifty\nyears, had an antique, and in so far a melancholy, aspect. But nothing\ncould blaze more brightly and cheerfully than the two large wax candles;\nor if aught could rival them, it was the flaming, bickering fagots in\nthe chimney, that sent at once their gleam and their warmth through\nthe snug apartment, which, notwithstanding the general antiquity of its\nappearance, was not wanting in the least convenience that modern habits\nrendered either necessary or desirable.\n\n\u201cThis is an old-fashioned sleeping apartment, General,\u201d said the\nyoung lord; \u201cbut I hope you find nothing that makes you envy your old\ntobacco-cask.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not particular respecting my lodgings,\u201d replied the General; \u201cyet\nwere I to make any choice, I would prefer this chamber by many degrees\nto the gayer and more modern rooms of your family mansion. Believe\nme that, when I unite its modern air of comfort with its venerable\nantiquity, and recollect that it is your lordship\u2019s property, I shall\nfeel in better quarters here than if I were in the best hotel London\ncould afford.\u201d\n\n\u201cI trust--I have no doubt--that you will find yourself as comfortable\nas I wish you, my dear General,\u201d said the young nobleman; and once more\nbidding his guest good-night, he shook him by the hand, and withdrew.\n\nThe General once more looked round him, and internally congratulating\nhimself on his return to peaceful life, the comforts of which were\nendeared by the recollection of the hardships and dangers he had lately\nsustained, undressed himself, and prepared for a luxurious night\u2019s rest.\n\nHere, contrary to the custom of this species of tale, we leave the\nGeneral in possession of his apartment until the next morning.\n\nThe company assembled for breakfast at an early hour, but without the\nappearance of General Browne, who seemed the guest that Lord Woodville\nwas desirous of honouring above all whom his hospitality had assembled\naround him. He more than once expressed surprise at the General\u2019s\nabsence, and at length sent a servant to make inquiry after him. The\nman brought back information that General Browne had been walking abroad\nsince an early hour of the morning, in defiance of the weather, which\nwas misty and ungenial.\n\n\u201cThe custom of a soldier,\u201d said the young nobleman to his friends. \u201cMany\nof them acquire habitual vigilance, and cannot sleep after the early\nhour at which their duty usually commands them to be alert.\u201d\n\nYet the explanation which Lord Woodville thus offered to the company\nseemed hardly satisfactory to his own mind, and it was in a fit of\nsilence and abstraction that he waited the return of the General. It\ntook place near an hour after the breakfast bell had rung. He looked\nfatigued and feverish. His hair, the powdering and arrangement of which\nwas at this time one of the most important occupations of a man\u2019s whole\nday, and marked his fashion as much as in the present time the tying of\na cravat, or the want of one, was dishevelled, uncurled, void of\npowder, and dank with dew. His clothes were huddled on with a careless\nnegligence, remarkable in a military man, whose real or supposed duties\nare usually held to include some attention to the toilet; and his looks\nwere haggard and ghastly in a peculiar degree.\n\n\u201cSo you have stolen a march upon us this morning, my dear General,\u201d said\nLord Woodville; \u201cor you have not found your bed so much to your mind as\nI had hoped and you seemed to expect. How did you rest last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, excellently well! remarkably well! never better in my life,\u201d said\nGeneral Browne rapidly, and yet with an air of embarrassment which\nwas obvious to his friend. He then hastily swallowed a cup of tea, and\nneglecting or refusing whatever else was offered, seemed to fall into a\nfit of abstraction.\n\n\u201cYou will take the gun to-day, General?\u201d said his friend and host, but\nhad to repeat the question twice ere he received the abrupt answer, \u201cNo,\nmy lord; I am sorry I cannot have the opportunity of spending another\nday with your lordship; my post horses are ordered, and will be here\ndirectly.\u201d\n\nAll who were present showed surprise, and Lord Woodville immediately\nreplied \u201cPost horses, my good friend! What can you possibly want with\nthem when you promised to stay with me quietly for at least a week?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe,\u201d said the General, obviously much embarrassed, \u201cthat I\nmight, in the pleasure of my first meeting with your lordship, have\nsaid something about stopping here a few days; but I have since found it\naltogether impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is very extraordinary,\u201d answered the young nobleman. \u201cYou seemed\nquite disengaged yesterday, and you cannot have had a summons to-day,\nfor our post has not come up from the town, and therefore you cannot\nhave received any letters.\u201d\n\nGeneral Browne, without giving any further explanation, muttered\nsomething about indispensable business, and insisted on the absolute\nnecessity of his departure in a manner which silenced all opposition on\nthe part of his host, who saw that his resolution was taken, and forbore\nall further importunity.\n\n\u201cAt least, however,\u201d he said, \u201cpermit me, my dear Browne, since go you\nwill or must, to show you the view from the terrace, which the mist,\nthat is now rising, will soon display.\u201d\n\nHe threw open a sash-window, and stepped down upon the terrace as he\nspoke. The General followed him mechanically, but seemed little to\nattend to what his host was saying, as, looking across an extended\nand rich prospect, he pointed out the different objects worthy of\nobservation. Thus they moved on till Lord Woodville had attained\nhis purpose of drawing his guest entirely apart from the rest of the\ncompany, when, turning round upon him with an air of great solemnity, he\naddressed him thus:--\n\n\u201cRichard Browne, my old and very dear friend, we are now alone. Let me\nconjure you to answer me upon the word of a friend, and the honour of a\nsoldier. How did you in reality rest during last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cMost wretchedly indeed, my lord,\u201d answered the General, in the same\ntone of solemnity--\u201cso miserably, that I would not run the risk of such\na second night, not only for all the lands belonging to this castle, but\nfor all the country which I see from this elevated point of view.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is most extraordinary,\u201d said the young lord, as if speaking to\nhimself; \u201cthen there must be something in the reports concerning that\napartment.\u201d Again turning to the General, he said, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\nmy dear friend, be candid with me, and let me know the disagreeable\nparticulars which have befallen you under a roof, where, with consent of\nthe owner, you should have met nothing save comfort.\u201d\n\nThe General seemed distressed by this appeal, and paused a moment before\nhe replied. \u201cMy dear lord,\u201d he at length said, \u201cwhat happened to me last\nnight is of a nature so peculiar and so unpleasant, that I could hardly\nbring myself to detail it even to your lordship, were it not that,\nindependent of my wish to gratify any request of yours, I think that\nsincerity on my part may lead to some explanation about a circumstance\nequally painful and mysterious. To others, the communication I am about\nto make, might place me in the light of a weak-minded, superstitious\nfool, who suffered his own imagination to delude and bewilder him; but\nyou have known me in childhood and youth, and will not suspect me of\nhaving adopted in manhood the feelings and frailties from which my early\nyears were free.\u201d Here he paused, and his friend replied,--\n\n\u201cDo not doubt my perfect confidence in the truth of your communication,\nhowever strange it may be,\u201d replied Lord Woodville. \u201cI know your\nfirmness of disposition too well, to suspect you could be made the\nobject of imposition, and am aware that your honour and your friendship\nwill equally deter you from exaggerating whatever you may have\nwitnessed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d said the General, \u201cI will proceed with my story as well\nas I can, relying upon your candour, and yet distinctly feeling that\nI would rather face a battery than recall to my mind the odious\nrecollections of last night.\u201d\n\nHe paused a second time, and then perceiving that Lord Woodville\nremained silent and in an attitude of attention, he commenced, though\nnot without obvious reluctance, the history of his night\u2019s adventures in\nthe Tapestried Chamber.\n\n\u201cI undressed and went to bed so soon as your lordship left me yesterday\nevening; but the wood in the chimney, which nearly fronted my bed,\nblazed brightly and cheerfully, and, aided by a hundred exciting\nrecollections of my childhood and youth, which had been recalled by the\nunexpected pleasure of meeting your lordship, prevented me from falling\nimmediately asleep. I ought, however, to say that these reflections were\nall of a pleasant and agreeable kind, grounded on a sense of having for\na time exchanged the labour, fatigues, and dangers of my profession for\nthe enjoyments of a peaceful life, and the reunion of those friendly and\naffectionate ties which I had torn asunder at the rude summons of war.\n\n\u201cWhile such pleasing reflections were stealing over my mind, and\ngradually lulling me to slumber, I was suddenly aroused by a sound like\nthat of the rustling of a silken gown, and the tapping of a pair of\nhigh-heeled shoes, as if a woman were walking in the apartment. Ere\nI could draw the curtain to see what the matter was, the figure of a\nlittle woman passed between the bed and the fire. The back of this form\nwas turned to me, and I could observe, from the shoulders and neck, it\nwas that of an old woman, whose dress was an old-fashioned gown, which I\nthink ladies call a sacque--that is, a sort of robe completely loose in\nthe body, but gathered into broad plaits upon the neck and shoulders,\nwhich fall down to the ground, and terminate in a species of train.\n\n\u201cI thought the intrusion singular enough, but never harboured for a\nmoment the idea that what I saw was anything more than the mortal form\nof some old woman about the establishment, who had a fancy to dress like\nher grandmother, and who, having perhaps (as your lordship mentioned\nthat you were rather straitened for room) been dislodged from her\nchamber for my accommodation, had forgotten the circumstance, and\nreturned by twelve to her old haunt. Under this persuasion I moved\nmyself in bed and coughed a little, to make the intruder sensible of\nmy being in possession of the premises. She turned slowly round, but,\ngracious Heaven! my lord, what a countenance did she display to me!\nThere was no longer any question what she was, or any thought of her\nbeing a living being. Upon a face which wore the fixed features of a\ncorpse were imprinted the traces of the vilest and most hideous passions\nwhich had animated her while she lived. The body of some atrocious\ncriminal seemed to have been given up from the grave, and the soul\nrestored from the penal fire, in order to form for a space a union\nwith the ancient accomplice of its guilt. I started up in bed, and sat\nupright, supporting myself on my palms, as I gazed on this horrible\nspectre. The hag made, as it seemed, a single and swift stride to the\nbed where I lay, and squatted herself down upon it, in precisely the\nsame attitude which I had assumed in the extremity of horror, advancing\nher diabolical countenance within half a yard of mine, with a grin which\nseemed to intimate the malice and the derision of an incarnate fiend.\u201d\n\nHere General Browne stopped, and wiped from his brow the cold\nperspiration with which the recollection of his horrible vision had\ncovered it.\n\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d he said, \u201cI am no coward, I have been in all the mortal\ndangers incidental to my profession, and I may truly boast that no man\never knew Richard Browne dishonour the sword he wears; but in these\nhorrible circumstances, under the eyes, and, as it seemed, almost in the\ngrasp of an incarnation of an evil spirit, all firmness forsook me,\nall manhood melted from me like wax in the furnace, and I felt my hair\nindividually bristle. The current of my life-blood ceased to flow, and\nI sank back in a swoon, as very a victim to panic terror as ever was\na village girl, or a child of ten years old. How long I lay in this\ncondition I cannot pretend to guess.\n\n\u201cBut I was roused by the castle clock striking one, so loud that it\nseemed as if it were in the very room. It was some time before I dared\nopen my eyes, lest they should again encounter the horrible spectacle.\nWhen, however, I summoned courage to look up, she was no longer visible.\nMy first idea was to pull my bell, wake the servants, and remove to a\ngarret or a hay-loft, to be ensured against a second visitation. Nay, I\nwill confess the truth that my resolution was altered, not by the shame\nof exposing myself, but by the fear that, as the bell-cord hung by\nthe chimney, I might, in making my way to it, be again crossed by the\nfiendish hag, who, I figured to myself, might be still lurking about\nsome corner of the apartment.\n\n\u201cI will not pretend to describe what hot and cold fever-fits tormented\nme for the rest of the night, through broken sleep, weary vigils,\nand that dubious state which forms the neutral ground between them. A\nhundred terrible objects appeared to haunt me; but there was the great\ndifference betwixt the vision which I have described, and those which\nfollowed, that I knew the last to be deceptions of my own fancy and\nover-excited nerves.\n\n\u201cDay at last appeared, and I rose from my bed ill in health and\nhumiliated in mind. I was ashamed of myself as a man and a soldier,\nand still more so at feeling my own extreme desire to escape from the\nhaunted apartment, which, however, conquered all other considerations;\nso that, huddling on my clothes with the most careless haste, I made my\nescape from your lordship\u2019s mansion, to seek in the open air some relief\nto my nervous system, shaken as it was by this horrible rencounter with\na visitant, for such I must believe her, from the other world. Your\nlordship has now heard the cause of my discomposure, and of my sudden\ndesire to leave your hospitable castle. In other places I trust we may\noften meet, but God protect me from ever spending a second night under\nthat roof!\u201d\n\nStrange as the General\u2019s tale was, he spoke with such a deep air of\nconviction that it cut short all the usual commentaries which are made\non such stories. Lord Woodville never once asked him if he was sure he\ndid not dream of the apparition, or suggested any of the possibilities\nby which it is fashionable to explain supernatural appearances as\nwild vagaries of the fancy, or deceptions of the optic nerves, On the\ncontrary, he seemed deeply impressed with the truth and reality of\nwhat he had heard; and, after a considerable pause regretted, with much\nappearance of sincerity, that his early friend should in his house have\nsuffered so severely.\n\n\u201cI am the more sorry for your pain, my dear Browne,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat\nit is the unhappy, though most unexpected, result of an experiment of my\nown. You must know that, for my father and grandfather\u2019s time, at least,\nthe apartment which was assigned to you last night had been shut on\naccount of reports that it was disturbed by supernatural sights and\nnoises. When I came, a few weeks since, into possession of the estate,\nI thought the accommodation which the castle afforded for my friends was\nnot extensive enough to permit the inhabitants of the invisible world\nto retain possession of a comfortable sleeping apartment. I therefore\ncaused the Tapestried Chamber, as we call it, to be opened, and, without\ndestroying its air of antiquity, I had such new articles of furniture\nplaced in it as became the modern times. Yet, as the opinion that the\nroom was haunted very strongly prevailed among the domestics, and was\nalso known in the neighbourhood and to many of my friends, I feared some\nprejudice might be entertained by the first occupant of the Tapestried\nChamber, which might tend to revive the evil report which it had\nlaboured under, and so disappoint my purpose of rendering it a useful\npart or the house. I must confess, my dear Browne, that your arrival\nyesterday, agreeable to me for a thousand reasons besides, seemed the\nmost favourable opportunity of removing the unpleasant rumours which\nattached to the room, since your courage was indubitable, and your mind\nfree of any preoccupation on the subject. I could not, therefore, have\nchosen a more fitting subject for my experiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cUpon my life,\u201d said General Browne, somewhat hastily, \u201cI am infinitely\nobliged to your lordship--very particularly indebted indeed. I am likely\nto remember for some time the consequences of the experiment, as your\nlordship is pleased to call it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, now you are unjust, my dear friend,\u201d said Lord Woodville. \u201cYou\nhave only to reflect for a single moment, in order to be convinced that\nI could not augur the possibility of the pain to which you have been\nso unhappily exposed. I was yesterday morning a complete sceptic on the\nsubject of supernatural appearances. Nay, I am sure that, had I told\nyou what was said about that room, those very reports would have induced\nyou, by your own choice, to select it for your accommodation. It was my\nmisfortune, perhaps my error, but really cannot be termed my fault, that\nyou have been afflicted so strangely.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrangely indeed!\u201d said the General, resuming his good temper; \u201cand I\nacknowledge that I have no right to be offended with your lordship for\ntreating me like what I used to think myself--a man of some firmness\nand courage. But I see my post horses are arrived, and I must not detain\nyour lordship from your amusement.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, my old friend,\u201d said Lord Woodville, \u201csince you cannot stay with\nus another day--which, indeed, I can no longer urge--give me at least\nhalf an hour more. You used to love pictures, and I have a gallery of\nportraits, some of them by Vandyke, representing ancestry to whom this\nproperty and castle formerly belonged. I think that several of them will\nstrike you as possessing merit.\u201d\n\nGeneral Browne accepted the invitation, though somewhat unwillingly.\nIt was evident he was not to breathe freely or at ease till he left\nWoodville Castle far behind him. He could not refuse his friend\u2019s\ninvitation, however; and the less so, that he was a little ashamed\nof the peevishness which he had displayed towards his well-meaning\nentertainer.\n\nThe General, therefore, followed Lord Woodville through several rooms\ninto a long gallery hung with pictures, which the latter pointed out to\nhis guest, telling the names, and giving some account of the personages\nwhose portraits presented themselves in progression. General Browne was\nbut little interested in the details which these accounts conveyed to\nhim. They were, indeed, of the kind which are usually found in an old\nfamily gallery. Here was a Cavalier who had ruined the estate in the\nroyal cause; there a fine lady who had reinstated it by contracting a\nmatch with a wealthy Roundhead. There hung a gallant who had been in\ndanger for corresponding with the exiled Court at Saint Germain\u2019s; here\none who had taken arms for William at the Revolution; and there a third\nthat had thrown his weight alternately into the scale of Whig and Tory.\n\nWhile lord Woodville was cramming these words into his guest\u2019s ear,\n\u201cagainst the stomach of his sense,\u201d they gained the middle of the\ngallery, when he beheld General Browne suddenly start, and assume an\nattitude of the utmost surprise, not unmixed with fear, as his eyes were\nsuddenly caught and riveted by a portrait of an old lady in a sacque,\nthe fashionable dress of the end of the seventeenth century.\n\n\u201cThere she is!\u201d he exclaimed--\u201cthere she is, in form and features,\nthough Inferior in demoniac expression to the accursed hag who visited\nme last night!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that be the case,\u201d said the young nobleman, \u201cthere can remain no\nlonger any doubt of the horrible reality of your apparition. That is the\npicture of a wretched ancestress of mine, of whose crimes a black and\nfearful catalogue is recorded in a family history in my charter-chest.\nThe recital of them would be too horrible; it is enough to say, that in\nyon fatal apartment incest and unnatural murder were committed. I will\nrestore it to the solitude to which the better judgment of those who\npreceded me had consigned it; and never shall any one, so long as I can\nprevent it, be exposed to a repetition of the supernatural horrors which\ncould shake such courage as yours.\u201d\n\nThus the friends, who had met with such glee, parted in a very different\nmood--Lord Woodville to command the Tapestried Chamber to be unmantled,\nand the door built up; and General Browne to seek in some less beautiful\ncountry, and with some less dignified friend, forgetfulness of the\npainful night which he had passed in Woodville Castle.\n\nEND OF THE TAPESTRIED CHAMBER.\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\n\nDEATH OF THE LAIRD\u2019S JOCK\n\n\n[The manner in which this trifle was introduced at the time to Mr. F.\nM. Reynolds, editor of The Keepsake of 1828, leaves no occasion for a\npreface.]\n\nAUGUST 1831.\n\n\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE KEEPSAKE.\n\nYou have asked me, sir, to point out a subject for the pencil, and I\nfeel the difficulty of complying with your request, although I am not\ncertainly unaccustomed to literary composition, or a total stranger to\nthe stores of history and tradition, which afford the best copies for\nthe painter\u2019s art. But although SICUT PICTURA POESIS is an ancient and\nundisputed axiom--although poetry and painting both address themselves\nto the same object of exciting the human imagination, by presenting to\nit pleasing or sublime images of ideal scenes--yet the one conveying\nitself through the ears to the understanding, and the other applying\nitself only to the eyes, the subjects which are best suited to the bard\nor tale-teller are often totally unfit for painting, where the artist\nmust present in a single glance all that his art has power to tell us.\nThe artist can neither recapitulate the past nor intimate the future.\nThe single NOW is all which he can present; and hence, unquestionably,\nmany subjects which delight us in poetry or in narrative, whether real\nor fictitious, cannot with advantage be transferred to the canvas.\n\nBeing in some degree aware of these difficulties, though doubtless\nunacquainted both with their extent and the means by which they may be\nmodified or surmounted, I have, nevertheless, ventured to draw up the\nfollowing traditional narrative as a story in which, when the general\ndetails are known, the interest is so much concentrated in one strong\nmoment of agonizing passion, that it can be understood and sympathized\nwith at a single glance. I therefore presume that it may be acceptable\nas a hint to some one among the numerous artists who have of late\nyears distinguished themselves as rearing up and supporting the British\nschool.\n\nEnough has been said and sung about\n\n  \u201cThe well-contested ground,\n  The warlike Border-land,\u201d\n\nto render the habits of the tribes who inhabited it before the union of\nEngland and Scotland familiar to most of your readers. The rougher and\nsterner features of their character were softened by their attachment\nto the fine arts, from which has arisen the saying that on the frontiers\nevery dale had its battle, and every river its song. A rude species of\nchivalry was in constant use, and single combats were practised as the\namusement of the few intervals of truce which suspended the exercise of\nwar. The inveteracy of this custom may be inferred from the following\nincident:--\n\nBernard Gilpin, the apostle of the north, the first who undertook to\npreach the Protestant doctrines to the Border dalesmen, was surprised,\non entering one of their churches, to see a gauntlet or mail-glove\nhanging above the altar. Upon inquiring; the meaning of a symbol so\nindecorous being displayed in that sacred place, he was informed by the\nclerk that the glove was that of a famous swordsman, who hung it there\nas an emblem of a general challenge and gage of battle to any who should\ndare to take the fatal token down. \u201cReach it to me,\u201d said the reverend\nchurchman. The clerk and the sexton equally declined the perilous\noffice, and the good Bernard Gilpin was obliged to remove the glove with\nhis own hands, desiring those who were present to inform the champion\nthat he, and no other, had possessed himself of the gage of defiance.\nBut the champion was as much ashamed to face Bernard Gilpin as the\nofficials of the church had been to displace his pledge of combat.\n\nThe date of the following story is about the latter years of Queen\nElizabeth\u2019s reign; and the events took place in Liddesdale, a hilly and\npastoral district of Roxburghshire, which, on a part of its boundary, is\ndivided from England only by a small river.\n\nDuring the good old times of RUGGING AND RIVING--that is, tugging and\ntearing--under which term the disorderly doings of the warlike age are\naffectionately remembered, this valley was principally cultivated by the\nsept or clan of the Armstrongs. The chief of this warlike race was\nthe Laird of Mangerton. At the period of which I speak, the estate of\nMangerton, with the power and dignity of chief, was possessed by John\nArmstrong, a man of great size, strength, and courage. While his father\nwas alive, he was distinguished from others of his clan who bore the\nsame name, by the epithet of the LAIRD\u2019S JOCK--that is to say, the\nLaird\u2019s son Jock, or Jack. This name he distinguished by so many bold\nand desperate achievements, that he retained it even after his father\u2019s\ndeath, and is mentioned under it both in authentic records and in\ntradition. Some of his feats are recorded in the minstrelsy of the\nScottish Border, and others are mentioned in contemporary chronicles.\n\nAt the species of singular combat which we have described the Laird\u2019s\nJock was unrivalled, and no champion of Cumberland, Westmoreland, or\nNorthumberland could endure the sway of the huge two-handed sword which\nhe wielded, and which few others could even lift. This \u201cawful sword,\u201d as\nthe common people term it, was as dear to him as Durindana or Fushberta\nto their respective masters, and was nearly as formidable to his enemies\nas those renowned falchions proved to the foes of Christendom. The\nweapon had been bequeathed to him by a celebrated English outlaw named\nHobbie Noble, who, having committed some deed for which he was in danger\nfrom justice, fled to Liddesdale, and became a follower, or rather a\nbrother-in-arms, to the renowned Laird\u2019s Jock; till, venturing into\nEngland with a small escort, a faithless guide, and with a light\nsingle-handed sword instead of his ponderous brand, Hobbie Noble,\nattacked by superior numbers, was made prisoner and executed.\n\nWith this weapon, and by means of his own strength and address, the\nLaird\u2019s Jock maintained the reputation of the best swordsman on the\nBorder side, and defeated or slew many who ventured to dispute with him\nthe formidable title.\n\nBut years pass on with the strong and the brave as with the feeble\nand the timid. In process of time the Laird\u2019s Jock grew incapable of\nwielding his weapons, and finally of all active exertion, even of the\nmost ordinary kind. The disabled champion became at length totally\nbedridden, and entirely dependent for his comfort on the pious duties of\nan only daughter, his perpetual attendant and companion.\n\nBesides this dutiful child, the Laird\u2019s Jock had an only son, upon\nwhom devolved the perilous task of leading the clan to battle, and\nmaintaining the warlike renown of his native country, which was now\ndisputed by the English upon many occasions. The young Armstrong was\nactive, brave, and strong, and brought home from dangerous adventures\nmany tokens of decided success. Still, the ancient chief conceived,\nas it would seem, that his son was scarce yet entitled by age and\nexperience to be entrusted with the two-handed sword, by the use of\nwhich he had himself been so dreadfully distinguished.\n\nAt length an English champion, one of the name of Foster (if I rightly\nrecollect), had the audacity to send a challenge to the best swordsman\nin Liddesdale; and young Armstrong, burning for chivalrous distinction,\naccepted the challenge.\n\nThe heart of the disabled old man swelled with joy when he heard that\nthe challenge was passed and accepted, and the meeting fixed at a\nneutral spot, used as the place of rencontre upon such occasions, and\nwhich he himself had distinguished by numerous victories. He exulted\nso much in the conquest which he anticipated, that, to nerve his son to\nstill bolder exertions, he conferred upon him, as champion of his clan\nand province, the celebrated weapon which he had hitherto retained in\nhis own custody.\n\nThis was not all. When the day of combat arrived, the Laird\u2019s Jock, in\nspite of his daughter\u2019s affectionate remonstrances, determined, though\nhe had not left his bed for two years, to be a personal witness of the\nduel. His will was still a law to his people, who bore him on their\nshoulders, wrapped in plaids and blankets, to the spot where the combat\nwas to take place, and seated him on a fragment of rock, which is still\ncalled the Laird\u2019s Jock\u2019s stone. There he remained with eyes fixed on\nthe lists or barrier, within which the champions were about to meet.\nHis daughter, having done all she could for his accommodation, stood\nmotionless beside him, divided between anxiety for his health, and for\nthe event of the combat to her beloved brother. Ere yet the fight began,\nthe old men gazed on their chief, now seen for the first time after\nseveral years, and sadly compared his altered features and wasted\nframe with the paragon of strength and manly beauty which they once\nremembered. The young men gazed on his large form and powerful make as\nupon some antediluvian giant who had survived the destruction of the\nFlood.\n\nBut the sound of the trumpets on both sides recalled the attention\nof every one to the lists, surrounded as they were by numbers of both\nnations eager to witness the event of the day. The combatants met in the\nlists. It is needless to describe the struggle: the Scottish champion\nfell. Foster, placing his foot on his antagonist, seized on the\nredoubted sword, so precious in the eyes of its aged owner, and\nbrandished it over his head as a trophy of his conquest. The English\nshouted in triumph. But the despairing cry of the aged champion, who saw\nhis country dishonoured, and his sword, long the terror of their\nrace, in the possession of an Englishman, was heard high above the\nacclamations of victory. He seemed for an instant animated by all his\nwonted power; for he started from the rock on which he sat, and while\nthe garments with which he had been invested fell from his wasted frame,\nand showed the ruins of his strength, he tossed his arms wildly to\nheaven, and uttered a cry of indignation, horror, and despair, which,\ntradition says, was heard to a preternatural distance, and resembled the\ncry of a dying lion more than a human sound.\n\nHis friends received him in their arms as he sank utterly exhausted by\nthe effort, and bore him back to his castle in mute sorrow; while his\ndaughter at once wept for her brother, and endeavoured to mitigate and\nsoothe the despair of her father. But this was impossible; the old man\u2019s\nonly tie to life was rent rudely asunder, and his heart had broken with\nit. The death of his son had no part in his sorrow. If he thought of\nhim at all, it was as the degenerate boy through whom the honour of his\ncountry and clan had been lost; and he died in the course of three\ndays, never even mentioning his name, but pouring out unintermitted\nlamentations for the loss of his noble sword.\n\nI conceive that the moment when the disabled chief was roused into a\nlast exertion by the agony of the moment is favourable to the object of\na painter. He might obtain the full advantage of contrasting the form\nof the rugged old man, in the extremity of furious despair, with the\nsoftness and beauty of the female form. The fatal field might be thrown\ninto perspective, so as to give full effect to these two principal\nfigures, and with the single explanation that the piece represented a\nsoldier beholding his son slain, and the honour of his country lost, the\npicture would be sufficiently intelligible at the first glance. If it\nwas thought necessary to show more clearly the nature of the conflict,\nit might be indicated by the pennon of Saint George being displayed at\none end of the lists, and that of Saint Andrew at the other.\n\nI remain, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTHE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY.\n\n\n\n\n",
