    "body": "I was killing an hour in the billiard room of the _Spacemen's Club_\nin Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"Beg pardon, thir,\" he said with his racial lisp, \"thereth thome one to\nthee you in the main lounge.\" His eyes rolled as he added, \"A lady!\"\n\nA woman here...! The _Spacemen's_ was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n\nI followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n\nGrannie Annie!\n\nThere she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n\nI barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n\n\"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n\nThe desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....\"\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n\nIn the grille an equally astonished waiter served us--me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour--I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n\n\"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the _Spacemen's_? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n\n\"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n\nShe hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n\nBut the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n\nOne thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n\nShe was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n\n\"What happened to _Guns for Ganymede_?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"\n\n\n\nGrannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly\nrolled herself a cigarette.\n\n\"It wasn't _Guns_, it was _Pistols_; and it wasn't _Ganymede_, it was\n_Pluto_.\"\n\nI grinned. \"All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe\nand beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\"\n\n\"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can't have\nyour hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\"\n\nUp on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her\nfeet.\n\n\"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the _Satellite_ Theater in ten\nminutes. Come on, you're going with me.\"\n\nBefore I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\nthe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\ndrew up before the big doors of the _Satellite_.\n\nThey don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\ncolonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\nmuck, _zilcon_ wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\npacked with miners, freight-crew-men--all the tide and wash of humanity\nthat made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\n\nIn front was a big sign. It read:\n\n                            ONE NIGHT ONLY\n                        DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\n                             NINE GENIUSES\n                        THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\n                              THE SYSTEM\n\nAs we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\ntinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\nfront row.\n\n\"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of\nthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go\nsomewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\nstage steps and disappeared in the wings.\n\n\"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me\nyet.\"\n\nThe piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\nstage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\nsat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\nMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\nuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\nimproved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an\nEarthman operator.\n\n\n\nA tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings and\nadvanced to the footlights.\n\n\"People of Swamp City,\" he said, bowing, \"permit me to introduce\nmyself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.\"\n\nThere was a roar of applause from the _Satellite_ audience. When it had\nsubsided, the man continued:\n\n\"As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessary\nto give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage are\nnine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmitting\nsets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.\nThese questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For every\nquestion missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand\n_planetoles_.\n\n\"One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will match\nher wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer of\nscience fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.\"\n\nFrom the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her place\non the dais.\n\nThe Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted his\ndials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel to\ncoalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear his\nvoice echoed through the theater:\n\n\"_Who was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?_\"\n\nDoctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her\nhand. She said quietly:\n\n\"Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed\ntracto-car.\"\n\nAnd so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in\nthe visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian\ncafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering\nbantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,\nor when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of\nthe winner.\n\nIt grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had\nbrought me here. And then I began to notice things.\n\nThe audience in the _Satellite_ seemed to have lost much of its\noriginal fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the\nsignal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.\n\nPompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like a\ngeneral surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lips\nwere turned in a smile of satisfaction.\n\nWhen the last question had been answered I joined the exit-moving\ncrowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incident\noccurred.\n\nA yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,\ndragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had an\nunpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days of\nthe Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back to\nan earlier era.\n\nSomeone shouted, \"Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!\" As one\nman the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor\nwas seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,\nsnipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned\ninto his mouth.\n\nMoments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men\nrushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to\nshout derisive epithets.\n\nGrannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm\nand led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read\nTHE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place\nwas all but deserted.\n\nIn a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober\neyes.\n\n\"Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?\"\n\nI nodded. \"As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. men\nought to clamp down.\"\n\n\"The I.P. men aren't strong enough.\"\n\nShe said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harsh\nline about her usually smiling lips.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\nFor a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n\n\"My last book, _Death In The Atom_, hit the stands last January,\"\nshe began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\nKarn....\"\n\n\"Who?\" I interrupted.\n\n\"An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\nVarsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\nhis adventures, and he told me plenty.\"\n\nThe old woman paused. \"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?\" she\nasked abruptly.\n\nI shook my head. \"Some new kind of ...\"\n\n\"It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active\nrock once found on Mercury. The _Alpha_ rays of this rock are similar\nto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\nprojected at high speed. But the character of the _Gamma_ rays has\nnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\nelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\n_Beta_ or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\n\n\"When any form of life is exposed to these _Gamma_ rays from the Green\nFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude\nand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n\nI was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n\n\"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n\n\"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\nimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\nfollowed.\"\n\nGrannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\n\n\"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\nold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\ntravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\nan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!\"\n\nIf Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, \"So what?\"\n\n\"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n\n\"Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.\"\n\nGrannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I think.\"\n\nI got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\n\nShe regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\n\nThe old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\npolice officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\nrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\ndictator to step in.\n\n\"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\nsingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\nmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\ntimes more potent and is transmiting it _en masse_.\"\n\nIf it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\nhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\napproaching danger.\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" I said, getting up.\n\n_Zinnng-whack!_\n\n\"All right!\"\n\nOn the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\nappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the\nfresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\n\nA heat ray!\n\nGrannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\ndoor. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old\nwoman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and\nthrew over the starting stud.\n\nAn instant later we were plunging through the dark night.\n\n\n\nSix days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last\noutpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as\nthe eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick\nwater. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray\nsky like puffs of cotton.\n\nWe had traveled this far by _ganet_, the tough little two headed pack\nanimal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have\nhad its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force\nbelt that encircled the planet's equator. Now our drivers changed to\nboatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy _jagua_ canoes.\n\nIt was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her\nconfidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.\n\n\"We're heading directly for Varsoom country,\" she said. \"If we find\nEzra Karn so much the better. If we don't, we follow his directions to\nthe lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You\nsee, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the\nship.\"\n\nSleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours\ntossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned\nsteadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi\njust before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer\nthat broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an\nisolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had\ngiven me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly\ncoming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that\nrepresentative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held\nto find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.\n\nOutside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my\ntent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe\nGrannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots\nwhich she had skilfully blended into a novel?\n\nAbruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its\nplace a ringing silence blanketed everything.\n\nAnd then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in\nundulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched\nit advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.\nIt charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.\nThere was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp\ntalons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,\nmissing the thing by the narrowest of margins.\n\nFrom the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress\nappeared. Grannie gave a single warning:\n\n\"Stand still!\"\n\nThe thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us\nagain. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of\npurple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the\nair. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the\nground and shot aloft.\n\nI stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.\n\n\"In heaven's name, what was it?\"\n\n\"Hunter-bird,\" Grannie said calmly. \"A form of avian life found here\nin the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be\ntrained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain\nand follows with a relentless purpose.\"\n\n\"Then that would mean...?\"\n\n\"That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the\ncafe in Swamp City. Exactly.\" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her\ntent and faced me with earnest eyes. \"Billy-boy, our every move is\nbeing watched. From now on it's the survival of the fittest.\"\n\n\n\nThe following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\nresembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\nribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\nsurface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\nthe swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\nmulti-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\nThe Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\nhand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\na matter of seconds.\n\nAt high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\nof the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\njetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\n\nHe was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\nunkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\ndressed in _varpa_ cloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\nhead was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\n\n\"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\nFlowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\nhut.\n\nThe place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\ntype of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\ncivilization entirely.\n\nGrannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the\nobject of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.\n\n\"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could\nfind that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a\ncigarette. \"You know where it is, don't you?\"\n\n\"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in\nVarsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.\"\n\n\"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\"\n\nKarn shook his head. \"They're a form of life that's never been seen by\nEarthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.\"\n\n\"Dangerous?\"\n\n\"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside\nof myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away\nbecause I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped\nbecause he made 'em laugh.\"\n\n\"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie's face.\n\n\"That's right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction\nthat's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them\nlaugh, I don't know.\"\n\nFood supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.\nSeveral mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the\nVenusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.\n\n\"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain't missed one in months.\nYou gotta wait 'til I hear it.\"\n\nGrannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He\nflipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a\nchair, listening with avid interest.\n\nIt was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I\nheard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once\nagain I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back\nand forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi\nscreen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead\nmy thoughts far away.\n\n\n\nHalf an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen\nwere ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We\ncamped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed\nabout us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and\ndespondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the\nfutility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me\nfrom turning back. On the morrow I realized the truth in her warning,\nthat all of us had been exposed to the insidious radiations.\n\nAfter that I lost track of time. Day after day of incessant rain ... of\nsteaming swamp.... But at length we reached firm ground and began our\nadvance on foot.\n\nIt was Karn who first sighted the ship. Striding in the lead, he\nsuddenly halted at the top of a hill and leveled his arm before him.\nThere it lay, a huge cigar-shaped vessel of blackened _arelium_ steel,\nhalf buried in the swamp soil.\n\n\"What's that thing on top?\" Karn demanded, puzzled.\n\nA rectangular metal envelope had been constructed over the stern\nquarters of the ship. Above this structure were three tall masts. And\nsuspended between them was a network of copper wire studded with white\ninsulators.\n\nGrannie gazed a long moment through binoculars. \"Billy-boy, take three\nVenusians and head across the knoll,\" she ordered. \"Ezra and I will\ncircle in from the west. Fire a gun if you strike trouble.\"\n\nBut we found no trouble. The scene before us lay steeped in silence.\nMoments later our two parties converged at the base of the great ship.\n\nA metal ladder extended from the envelope down the side of the vessel.\nMid-way we could see a circular hatch-like door.\n\n\"Up we go, Billy-boy.\" Heat gun in readiness, Grannie Annie began to\nclimb slowly.\n\nThe silence remained absolute. We reached the door and pulled it open.\nThere was no sign of life.\n\n\"Somebody's gone to a lot of trouble here,\" Ezra Karn observed.\n\nSomebody had. Before us stretched a narrow corridor, flanked on the\nleft side by a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The corridor was\nbare of furnishings. But beyond the glass, revealed to us in mocking\nclarity, was a high panel, studded with dials and gauges. Even as we\nlooked, we could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indicator needles\nswing slowly to and fro.\n\nGrannie nodded. \"Some kind of a broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in\nthe lower hold are probably exposed to a _tholpane_ plate and their\nradiations stepped up by an electro-phosicalic process.\"\n\nKarn raised the butt of his pistol and brought it crashing against the\nglass wall. His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass remained intact.\n\n\"You'll never do it that way,\" Grannie said. \"Nothing short of an\natomic blast will shatter that wall. It explains why there are no\nguards here. The mechanism is entirely self-operating. Let's see if the\nGreen Flames are more accessible.\"\n\nIn the lower hold disappointment again confronted us. Visible in\nthe feeble shafts of daylight that filtered through cracks in the\nvessel's hull were tiers of rectangular ingots of green iridescent ore.\nSuspended by insulators from the ceiling over them was a thick metal\nplate.\n\nBut between was a barrier. A wall of impenetrable stepto glass.\n\nGrannie stamped her foot. \"It's maddening,\" she said. \"Here we are at\nthe crux of the whole matter, and we're powerless to make a single\nmove.\"\n\n\n\nOutside the day was beginning to wane. The Venusians, apparently\nunawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fire\nand erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of brooding\ndesolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal this\ntime was a gloomy affair. When it was finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipe\nand switched on the portable visi set. A moment later the silence of\nthe march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universe\nprogram.\n\n\"Great stuff,\" Karn commented. \"I sent in a couple of questions once,\nbut I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Ought\nto make him king or somethin'.\"\n\nFor a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leaped\nto her feet.\n\n\"Say that again!\" she cried.\n\nThe old prospector looked startled. \"Why, I only said they ought to\nmake this Doctor Universe the big boss and....\"\n\n\"That's it!\" Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darkness\nand returned quickly. \"Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this\n_is_ Doctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised a\nmethod to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter's\nhold. He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast those radiations in such\na way that millions of persons would be exposed to them simultaneously.\nDon't you see?\"\n\nI didn't see, but Grannie hurried on.\n\n\"What better way to expose civilized life to the Green Flames\nradiations than when the people are in a state of relaxation. The\nDoctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, but\nthey were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiations\nfrom the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, and\ntheir wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonic\nscale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....\"\n\n\"But with what motive?\" I demanded. \"Why should...?\"\n\n\"Power!\" the old woman answered. \"The old thirst for dictatorial\ncontrol of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius,\nDoctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in the\nminds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames'\nradiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.\"\n\nI sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream.\n\nAnd then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over the\ntents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere had\ndropped away to be replaced by another.\n\nThere it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got the\nimpression I was looking around that space rather than through it. And\nsimultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later the\nold prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly.\n\nAn invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow was\nfollowed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down.\nOpposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similar\npunishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment.\n\n\"It's the Varsoom!\" Ezra Karn yelled. \"We've got to make 'em laugh. Our\nonly escape is to make 'em laugh!\"\n\nHe struggled to his feet and began leaping wildly around the camp fire.\nAbruptly his foot caught on a log protruding from the fire; he tripped\nand fell headlong into a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a jumping\njack he was on his feet again, clawing dirt and soot from his eyes.\n\nOut of the empty space about us there came a sudden hush. The unseen\nblows ceased in mid-career. And then the silence was rent by wild\nlaughter. Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears.\nFor many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything was\npeaceful once more.\n\nGrannie Annie picked herself up slowly. \"That was close,\" she said. \"I\nwouldn't want to go through that again.\"\n\nEzra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. \"Those Varsoom got a funny\nsense of humor,\" he growled.\n\n\n\nInside the freighter's narrow corridor Grannie faced me with eyes\nfilled with excitement.\n\n\"Billy-boy,\" she said, \"we've got two problems now. We've got to stop\nDoctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here.\nRight now we're nicely bottled up.\"\n\nAs if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quiz\nmaster on the screen. He was saying:\n\n\"_Remember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message of\nunparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrow\nnight I urge you, I command you, to tune in._\"\n\nWith a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of the\nVenusians.\n\n\"Bring all our equipment in here,\" she ordered. \"Hurry!\"\n\nShe untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap. She rolled\nup her sleeves, and as the Venusians came marching into the space ship\nwith bundles of equipment, she fell to work.\n\nSilently Ezra Karn and I watched her. First she completely dismantled\nthe visi set, put it together again with an entirely altered hookup.\nNext she unrolled a coil of flexible copper mesh which we had brought\nalong as a protective electrical screening against the marsh insects.\nShe fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh at intervals of every\ntwelve inches or more, carried it down to the freighter's hold and\nfastened it securely against the stepto glass wall.\n\nTrailing a three-ply conduit up from the hold to the corridor she\nselected an induction coil, several Micro-Wellman tubes and a quantity\nof wire from a box of spare parts. Dexterously her fingers moved in and\nout, fashioning a complicated and curious piece of apparatus.\n\nAt length she finished.\n\n\"It's pretty hay-wire,\" she said, \"but I think it will work. Now I'll\ntell you what I'm going to do. When Doctor Universe broadcasts tomorrow\nnight, he's going to announce that he has set himself up as supreme\ndictator. He'll have the Green Flame radiations coming from this ship\nunder full power. I'm going to insert into his broadcast--the laughing\nof the Varsoom!\"\n\n\"You're going to what?\"\n\n\"Broadcast the mass laughter from those invisible creatures out there.\nVisualize it, Billy-boy! At the dramatic moment when Doctor Universe\nmakes his plea for System-wide power, he will be accompanied by wild\npeals of laughter. The whole broadcast will be turned into a burlesque.\"\n\n\"How you going to make 'em laugh?\" interrupted Karn.\n\n\"We must think of a way,\" Grannie replied soberly.\n\nI, for one, am glad that no representative of the Interstellar\nPsychiatry Society witnessed our antics during the early hours of that\nmorning and on into the long reaches of the afternoon, as we vainly\ntried to provoke the laughter of the Varsoom. All to no avail. Utter\nsilence greeted our efforts. And the time was growing close to the\nscheduled Doctor Universe program.\n\nEzra Karn wiped a bead of perspiration from his brow. \"Maybe we've got\nto attract their attention first,\" he suggested. \"Miss Flowers, why\ndon't you go up on the roof and read to 'em? Read 'em something from\none of your books, if you've got one along. That ought to make 'em sit\nup and take notice.\"\n\nFor a moment the old woman gazed at him in silence. Then she got to her\nfeet quickly.\n\n\"I'll do it,\" she said. \"I'll read them the attack scene from _Murder\nOn A Space Liner_.\"\n\n\n\nIt didn't make sense, of course. But nothing made sense in this mad\nventure. Grannie Annie opened her duffel bag and drew out a copy of\nher most popular book. With the volume under her arm, she mounted the\nladder to the top of the envelope. Ezra Karn rigged up a radite search\nlamp, and a moment later the old woman stood in the center of a circle\nof white radiance.\n\nKarn gripped my arm. \"This is it,\" he said tensely. \"If this fails ...\"\n\nHis voice clipped off as Grannie began to read. She read slowly\nat first, then intoned the words and sentences faster and more\ndramatically.\n\nAnd out in the swamp a vast hush fell as if unseen ears were listening.\n\n\"... _the space liner was over on her beam ends now as another shot\nfrom the raider's vessel crashed into the stern hold. In the control\ncabin Cuthbert Strong twisted vainly at his bonds as he sought to free\nhimself. Opposite him, lashed by strong Martian vinta ropes to the\ngravascope, Louise Belmont sobbed softly, wringing her hands in mute\nappeal._\"\n\nA restless rustling sounded out in the marsh, as if hundreds of bodies\nwere surging closer. Karn nodded in awe.\n\n\"She's got 'em!\" he whispered. \"Listen. They're eatin' up every word.\"\n\nI heard it then, and I thought I must be dreaming. From somewhere out\nin the swamp a sound rose into the thick air. A high-pitched chuckle,\nit was. The chuckle came again. Now it was followed by another and\nanother. An instant later a wave of low subdued laughter rose into the\nair.\n\nEzra Karn gulped. \"Gripes!\" he said. \"They're laughing already.\n_They're laughing at her book!_ And look, the old lady's gettin' sore.\"\n\nUp on the roof of the envelope Grannie Annie halted her reading to\nglare savagely out into the darkness.\n\nThe laughter was a roar now. It rose louder and louder, peal after peal\nof mirthful yells and hysterical shouts. And for the first time in my\nlife, I saw Annabella C. Flowers mad. She stamped her foot; she shook\nher fist at the unseen hordes out before her.\n\n\"Ignorant slap-happy fools!\" she screamed. \"You don't know good science\nfiction when you hear it.\"\n\nI turned to Karn and said quietly, \"Turn on the visi set. Doctor\nUniverse should be broadcasting now. Tune your microphone to pull in\nas much of that laughter as you can.\"\n\n\n\nIt took three weeks to make the return trip to Swamp City. The Varsoom\nfollowed us far beyond the frontier of their country like an unseen\narmy in the throes of laughing gas. Not until we reached Level Five did\nthe last chuckle fade into the distance.\n\nAll during that trek back, Grannie sat in the dugout, staring silently\nout before her.\n\nBut when we reached Swamp City, the news was flung at us from all\nsides. One newspaper headline accurately told the story: DOCTOR\nUNIVERSE BID FOR SYSTEM DICTATORSHIP SQUELCHED BY RIDICULE OF UNSEEN\nAUDIENCE. QUIZ MASTER NOW IN HANDS OF I.P. COUP FAILURE.\n\n\"Grannie,\" I said that night as we sat again in a rear booth of THE\nJET, \"what are you going to do now? Give up writing science fiction?\"\n\nShe looked at me soberly, then broke into a smile.\n\n\"Just because some silly form of life that can't even be seen doesn't\nappreciate it? I should say not. Right now I've got an idea for a swell\nyarn about Mars. Want to come along while I dig up some background\nmaterial?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Not me,\" I said.\n\nBut I knew I would.\n\n\n\n\n",
