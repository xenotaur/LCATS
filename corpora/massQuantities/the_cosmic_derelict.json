    "body": "It was Tug Skelly's fault that the Starways freighter, _Lucifer_,\nfour hours out of Orion City, was running behind time; and Captain\nChristopher Douglas, Starways' newest and youngest Old Man, found it\nhard to maintain the dignity befitting a transgalactic skipper, as he\ninveighed against the guilty bo'sun in his cabin.\n\n\"Twenty-four hours lost in port, Mr. Jackson,\" Captain Douglas groaned,\ndropping the latest triangulator readings to his desk. \"A full day we\ncan't possibly make up! And no one to blame for it but bo'sun Skelly!\"\n\nFirst mate Pete Jackson, who had just brought the computator results\ninto the cabin, responded to the captain's forlorn glance with a\nclucking noise and a sympathetic grimace of his blue-eyed, terrier's\nface. There was no doubt that Douglas' vexation with Tug Skelly was\njustified; but Jackson felt called upon to put in a word for his\nunfortunate shipmate.\n\n\"I wouldn't be too hard on Tug, sir,\" Pete Jackson said placatingly.\n\"He may have some queer ways, but after you get to know him ye'll\nlikely find Tug a pretty valuable hand aboard ship.\"\n\n\"All I would like to know,\" Captain Douglas returned unhappily, \"is why\nin Old Nick he had to nose out that stowaway in Orion right at blasting\ntime? Why didn't he just keep that big turnip of his where it belonged!\"\n\nJackson shrugged helplessly. The _Lucifer's_ youngish, new skipper\njust didn't know Tug Skelly yet, that was the truth. It was clearly\nno part of a bo'sun's duties to hunt down stowaways; but then Tug had\nnever been content to perform only his duties. The plain fact was that\nthe stowaway, a pink-skinned Orionian, had sneaked aboard right after\nloading was finished. He was apparently seen by no one except the\nusually sleepy-eyed Tug; but that alone proved more than enough to\nspell the poor devil's doom.\n\n\"If it hadn't been for the Orion port authorities, though,\" Mate\nJackson essayed weakly, \"we'd have blasted on schedule. I know Tug\ndidn't intend to stir them up, sir.\"\n\n\"No!\" Captain Douglas jeered miserably. \"I suppose not. But that\ninfernal racket he raised chasing the stowaway was enough to bring the\nwhole city aboard!\"\n\nJackson nodded sadly. The Orionian port officials, summoned by Tug's\nwild bellowings, had swarmed on the ship _en masse_, like a brood\nof pink and imperturbable owls. They helped Tug snag the first\nstowaway; and then, over Douglas' frantic protests, they very slowly\nand assiduously fine-combed the _Lucifer_ the rest of that night for\nothers. They didn't find any more stowaways, but by the time the\n_Lucifer_ got clearance an entire day had elapsed, leaving Captain\nDouglas in a near catatonic state. The guilty Skelly meanwhile had\nmysteriously disappeared underdeck--where, for all Jackson knew, he\nstill was.\n\nFirst Mate Jackson stirred uneasily. A suspicion suddenly shot through\nhis mind regarding Tug's possible motive in acting the way he did.\nBut the little first carefully refrained from voicing his thought. If\nit were true, it would definitely not help the big bo'sun's case with\nCaptain Douglas!\n\n\"Like I said, sir,\" Pete Jackson contented himself by sighing, \"Tug's\nmostly a first-rate bo'sun, though sometimes he does get sort of queer\nideas. However--\" Jackson added hastily, \"you can depend on all the\nboys now. I mean, Captain, Sparks told us about that message that\ncame from the owners a while back; you can bank on it we'll all do\neverything possible to help you make up the time.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jackson,\" Douglas said gratefully. \"I appreciate that.\"\n\nCaptain Douglas spoke with some composure, but, after Jackson saluted\nsmartly and left the cabin, the young skipper's _papier mache_ dignity\nmelted rapidly and he slumped down into his swivel. The first officer's\npromise was merely a gesture, as both men knew. The _Lucifer_ was at\ntop speed, doing better than ten and a half kilos, but the computator\nshowed that even that would fetch New York nearly twenty hours late.\nChristopher Douglas' usually trim blond mustache drooped woe-begonely,\nbut he was too miserable to straighten it.\n\nInstead, he parted the braids of his breveted uniform and drew a\ncrumpled slip of paper from his breast pocket. The radiogram Jackson\nhad referred to was from A. J. Braithewaite himself, president of\nStarways. It had come only a few hours before; and, re-reading it,\nDouglas could still hardly believe his own ill luck. Belated rocketings\nwere always held against Starways skippers; but the _Lucifer's_ tardy\narrival threatened to be starkly tragic.\n\n_Captain Douglas_, the gram went, _Solar Council going off platinum\nstandard as of twelve midnight July third. Imperative that you bring\nLucifer in as scheduled by noon that day. Any delay in arriving will\ncost Starways huge sum on your cargo of platinum. Am certain you will\nnot fail us. Braithewaite._\n\n\n\nDouglas sank down into the swivel until his smooth, clean-shaven chin\nalmost rested on the desk top. The spanking new _Lucifer_, cargoing a\nbin full of Orion's precious powdered platinum, was Chris Douglas's\nfirst real deep-galactic command--after years of school theorizing and\npractical activity as everything from a galley-knave to a blast-wiper.\nHe loved his new ship; but already his first voyage under his own\nticket threatened to be his last! Starways' hard-boiled employee policy\nmight well put him on a muck-ridden asteroid run after this, or ground\nhim altogether.\n\nChris Douglas groaned and ran a limp hand over his moist face. He\nhadn't felt more sheerly miserable since he was turned down by the\nlady of his choice when he was fifteen. The lady, to be sure, was\nalmost twice his age then; but even so her answer still rankled. She\nwas his schoolmarm, and she had made it painfully clear that under\nno circumstances would she consider becoming engaged to a fat little\nappleknocker like Christopher Douglas. Her name was Lucy; and it still\ngave him a pang to recall her cool gray eyes and her--\n\n\"Beg pardon, Cap'n. Are yuh busy?\"\n\nDouglas looked up with a start. A big face--quite different from the\nbeautiful vision in his mind--was framed in the aperture formed by\nthe partly open cabin door. It was a thoroughly, almost enjoyably,\nugly face, that looked as if it had been kneaded by a crazy baker. It\npossessed just about the color and consistency of limp dough. Captain\nDouglas straightened slowly in his seat as he gazed on it.\n\n\"Skelly!\" He said ominously, \"come in!\"\n\nBo'sun Tug Skelly came in cautiously, as if he were afraid of wrecking\nthe daintily appointed cabin by one awkward movement of his great,\nbrawny frame. He held his cap very respectfully in one gnarled\nhand; but his huge face wore what Douglas thought was an altogether\nout-of-place grin. He looked like an overgrown urchin who is caught\nswiping pies but is unrepentant because of a full stomach.\n\n\"I suppose,\" Captain Douglas said icily when the big bo'sun stood\nbefore his desk, \"that you know what your shenanigans in Orion has\ncost, Skelly!\"\n\n\"Yessir,\" Tug grinned unblushingly, \"but don't let that bother yuh too\nmuch, Cap'n. Shux, so long's we got rid o' that stowaway everything'll\nbe shipshape, never fear.\"\n\n\"Listen, Skelly,\" Captain Douglas rose holding the shreds of his\ndignity around him with a shaking hand, \"are you aware that we could\nhave cargoed that Orionian from here to Betelgeuse and back for what\nthe lost day is going to cost?\"\n\nTug nodded brightly. He was obviously not too impressed by his young\nsuperior's analogy. \"Sure, Cap'n,\" he said easily, \"but we wouldn't\nhave got very far with him. I mean we'd've had an accident o' some\nkind. Maybe a rocket tube woulda slipped its moorings; maybe the\ngravs woulda gone dead without no reason. But something woulda\nhappened--that's the godshonest truth.\"\n\nCaptain Douglas's eyes, red-rimmed from lack of sleep, opened wide;\nthen narrowed dazedly. He was remembering something Mate Jackson had\nsaid about queer ideas.\n\n\"Yesiree, Cap'n,\" Tug spoke confidently since he obviously held the\nnew master's undivided, even spellbound attention. \"Everybody knows a\nstowaway's bad jinks; but not many aside from Tug Skelly knows jest\nhow bad an _Orionian_ stowaway can be! Cap'n Douglas, an Orionian\nstowaway's no different from a cargo o' loose cordite. He's jest bound\nto cause mischief on a ship.\"\n\n\"Mischief!\" Captain Douglas felt that that was a poor way to describe\nthe fix they were already in; but he didn't pursue the point. Another\naspect of the bo'sun's speech drew his attention. It was obvious that\nin Tug Skelly, he, Chris Douglas, was confronted by a withering example\nof ignorance on the loose. All the new skipper's years of training,\nhis sleeplessness and his distraught nerves, rose gorgelike at this\nshambling, dough-faced anachronism who posed as a space sailor.\n\n\"Bo'sun Skelly,\" Douglas said acidly, \"your remarks reveal an\nincredible disregard for the scientific viewpoint. In fact, I haven't\nheard such sinful tommyrot since I was six--and even then I knew\nbetter. An Orionian stowaway, or any other stowaway, Mister Skelly, can\ncause no more damage to a vessel than the amount of edible cargo he can\nconsume. The rest is rubbish.\"\n\nTug looked hurt. \"I dunno, Cap'n,\" he said slowly. \"Now you take the\n_Campanella_--the big liner that jes' blew apart one day off Venus.\nWhat did the Safety Board investigation show afterwards? Why, that she\nwas carrying a whole nestful of Orionians underdeck!\"\n\nAnd Tug flashed his young master a look of triumphant vindication.\nChris Douglas heaved a long breath and slumped back in the swivel. The\ntask of bringing bo'sun's Skelly's education up to date was clearly\nnot one for a single afternoon. Nor, with Braithewaite's message still\nbefore him, did the skipper feel any taste for the job.\n\n\"Bo'sun Skelly,\" Douglas sighed disgustedly, \"did you come here to\nregale me with your views on Orionian stowaways?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" Tug scratched his head and grinned a little at the captain's\npeculiar way of talking. \"Naw, but I almost did forget, sir. Fact is,\nCap'n, I come to tell yuh how to make up the day we lost. Yessir.\"\n\n\"You did!\" Douglas sneered miserably. \"How? By getting out and pushing?\nOr simply by wishing on a star? The _Lucifer_ can't do any more than\nten and a half kilos.\"\n\n\"She don't hafta,\" Tug said equably, no whit abashed by the irony. \"We\ncan gain a lot o' time by using an old route I know. I forget the real\nname, but it's called the Pass o' the Twin Witches. It's at the tip o'\nthe Southern Cross, Cap'n. Joshua P. MacLevy, my old skipper, used to\ntell me about it. It'll save--\"\n\n\n\nBut Chris Douglas was no longer heeding the big bo'sun. His eyes, which\nhad widened suddenly as Tug spoke, were now peering at the great blue\nand white astrochart on the wall back of his desk. He rose and fixed\nhis gaze on a little star-clustered area far off the main commercial\nroutes--the tip of the Southern Cross. Then he sprang to the desk and\nbegan working with a pencil. A moment later, he looked up strangely\nexcited. It was no wonder he hadn't thought of the Cross Straits--the\nold pass had been out of use for over fifty years. For vague reasons,\nit still had a bad name and skippers avoided it. But Chris Douglas was\nno shell-backed worshipper of traditions.\n\n\"Skelly,\" he said regarding the bo'sun with new shining eyes. \"I think\nyou've got something! Using the old Cross Straits will clip nearly a\nmillion kilos from our course, and give us a good chance to fetch New\nYork on time. A very good chance!\"\n\nCaptain Douglas' sudden, almost boyish enthusiasm was infectious, but\nnow it was his bo'sun's turn to become oddly perturbed. The wrinkles on\nSkelly's massive face were as big as troughs.\n\n\"That's right, Cap'n,\" Tug nodded uneasily, \"but the Pass is pretty\ndangerous, yuh know. If yuh leave it to me, there won't be no need to\nworry, though. I know how to fix those hags so they can't touch the\n_Lucifer_ no matter how hard they try!\"\n\n\"Hags?\" Captain Douglas said with a now friendly smile. \"What hags are\nyou talking about, Tug?\"\n\n\"The witches, Cap'n, that guard the Pass.\" Tug's voice had dropped to\na whisper and he leaned forward with a fearful, secretive air. \"There\nare two o' them, Cap'n Douglas. One on each side. Giants they are, and\nwoe to the poor ship as passes under their hot breath without first\nundergoin' the ritual o' purification! But don't you worry, Cap'n. I\nknow the formula that'll wash all the sins from the _Lucifer_ and leave\nher clean as a baby. Yes sir!\"\n\n\"What the dickens--!\" Captain Douglas began with a dazed frown. But\nTug Skelly went on hurriedly; it was clear that he regarded the young\nskipper's astonishment as an evil omen.\n\n\"All we gotta do, Cap'n,\" Tug pleaded, \"is give the _Lucifer_ a pure\nwhite soul; and I can do it. Jes' let me handle it, Cap'n Douglas, and\nthose two witches won't bother us a bit.\"\n\n\"Bo'sun Skelly!\" Captain Douglas swallowed hard and gathered his\nbenumbed senses. \"I have heard tall tales and weird stories; but for\nsheer cockeyed balderdash yours is far and away the best yet! Your\nsuggestion of the Cross Straits was invaluable; and I am very grateful\nto you for it. But by Jupiter if you go on talking about Twin Witches\nI'll have to clap you in irons. Good day.\"\n\nTug started to protest, but something about Young Douglas' clamped jaw\nmade him halt and drop his big arms to his sides miserably. He stood\nthere for a moment before mumbling a low, \"Aye, aye,\" and offering\na clumsy salute. Then he turned and walked from the cabin, his big\nshoulders drooped despairingly.\n\nCaptain Chris Douglas mopped his brow when he was alone in his quarters.\n\n\"Witches,\" he murmured incredulously. \"Purifying the soul of a ship\nagainst witches!\"\n\nHe gave his close-cropped, blond head a vigorous shake, as if to clear\nit of any goblins or pixies that might have crept in by contamination\nwith Tug Skelly; and a second later he was at the desk communicator\ncontacting the bridge.\n\n\"Mr. Jackson,\" Captain Douglas said when he heard the mate's voice. \"I\nhave decided to change our course. You will take all readings necessary\nto bring the _Lucifer_ to the Straits of the Cross.... Yes, Mr.\nJackson, I said the Straits of the Cross. At once!\"\n\n\n\nThe _Lucifer_, a hollow black needle in the immense twilight of space,\nhurtled eagerly on the second day out toward the new pole her tiny\nmasters had set for her. But First Mate Pete Jackson alone on the\nbridge didn't find himself any too eager about their new route. For one\nthing, the last three ships known to have tried the Cross Straits had\nnever been heard from afterwards. For another, Jackson just didn't feel\neasy traveling off the main lanes.\n\nHe had intimated his fears to Captain Douglas at mess that morning; but\nwithout making any impression on the young skipper.\n\n\"Sure I know about those ships that were lost in the Straits fifty\nyears ago,\" Captain Douglas had responded cheerfully, fresh from a much\nneeded sleep. \"But that was fifty years ago, Mr. Jackson. Those early\nether-blasters were just clay pigeons to space hazards that can't even\ntickle the _Lucifer_. Our ship is equipped with every modern safety\ndevice known to astrogation. I think we'll get through all right.\"\n\nPete Jackson rolled the captain's words over in his mind and shifted in\nhis seat before the visiplate with a sigh. A moment later, he jumped\nwith a startled oath as a heavy finger prodded his shoulder. It was\nTug Skelly, looking as big and mournful as a Great Dane bereft of his\nmaster. But Pete Jackson wasted no sympathy on his ungainly subordinate.\n\n\"Hah! It's you,\" the little mate said with fierce scorn. \"I suppose\nye've come to tell me about those witches of yours, eh? Well, you're\nwastin' y' time. Captain Douglas's already told me about your crazy\nideas; and I must say you made a proper fool of yourself before the new\nskipper, Tug. I'm thoroughly disgusted with you!\"\n\n\"Pete,\" Tug pleaded, \"it's true what I said about the Twin Witches. Old\nJosh MacLevy told me about 'em, and you know he wouldn't jes' spin a\nyarn. Listen, Pete, all I need for the ritual o' purification is a lot\no' white paint. You gimme a release for the paint and I'll attend to\nall the rest. Please, Pete.\"\n\nBut Jackson was adamant.\n\n\"First off,\" the mate grunted sourly, \"we ain't got a pail of white\npaint aboard. Second, I wouldn't give it to ye, if we had it! The\ntrouble with you, Tug, is you need some education. You're worse than an\nold Irishlady when it comes to superstitions, and that's a fact.\"\n\nCaptain Douglas had used those very words to describe the bo'sun when\nhe and the mate spoke at mess. But Pete Jackson felt no qualms of\nplagiarism in borrowing the apt phrases. He even remembered a little\nmore the new skipper had said.\n\n\"Tug,\" Jackson advised with a superior air, \"I think you'd better\ntake a home study course next voyage in the elements of physics and\nchemistry. That's what you need--a little educating. Take it from the\nCaptain and me.\"\n\nFor a long moment, Tug Skelly played miserably with fingers that were\nlike bananas. Then he heaved a sigh and turned. At the bulkhead,\nhowever, he looked back.\n\n\"Edjacation,\" he asserted with a truculent nod, \"ain't everything,\nPete. No, sir!\" And with that Tug lumbered out.\n\nPete Jackson snorted and turned troubledly once again to his forward\nsight. The nearer the _Lucifer_ got to the Straits, the more the first\nmate found himself wishing they were back on the good old slow lanes.\nThere were no familiar skymarks here; and the _Lucifer_ was being\nguided by dead reckoning. Yet, remembering young Douglas's words,\nJackson took heart.\n\n\"Witches!\" Pete Jackson scoffed aloud to the empty bridge round him.\n\"Hah!\" But the sneer didn't sound too convincing even to himself.\n\n\n\nIt was the beginning of the long middle watch, when most of the\n_Lucifer's_ crew slept; but Tug Skelly returning to his bunk didn't\ngo right to sleep as usual. Instead, he paced his narrow deck for\nmany long minutes--before finally beginning an activity that would\nundoubtedly have astonished any of his shipmates if they had been\nawake to witness it. Out of his cabin locker, Tug dragged his battered\nbulger. And as he donned it the bo'sun's massive face, gargoyled\nby the port starlight, wore a strangely desperate but determined\nexpression. He went down into the holds and stayed there for some time\nbefore he finally emerged on the hull.\n\nAll during the long watch that ticked away inside the peaceful\n_Lucifer_, a shapeless, bulging form toiled outside her hull. The\nmyriad stars roundabout blinked in amazement at the tiny, squid-like\nobject that moved on the great hull. They watched with endless\ncuriosity as the moving blob several times disappeared from view only\nto reappear again. And they marveled greatly at how the aspect of the\nhull was changed wherever the restless object toiled. When finally the\nblob disappeared for the last time, the stars blinked in delighted\nwonder at the vision he had left them. The middle watch inside the\n_Lucifer_ was not yet ended when Tug Skelly crawled out of his bulger\nand toppled into his bunk like a stricken Sequoia.\n\n\n\n\"_Captain. Captain Douglas._\"\n\nThe _Lucifer's_ young skipper opened his eyes, focused them on the lad\nwho was shaking him by the shoulder, and sat upright. It was Andy, the\ngalley-boy, who stood before the bed, his tow-thatched face screwed up\npuzzledly.\n\n\"Captain Douglas,\" Andy said scratching his head, \"the cook sent me to\nwake you. He said to get you up. It's something about the ship, sir.\"\n\n\"Something about the ship!\" Douglas was out of bed like a shot. \"What\nare you talking about?\"\n\n\"The _Lucifer_, sir,\" Andy grinned mysteriously. \"She's all white\noutside--like a yacht. The cook saw it first this morning when we were\nemptying the slop pail. He says she's beautiful, nicer now than A. J.\nBraithewaite's yacht. The cook said that.\"\n\n\"He did?\" Chris Douglas rubbed the last vestige of sleep from his eyes\nand strode to the communicator in his outside cabin, where he proceeded\nat once to contact first mate Jackson.\n\n\"Mr. Jackson,\" Douglas said suspiciously when he got the mate, \"did you\ngive orders to paint the hull? What? Yes. Unless Andy here is crazy.\nPut on a suit and meet me at the forward lock at once.\"\n\nTwo minutes later, Captain Douglas and first mate Jackson, each clad\nin bulgers, climbed laboriously out of the lock. Both men stared in\nsimultaneous astonishment at the sight that met their eyes when they\nemerged on the broad hull. Around them, the _Lucifer's_ former dark\nsteel torso was now a sea of glistening whiteness. Every inch of the\nhull had been covered; the _Lucifer_ preened like a snowbird under her\nfrosty new plumage that stretched from stem to stern. Reaching down a\ngloved hand, Douglas found that the paint was still tacky, a little of\nit came away on his fingers.\n\n\"_Jumping Jupiter!_\" Captain Douglas whispered shakily. \"What's going\non here? First, our crazy bo'sun starts chasing stowaways in port; and\nnow someone paints my ship a pure blasted white while I'm asleep. What\nkind of a voyage is this, Mr. Jackson!\"\n\nBut as he spoke the words \"pure white\" a gleam of suspicion shot into\nthe Captain's eyes.\n\n\"Skelly!\" Douglas said with sudden vehemence. \"Skelly's ritual of\npurification.\"\n\nMate Jackson nodded troubledly. The connection between Tug's latest\nremarks and this deed was all too apparent. But something more was\nworrying the little first mate at the moment.\n\n\"Maybe it was Tug, sir,\" Pete Jackson said puzzledly, \"but what I'd\nlike to know is where the devil he got all the white paint? I happen\nto know we moved every can of paint off ship to make room for the\nplatinum. Yes, sir. I had it done myself.\"\n\n\"The platinum?\" Captain Douglas repeated the word very slowly; then he\nstared for a long, terrible moment at the white stain on his fingers.\nPete Jackson stared at the stain, too. A second later, the two men\nbroke as one body for the lock behind them.\n\nDown in the hold where the platinum was kept, Captain Douglas panted\nheavily, and stared about him with the haggard look of a man who has\nreceived a mortal blow.\n\nAround the two men, the precious cargo had been vandalled. The empty\ntins were strewn all over the hold. Of all the powdered platinum,\nperhaps a dozen or two cans remained intact. The rest of it--and no\nother conclusion was possible--now adorned the steel hull of the\n_Lucifer_!\n\n\"Bring Tug Skelly to my quarters, Mr. Jackson,\" Captain Douglas said\nin a mechanical voice. \"Under guard if necessary.\"\n\n\n\nBut Tug came to the Captain's cabin without protest, even though he\ncame not too happily. There shone, however, under bo'sun's Caliban\ncountenance, the kind of inner serenity that can only come from doing\nthe right thing regardless of consequences. Captain Douglas eyed the\nculprit wrathfully.\n\n\"Bo'sun Skelly,\" Douglas shot out when Tug stood before his desk, \"all\nI want you to do is answer one question: Was it you who painted the\n_Lucifer's_ hull during the last watch?\"\n\nTug shifted his big feet uncomfortably; but his serene expression did\nnot vanish.\n\n\"Yes sir,\" Tug confessed. \"I did it for the good of all of us. It jes'\nhad to be done, Cap'n Douglas. Because now those witches--\"\n\n\"Mr. Skelly!\" Douglas cut in shakily, \"are you aware that you used\neight-hundred-thousand dollars worth of platinum to paint the ship!\nWhat are you trying to do, man--\" the young skipper's voice rose to a\ncroaked scream--\"buy those damned witches off?\"\n\nTug shuddered visibly at the profane reference to the dreaded Giants of\nthe Pass.\n\n\"I wouldn't talk that way about them, Cap'n,\" he shivered, \"no, sir.\nYou see, the formula for purification includes platinum--that's\naccording to old Joshua MacLevy. But I couldn't find any white paint at\nall. So I jes' had to use--well, what came to hand.\"\n\n\"Which happened to be our cargo of platinum,\" Captain Douglas murmured\nincredulously. He sank into his swivel like a man in a dream. It was\nstill possible, of course, to salvage much of the precious metal from\nthe hull. But doing the job now, while en route, would mean a suicidal\ndelay; while bringing the _Lucifer_ in, festooned as she was, would\nvery likely mean his ticket. Misery seemed to threaten both courses\nequally; but the young skipper felt he had no choice. Somehow--white or\nblack--the _Lucifer_ had to be brought in on schedule.\n\n\"Mr. Jackson,\" Captain Douglas said with forgivable bitterness, \"you\nwill have bo'sun Skelly confined to irons for the remainder of the run.\nWe may all lose our jobs for this, but with him in the holds, we'll at\nleast have a chance to complete the voyage alive!\"\n\n\n\nThe _Lucifer_, now a white spear cleaving the darkness, reacted to\nthe proximity of the Cross Straits like a cat to danger. All flight\nregulations were strictly enforced, by the Captain's special command.\nEvery instrument and delicate warning device was tested out and brought\nup to specifications. The ship took on the grim aspect of a citadel\nprepared to withstand any eventuality.\n\nOnly bo'sun Tug Skelly was idle as the _Lucifer_ neared the Pass. In\nthe tiny cell underdeck, Tug accepted his enforced inactivity with the\nresignation of a martyr. But he learned from Andy, the galley-boy, that\nthe _Lucifer's_ white coat lay still untouched, and that brought him\nsome comfort.\n\n\"There's things about spacin',\" Tug told the boy, as he ate the food\nAndy had brought him, \"that nobody learns in books. Don't make no\nmistake, Andy, edjacation is good--but it ain't everything. Nossir!\"\n\n\"Nuts,\" Andy remarked picking up the fast-emptied tray. \"I've heard\nthat the skipper is gonna have you examined in New York. Says you're\nbugs.\"\n\nTug stared ahead of him and nodded with a long-suffering look. \"People\nwith real knowledge,\" he said slowly, \"is always considered bugs, Andy.\nSure. Look at Mad Old James Flaherty, the man who first reached Moon.\nAnd before him there was a feller named Gally Leo who told everybody\nthe earth moved around the sun--like it does. Everybody thought they\nwas bugs, until it turned out they was _geenyusses_!\"\n\n\"Yeh,\" Andy grunted unimpressed, \"only you _are_ bugs.\"\n\nThe galley-boy's simple but crushing logic left Tug without a reply. He\nmerely growled contemptuously and watched Andy, as the boy leisurely\ngathered his utensils and exited from the cell. Alone, the big bo'sun\nshivered suddenly and sat motionless on his cot as if transfixed. It\nseemed to Tug that through the thick bulkhead before him a low, far-off\nwailing sound was coming--a sound just like the one Old Joshua MacLevy\nhad described. By Tug's private reckoning, the _Lucifer_ was right at\nthe Straits. And that wail could only be--! Despite the careful and\ncostly precaution he had taken against the Witches of the Pass, Tug\nSkelly's eyes began to bulge.\n\nUp on the bridge, a few minutes before, Captain Chris Douglas also\nwitnessed a peculiar thing. It was mate Pete Jackson, at the forward\nsight, who called his attention to it. Douglas reluctantly tore his\ngaze from the gleaming, many-dialed instrument panel before him, and\nanswered the mate's summons.\n\n\"A cloud,\" Jackson frowned. \"Dead ahead.\"\n\nThey were at the lips of the Straits; a few moments more and they would\nbe inside. Captain Douglas glanced hurriedly at the plate. A vague and\nnebulous gray mist was swirling before the ship; but even as he watched\nit, it seemed to melt away and disappear. Douglas quickly volted up\nto maximum the ray-repellers and meteor-deflectors that lined the\n_Lucifer's_ hull.\n\n\"Whatever's in the Straits,\" Chris Douglas said grimly, \"is going to\nbounce right off our hull. The _Lucifer_ was made for heavy weather.\"\n\n\"Sure thing, Capt'n,\" Pete Jackson said wistfully, \"but I can't help\nwishing we were through already!\"\n\n\"We'll get through,\" Douglas said with more confidence than he actually\nfelt. \"The Pass can't be more than twenty-thousand kilos long. We'll be\nout the other side before you can whistle Home Sweet Home.\"\n\n\"I couldn't whistle anything now,\" Pete Jackson sighed as he bent his\nwizened face to the visiplate.\n\nFor a few moments, it looked as if the Captain's optimistic prediction\nmight be justified. The _Lucifer_ was covering almost a thousand\nyards every tenth of a second. It was after about five seconds that\nthe wailing and shrieking noises first came through the hull into the\nbridge.\n\n\"Stars and saints above!\" Pete Jackson stiffened slowly in his\nseat, his little blue eyes engulfed in whiteness. Captain Douglas,\ntoo, jerked nervously at the eerie sounds. But the dials before him\ncontinued to reveal nothing amiss. He shot a quick, hard command to\nkeep the course. The mate obeyed trembling as from ague. A split-second\nlater they were in the Pass.\n\n\n\nThere wasn't any doubt they were in something! A wave of superheated\nsteam seemed to strike the _Lucifer_ simultaneously from all sides. The\nneedle on the tempogauge jerked sharply upward. The pressure oxygen\nin the bridge grew suddenly warm. Captain Douglas and mate sweat in a\ntrice.\n\n\"What's this?\" Pete Jackson started from his seat.\n\n\"Can't tell what it is,\" Captain Douglas frowned before the dials. \"The\ntempogauge is going up, but I don't know why.\"\n\n\"Hah!\" Pete Jackson's laugh broke queerly. \"It couldn't be the hot\nbreath o' Tug Skelly's witches now, could it, Capt'n?\"\n\n\"Witches be blowed!\" Douglas snarled.\n\n\"Still,\" Jackson protested weakly, \"it might be a good idea to turn\nback, even now. That tempo-needle's going up awful fast.\"\n\n\"Hold the course, Mr. Jackson,\" Douglas said angrily. To execute a slow\nturning maneuver at this point would be tantamount to suicide! Jackson\nknew that too, only the mate wasn't using his head any longer. Whatever\ndanger they were in, their best chance was to hold speed and try to\nslip through the Pass before the blistering heat outside melted down\ntheir hull plates.\n\nThe mate steadied in his seat.\n\n\"Give her everything she'll take,\" Captain Douglas ordered the\nengine-room via his speaking-tube. \"Everything!\"\n\n\"_Aye, aye, sir._\" The choked reply from below was followed by a long,\nmuttered oath that almost made young Douglas grin. He called down a\nword of encouragement, and stepped swiftly back to the instrument\npanel. The tempo-needle was mounting in the dangerous red ever closer\nand closer to the hull melting-point. The heat inside the bridge was\ninsufferable by now; the two men, stripped to the waist, their bodies\nshining oilily, could hardly breathe. The shrieking outside had risen\nto a horrendous, deafening clamor. The end, one way or another, could\nscarcely be more than a few seconds off.\n\n\"We can't take much more,\" Pete Jackson gulped miserably. \"She'll open\na seam sure!\"\n\n\"Jackson,\" Douglas said with sudden thought, \"better get Skelly out\nof the hold. If the ship goes, we might have a chance with the\nemergency-dories.\" The thought was futile though, and both men knew it.\nA temperature that could melt the _Lucifer's_ hull would reduce one of\nthe flimsy dories to ash in an instant. Nevertheless, Jackson got to\nhis feet. But, before he could take a step, something in the port sight\ncaught the mate's eye. Pete Jackson slowly stiffened until he stood\nrigid and pallid as a corpse.\n\n\"Capt'n Douglas!\" Jackson cried in the weak and despairing voice of a\nman whose innermost dread is all too horribly realized. \"_There's the\nwitch!_\"\n\n\n\nWith an impatient frown, Douglas sprang to the port plate where the\nmate's gaze was transfixed. But the vision that met the skipper brought\nhim up in his tracks. An icy chill trickled down Chris Douglas's spine\ndespite the terrible heat around him. A great black shape, long as the\n_Lucifer_ herself, loomed beside them; half-shrouded in mist, huge\nfunereal form now rode alongside the freighter, so close that hissing\nsparks from the _Lucifer's_ steaming plates sprayed it. Like some\ngrim and timely escort from beyond, the apparition kept pace with the\nstricken white ship.\n\n\"Merciful Mary!\" Pete Jackson gasped incoherently. \"We're done for now,\nCapt'n!\"\n\nDouglas ran a dazed hand over his sweat-ridden eyes, opening them\nwider. Then, even as he watched, the black shape began to turn slowly,\nfalling back from the hurtling _Lucifer_. Only then could he see it\nfully. A cry of astonishment broke from the skipper as he recognized\nthe thing for what it was. This Witch of the Pass was the gaunt and\ncharred corpse of an ether-blaster, whose orbit lay round and round\ninside the Straits that had destroyed it. Like a mute, accusing ghost,\nthe old ship was forever destined to haunt the narrow scene of its\nmurder.\n\nNo wonder that for an instant he had half-believed the Straits\nbewitched! The sight outside wasn't very pleasant. Nor was it\ncomforting to think that the _Lucifer_ might yet join that lonely\nvigil. Captain Douglas turned from the plate and choked an angry oath\nback at the searing heat around him.\n\n\"Get Skelly,\" he snapped to Jackson; but the mate was clearly in no\ncondition to obey. Pete Jackson still stood like a man who has looked\ninto the inferno and is only awaiting the summons of a ghastly tap on\nthe shoulder. Douglas scowled, blinked the sweat from his eyes, and\nstarted to exit himself. It didn't seem to make much difference, but he\ncouldn't let the bo'sun perish like a caged rat.\n\nHowever, he didn't leave the bridge. Something on the instrument\npanel gave Captain Douglas the sudden hope that he might be able to\nlet Skelly stay where he was. The tempo-needle had halted its upward\nswing. The tiny arrow hovered motionless a hair's breadth from the hull\nmelting-point; but it did not advance. As he watched it, the needle\nbegan to retreat, imperceptibly at first; then faster. Douglas jumped\nincredulously to the forward plate.\n\nThe twilighted expanse before the _Lucifer_ was wide, frosty and\nmarvelously clear. The mists had disappeared. They were through! The\nCaptain's call brought mate Jackson up from his seat and all the way\nacross the bridge in two jumps.\n\n\"Praise be!\" Pete Jackson blinked joyfully into the sight. \"It's a\nmiracle--that's what it is!\"\n\n\"A miracle, my big toe!\" was Captain Douglas's very unskipperish\nretort. A thought which might explain the _Lucifer's_ narrow escape\nfrom the fate of the charred ether-blaster, was forming in the\nskipper's mind. It was a thought which gained credence when Douglas\nquickly tested the contents of a vial in the bridge. The glass\nreceptacle was filled with a sampling of the misty vapor in the Straits.\n\n\"Look at this,\" Douglas called the mate to him. Jackson peered at\nthe results of the test, incredulously at first; then with an abject\nexpression as he realized what it meant. Captain Douglas's further\nexplanation did not make the little mate feel any happier.\n\n\"I just don't know what happened to me,\" Pete Jackson shook his head.\n\"First those infernal shrieks and then that old oxy-burner back\nthere--\" The mate broke off with a woeful, contrite look.\n\n\"I know, Pete,\" Douglas grinned with a mock shudder. \"Seeing that old\nhulk had me believing in ghosts for a while myself. Anyway, it's\nover and we're damned lucky. It's double rations all around at mess\ntonight. And I think we'll get Skelly out of the brig. He's probably so\novercooked by now that he doesn't need any more punishing. Besides, I\nwant to talk to him.\"\n\nAnd Chris Douglas offered the mate a significant look which made\nJackson brighten up considerably as he grinned back in understanding.\n\n\n\n\"So you see, Skelly,\"--several hours later Captain Douglas summed up\nthe points of the simple but precise lecture in his cabin: \"The myth of\nthe Twin Witches can be altogether explained by the facts on hand now.\nThe real danger in the Straits was--air. Plain dust-filled air. A wide\ncolumn of it circulates about the Pass at better than gale velocity.\nThat, and nothing else, accounts for the howling noises.\"\n\nThe _Lucifer's_ skipper addressed his bo'sun in the presence of mate\nJackson and a few other crew members. Tug Skelly's great face, as\nhe listened, was the livid hue of broiled lobster. The heat in his\nlittle cell _had_ been terrific. But no gleam of enlightenment lit the\nbo'sun's eyes as the Captain spoke. Tug's only reaction was a rather\nmistrustful frown.\n\n\"It's clear,\" Douglas went on carefully, \"that the old ships that tried\nthe Straits were charred instantly by the terrible friction set up when\nthey struck the air. The same thing would have happened to us, if it\nhadn't been for the platinum on our hull.\"\n\nTug's face brightened with that; but his grin cost him such pain that\nhe gulped hard and swallowed it down. In the little room, his swollen,\nflaming countenance flared like a great beacon.\n\n\"Sure, Cap'n,\" Tug nodded as he managed an imperceptible smile. \"I told\nyou we'd get through all right if yuh left it to me.\"\n\n\"Now, listen,\" Douglas said a trifle testily, \"the platinum didn't do a\nthing but insulate our hull from the heat. Don't you see? It was just\nenough to keep the plates from melting. Platinum can't be oxidized--it\ncan't be burnt! And that's what saved our lives. You see it now, don't\nyou, Skelly?\"\n\n\"Yessir, Cap'n,\" Tug frowned. \"I get what you're drivin' at.\" The\nbig bo'sun did seem to be making an effort to understand the simple\nmechanics that underlay their escape. And that, Captain Douglas felt,\nwas a momentous step in the right direction.\n\n\"Good!\" Captain Christopher Douglas said with feeling. He relaxed\nand looked about him with a pleased smile. Another convert had been\nled from darkness into the light of truth and science. It was not\nevery day that Chris Douglas was privileged to rescue some poor,\nsuperstition-ridden soul. A sense of warm beneficence filled the young\nskipper. But he had another reason, besides the fact that the _Lucifer_\nwas now certain to fetch New York on schedule, to congratulate himself.\n\n\"I've got good news for you, Skelly,\" Douglas smiled; \"you'll be glad\nto learn that the platinum you used on the hull was caked by the heat;\nand it is almost a hundred-percent recoverable.\"\n\n\"That's jes' fine!\" Tug said with much relief. \"I was sort of worried\nabout that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Douglas went on pointedly but not unkindly, \"and since it was\nyour boner in Orion City that got us into the mess in the first place,\nI have decided, Skelly, that you're going to do the recovering, by\nyourself! However, once the platinum is back in the hold we'll call all\naccounts square. How is that?\"\n\n\"Me, Cap'n? Myself?\" Tug's singed eyebrows went up in surprised\ndisappointment. It was clear the bo'sun had expected a different kind\nof reward for the part he played in traversing the dread Pass. Tug\nscratched his head wryly. \"It's OK I guess,\" he sighed.\n\n\"You've got three days,\" Douglas said, \"before we arrive in New York to\ndo the job. That's providing you start at once. I think you'd better\nget your bulger and go out on the hull right now--unless--\" the Captain\nsmiled a little--\"unless you're still afraid of those witches, Skelly.\"\n\nThe Captain bantered easily. The light of science brightened every\ncorner of the cabin now. The darkness was a thing of the past. It was\nimpossible even to think of witches without snickering. However, the\npainful grin on Tug Skelly's face was hardly a snicker; rather it was a\nsly and knowing grin.\n\n\"No sir! Cap'n,\" Tug scoffed heavily. \"Not me! I never was afraid o'\nthose witches on account of myself--it was the rest of the crew I was\nthinkin' about all along! Yessir. Y'see, I had _this_ all the time,\nCap'n.\"\n\nTug drew from his huge bosom a tiny, bedraggled object that hung by a\ncord from his neck. With some pride, he exhibited his possession to\nCaptain Douglas who stared puzzledly at the little, shapeless thing.\nBut before Douglas could examine it, the bo'sun tucked it back inside\nhis shirt and saluted with as much vigor as his par-boiled frame would\nallow.\n\n\"Yessir!\" Tug Skelly announced confidently. \"I'll have that platinum\nback in the hold before morning mess.\"\n\nIt wasn't until the group had followed Tug Skelly out of the cabin,\nleaving him alone, that Captain Douglas realized what the bo'sun had\nheld up in his gnarled palm. The realization made the young skipper\nsigh heavily and sink back into his seat. The victory of science\nover bo'sun Tug Skelly was not destined to be an easy one. Tug was\ngoing bravely out onto the _Lucifer's_ hull armed with an old and\nmuch-used--rabbit's foot!\n\n\n\n\n",
