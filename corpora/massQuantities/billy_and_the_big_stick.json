    "body": "Had the Wilmot Electric Light people remained content only to make\nlight, had they not, as a by-product, attempted to make money, they need\nnot have left Hayti.\n\nWhen they flooded with radiance the unpaved streets of Port-au-Prince no\none, except the police, who complained that the lights kept them awake,\nmade objection; but when for this illumination the Wilmot Company\ndemanded payment, every one up to President Hamilear Poussevain was\nsurprised and grieved. So grieved was President Ham, as he was lovingly\ndesignated, that he withdrew the Wilmot concession, surrounded the\npower-house with his barefooted army, and in a proclamation announced\nthat for the future the furnishing of electric light would be a monopoly\nof the government.\n\nIn Hayti, as soon as it begins to make money, any industry, native or\nforeign, becomes a monopoly of the government. The thing works\nautomatically. It is what in Hayti is understood as _haute_ finance. The\nWilmot people should have known that. Because they did not know that,\nthey stood to lose what they had sunk in the electric-light plant, and\nafter their departure to New York, which departure was accelerated as\nfar as the wharf by seven generals and twelve privates, they proceeded\nto lose more money on lobbyists and lawyers who claimed to understand\ninternational law; even the law of Hayti. And lawyers who understand\nthat are high-priced.\n\nThe only employee of the Wilmot force who was not escorted to the wharf\nunder guard was Billy Barlow. He escaped the honor because he was\nsuperintendent of the power-house, and President Ham believed that\nwithout him the lightning would not strike. Accordingly by an executive\norder Billy became an employee of the government. With this arrangement\nthe Wilmot people were much pleased. For they trusted Billy, and they\nknew while in the courts they were righting to regain their property,\nhe would see no harm came to it.\n\nBilly\u2019s title was Directeur General et Inspecteur Municipal de Luminaire\nElectrique, which is some title, and his salary was fifty dollars a\nweek. In spite of Billy\u2019s color President Ham always treated his only\nwhite official with courtesy and gave him his full title. About giving\nhim his full salary he was less particular. This neglect greatly annoyed\nBilly. He came of sturdy New England stock and possessed that New\nEngland conscience which makes the owner a torment to himself, and to\nevery one else a nuisance. Like all the other Barlows of Barnstable on\nCape Cod, Billy had worked for his every penny. He was no shirker. From\nthe first day that he carried a pair of pliers in the leg pocket of his\noveralls, and in a sixty-knot gale stretched wires between ice-capped\ntele graph poles, he had more than earned his wages. Never, whether on\ntime or at piece-work, had he by a slovenly job, or by beating the\nwhistle, robbed his employer. And for his honest toil he was determined\nto be as honestly paid--even by President Hamilcar Poussevain. And\nPresident Ham never paid anybody; neither the Armenian street peddlers,\nin whose sweets he delighted, nor the Bethlehem Steel Company, nor the\nhouse of Rothschild.\n\nWhy he paid Billy even the small sums that from time to time Billy wrung\nfrom the president\u2019s strong box the foreign colony were at a loss to\nexplain. Wagner, the new American consul, asked Billy how he managed it.\nAs an American minister had not yet been appointed to the duties of the\nconsul, as Wagner assured everybody, were added those of diplomacy. But\nHaytian diplomacy he had yet to master. At the seaport in Scotland where\nhe had served as vice-consul, law and order were as solidly established\nas the stone jetties, and by contrast the eccentricities of the Black\nREPUBLIC baffled and distressed him.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that you blackmail the president,\u201d said the consul,\n\u201cbecause I understand he boasts he has committed all the known crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd several he invented,\u201d agreed Billy.\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t do it with a gun, because they tell me the president\nisn\u2019t afraid of anything except a voodoo priestess. What is your\nsecret?\u201d coaxed the consul. \u201cIf you\u2019ll only sell it, I know several\nPowers that would give you your price.\u201d Billy smiled modestly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time my wages were shy I went to\nthe palace and told him if he didn\u2019t come across I\u2019d shut off the juice.\nI think he was so stunned at anybody asking him for real money that\nwhile he was still stunned he opened his safe and handed me two thousand\nfrancs. I think he did it more in admiration for my nerve than because\nhe owed it. The next time pay-day arrived, and the pay did not, I didn\u2019t\ngo to the palace. I just went to bed, and the lights went to bed, too.\nYou may remember?\u201d The consul snorted indignantly.\n\n\u201cI was holding three queens at the time,\u201d he protested. \u201cWas it YOU did\nthat?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was,\u201d said Billy. \u201cThe police came for me to start the current going\nagain, but I said I was too ill. Then the president\u2019s own doctor came,\nold Gautier, and Gautier examined me with a lantern and said that in\nHayti my disease frequently proved fatal, but he thought if I turned on\nthe lights I might recover. I told him I was tired of life, anyway, but\nthat if I could see three thousand francs it might give me an incentive.\nHe reported back to the president and the three thousand francs arrived\nalmost instantly, and a chicken broth from Ham\u2019s own chef, with His\nExcellency\u2019s best wishes for the recovery of the invalid. My recovery\nwas instantaneous, and I switched on the lights.\n\n\u201cI had just moved into the Widow Ducrot\u2019s hotel that week, and her\ndaughter Claire wouldn\u2019t let me eat the broth. I thought it was because,\nas she\u2019s a dandy cook herself, she was professionally jealous. She put\nthe broth on the top shelf of the pantry and wrote on a piece of paper,\n\u2018Gare!\u2019 But the next morning a perfectly good cat, who apparently\ncouldn\u2019t read, was lying beside it dead.\u201d\n\nThe consul frowned reprovingly.\n\n\u201cYou should not make such reckless charges,\u201d he protested. \u201cI would call\nit only a coincidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can call it what you please,\u201d said Billy, \u201cbut it won\u2019t bring the\ncat back. Anyway, the next time I went to the palace to collect, the\npresident was ready for me. He said he\u2019d been taking out information,\nand he found if I shut off the lights again he could hire another man\nin the States to turn them on. I told him he\u2019d been deceived. I told him\nthe Wilmot Electric Lights were produced by a secret process, and that\nonly a trained Wilmot man could work them. And I pointed out to him\nif he dismissed me it wasn\u2019t likely the Wilmot people would loan him\nanother expert; not while they were fighting him through the courts\nand the State Department. That impressed the old man; so I issued my\nultimatum. I said if he must have electric lights he must have me, too.\nWhether he liked it or not, mine was a life job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he say to that?\u201d gasped the new consul.\n\n\u201cSaid it wasn\u2019t a life job, because he was going to have me shot at\nsunset.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you said?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said if he did that there wouldn\u2019t be any electric lights, and you\nwould bring a warship and shoot Hayti off the map.\u201d\n\nThe new consul was most indignant.\n\n\u201cYou had no right to say that!\u201d he protested. \u201cYou did very ill. My\ninstructions are to avoid all serious complications.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was what I was trying to avoid,\u201d said Billy. \u201cDon\u2019t you call\nbeing shot at sunset a serious complication? Or would that be just a\ncoincidence, too? You\u2019re a hellofa consul!\u201d\n\nSince his talk with the representative of his country four months had\npassed and Billy still held his job. But each month the number of francs\nhe was able to wrest from President Hamilcar dwindled, and were won only\nafter verbal conflicts that each month increased in violence.\n\nTo the foreign colony it became evident that, in the side of President\nHam, Billy was a thorn, sharp, irritating, virulent, and that at any\nmoment Ham might pluck that thorn and Billy would leave Hayti in haste,\nand probably in hand-cuffs. This was evident to Billy, also, and the\nprospect was most disquieting. Not because he loved Hayti, but because\nsince he went to lodge at the cafe of the Widow Ducrot, he had learned\nto love her daughter Claire, and Claire loved him.\n\nOn the two thousand dollars due him from Ham they plotted to marry. This\nwas not as great an adventure as it might appear. Billy knew that from\nthe Wilmot people he always was sure of a salary, and one which, with\nsuch an excellent housekeeper as was Claire, would support them both.\nBut with his two thousand dollars as capital they could afford to\nplunge; they could go upon a honeymoon; they need not dread a rainy day,\nand, what was of greatest importance, they need not delay. There was\ngood reason against delay, for the hand of the beautiful Claire was\nalready promised. The Widow Ducrot had promised it to Paillard, he of\nthe prosperous commission business, the prominent EMBONPOINT, and four\nchildren. Monsieur Paillard possessed an establishment of his own, but\nit was a villa in the suburbs; and so, each day at noon, for his DEJEUNE\nhe left his office and crossed the street to the Cafe Ducrot. For five\nyears this had been his habit. At first it was the widow\u2019s cooking that\nattracted him, then for a time the widow herself; but when from the\nconvent Claire came to assist her mother in the cafe, and when from a\nlanky, big-eyed, long-legged child she grew into a slim, joyous, and\ncharming young woman, she alone was the attraction, and the Widower\nPaillard decided to make her his wife. Other men had made the same\ndecision; and when it was announced that between Claire and the widower\na marriage had been \u201carranged,\u201d the clerks in the foreign commission\nhouses and the agents of the steamship lines drowned their sorrow in\nrum and ran the house flags to half-staff. Paillard himself took the\nproposed alliance calmly. He was not an impetuous suitor. With Widow\nDucrot he agreed that Claire was still too young to marry, and to\nhimself kept the fact that to remarry he was in no haste. In his mind\ndoubts still lingered. With a wife, young enough to be one of his\nchildren, disorganizing, the routine of his villa, would it be any more\ncomfortable than he now found it? Would his eldest daughter and her\nstepmother dwell together in harmony? The eldest daughter had assured\nhim that so far as she was concerned they would not; and, after all, in\nmarrying a girl, no matter how charming, without a dot, and the daughter\nof a boarding-house keeper, no matter how respectable, was he not\ndisposing of himself too cheaply? These doubts assailed Papa Paillard;\nthese speculations were in his mind. And while he speculated Billy\nacted.\n\n\u201cI know that in France,\u201d Billy assured Claire, \u201cmarriages are arranged\nby the parents; but in my country they are arranged in heaven. And who\nare we to disregard the edicts of heaven? Ages and ages ago, before the\nflood, before Napoleon, even before old Paillard with his four children,\nit was arranged in heaven that you were to marry me. So, what little\nplans your good mother may make don\u2019t cut enough ice to cool a green\nmint. Now, we can\u2019t try to get married here,\u201d continued Billy, \u201cwithout\nyour mother and Paillard knowing it. In this town as many people have to\nsign the marriage contract as signed our Declaration of Independence:\nall the civil authorities, all the clergy, all the relatives; if every\nman in the telephone book isn\u2019t a witness, the marriage doesn\u2019t \u2018take.\u2019\nSo, we must elope!\u201d\n\nHaving been brought up in a convent, where she was taught to obey\nher mother and forbidden to think of marriage, Claire was naturally\ndelighted with the idea of an elopement.\n\n\u201cTo where will we elope to?\u201d she demanded. Her English, as she learned\nit from Billy, was sometimes confusing.\n\n\u201cTo New York,\u201d said Billy. \u201cOn the voyage there I will put you in charge\nof the stewardess and the captain; and there isn\u2019t a captain on the\nRoyal Dutch or the Atlas that hasn\u2019t known you since you were a baby.\nAnd as soon as we dock we\u2019ll drive straight to the city hall for a\nlicense and the mayor himself will marry us. Then I\u2019ll get back my old\njob from the Wilmot folks and we\u2019ll live happy ever after!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn New York, also,\u201d asked Claire proudly, \u201care you directeur of the\nelectric lights?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Broadway alone,\u201d Billy explained reprovingly, \u201cthere is one sign\nthat uses more bulbs than there are in the whole of Hayti!\u201d\n\n\u201cNew York is a large town!\u201d exclaimed Claire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a large sign,\u201d corrected Billy. \u201cBut,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cwith no\nmoney we\u2019ll never see it. So to-morrow I\u2019m going to make a social call\non Grandpa Ham and demand my ten thousand francs.\u201d Claire grasped his\narm.\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cRemember the chicken soup. If he offers you\nthe champagne, refuse it!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t offer me the champagne,\u201d Billy assured her. \u201cIt won\u2019t be that\nkind of a call.\u201d\n\nBilly left the Cafe Ducrot and made his way to the water-front. He was\nexpecting some electrical supplies by the PRINZ DER NEDERLANDEN, and she\nhad already come to anchor.\n\nHe was late, and save for a group of his countrymen, who with the\ncustoms officials were having troubles of their own, the customs shed\nwas all but deserted. Billy saw his freight cleared and was going away\nwhen one of those in trouble signalled for assistance.\n\nHe was a good-looking young man in a Panama hat and his manner seemed\nto take it for granted that Billy knew who he was. \u201cThey want us to pay\nduty on our trunks,\u201d he explained, \u201cand we want to leave them in bond.\nWe\u2019ll be here only until to-night, when we\u2019re going on down the coast\nto Santo Domingo. But we don\u2019t speak French, and we can\u2019t make them\nunderstand that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to speak any language to give a man ten dollars,\u201d said\nBilly.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d exclaimed the man in the Panama. \u201cI was afraid if I tried that\nthey might arrest us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may arrest you if you don\u2019t,\u201d said Billy. Acting both as\ninterpreter and disbursing agent, Billy satisfied the demands of\nhis fellow employees of the government, and his fellow countrymen he\ndirected to the Hotel Ducrot.\n\nAs some one was sure to take their money, he thought it might as well\ngo to his mother-in-law elect. The young man in the Panama expressed\nthe deepest gratitude, and Billy, assuring him he would see him later,\ncontinued to the power-house, still wondering where he had seen him\nbefore.\n\nAt the power-house he found seated at his desk a large, bearded stranger\nwhose derby hat and ready-to-wear clothes showed that he also had but\njust arrived on the PRINZ DER NEDERLANDEN.\n\n\u201cYou William Barlow?\u201d demanded the stranger. \u201cI understand you been\nthreatening, unless you get your pay raised, to commit sabotage on these\nworks?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho the devil are you?\u201d inquired Billy.\n\nThe stranger produced an impressive-looking document covered with seals.\n\n\u201cContract with the president,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken over your job. You\nbetter get out quiet,\u201d he advised, \u201cas they\u2019ve given me a squad of\nnigger policemen to see that you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you aware that these works are the property of the Wilmot Company?\u201d\n asked Billy, \u201cand that if anything went wrong here they\u2019d hold you\nresponsible?\u201d The stranger smiled complacently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve run plants,\u201d he said, \u201cthat make these lights look like a stable\nlantern on a foggy night.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d assented Billy, \u201cshould anything happen, you\u2019ll know\nexactly what to do, and I can leave you in charge without feeling the\nleast anxiety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what you can do,\u201d the stranger agreed heartily, \u201cand you\ncan\u2019t do it too quick!\u201d From the desk he took Billy\u2019s favorite pipe and\nloaded it from Billy\u2019s tobacco-jar. But when Billy had reached the door\nhe called to him. \u201cBefore you go, son,\u201d he said \u201cyou might give me a tip\nabout this climate. I never been in the tropics. It\u2019s kind of unhealthy,\nain\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHis expression was one of concern.\n\n\u201cIf you hope to keep alive,\u201d began Billy, \u201cthere are two things to\navoid----\u201d The stranger laughed knowingly.\n\n\u201cI got you!\u201d he interrupted. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me to cut out wine\nand women.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to tell you,\u201d said Billy, \u201cto cut out hoping to collect any\nwages and to avoid every kind of soup.\u201d\n\nFrom the power-house Billy went direct to the palace. His anxiety was\ngreat. Now that Claire had consented to leave Hayti, the loss of his\nposition did not distress him. But the possible loss of his back pay\nwould be a catastrophe. He had hardly enough money to take them both\nto New York, and after they arrived none with which to keep them alive.\nBefore the Wilmot Company could find a place for him a month might pass,\nand during that month they might starve. If he went alone and arranged\nfor Claire to follow, he might lose her. Her mother might marry her to\nPaillard; Claire might fall ill; without him at her elbow to keep her to\ntheir purpose the voyage to an unknown land might require more courage\nthan she possessed. Billy saw it was imperative they should depart\ntogether, and to that end he must have his two thousand dollars. The\nmoney was justly his. For it he had sweated and slaved; had given\nhis best effort. And so, when he faced the president, he was in no\nconciliatory mood. Neither was the president.\n\nBy what right, he demanded, did this foreigner affront his ears with\ndemands for money; how dared he force his way into his presence and\nto his face babble of back pay? It was insolent, incredible. With\nindignation the president set forth the position of the government:\nBilly had been discharged and, with the appointment of his successor,\nthe stranger in the derby hat, had ceased to exist. The government could\nnot pay money to some one who did not exist. All indebtedness to Billy\nalso had ceased to exist. The account had been wiped out. Billy had been\nwiped out. The big negro, with the chest and head of a gorilla, tossed\nhis kinky white curls so violently that the ringlets danced. Billy, he\ndeclared, had been a pest; a fly that buzzed and buzzed and disturbed\nhis slumbers. And now when the fly thought he slept he had caught and\ncrushed it-so. President Ham clinched his great fist convulsively and,\nwith delight in his pantomime, opened his fingers one by one, and held\nout his pink palm, wrinkled and crossed like the hand of a washerwoman,\nas though to show Billy that in it lay the fly, dead.\n\n\u201cC\u2019EST UNE CHOSE JUGEE!\u201d thundered the president. He reached for his\nquill pen.\n\nBut Billy, with Claire in his heart, with the injustice of it rankling\nin his mind, did not agree.\n\n\u201cIt is not an affair closed,\u201d shouted Billy in his best French. \u201cIt is\nan affair international, diplomatic; a cause for war!\u201d\n\nBelieving he had gone mad, President Ham gazed at him speechless.\n\n\u201cFrom here I go to the cable Office,\u201d shouted Billy. \u201cI cable for a\nwarship! If, by to-night, I am not paid my money, marines will\nsurround our power-house, and the Wilmot people will back me up, and my\ngovernment will back me up!\u201d\n\nIt was, so Billy thought, even as he launched it, a tirade satisfying\nand magnificent. But in his turn the president did not agree.\n\nHe rose. He was a large man. Billy wondered he had not previously\nnoticed how very large he was.\n\n\u201cTo-night at nine o\u2019clock,\u201d he said, \u201cthe German boat departs for New\nYork.\u201d As though aiming a pistol, he raised his arm and at Billy pointed\na finger. \u201cIf, after she departs, you are found in Port-au-Prince, you\nwill be shot!\u201d\n\nThe audience-chamber was hung with great mirrors in frames of tarnished\ngilt. In these Billy saw himself reproduced in a wavering line of\nBillies that, like the ghost of Banquo, stretched to the disappearing\npoint. Of such images there was an army, but of the real Billy, as he\nwas acutely conscious, there was but one. Among the black faces scowling\nfrom the doorways he felt the odds were against him. Without making a\nreply he passed out between the racks of rusty muskets in the anteroom,\nbetween the two Gatling guns guarding the entrance, and on the palace\nsteps, in indecision, halted.\n\nAs Billy hesitated an officer followed him from the palace and beckoned\nto the guard that sat in the bare dust of the Champ de Mars playing\ncards for cartridges. Two abandoned the game, and, having received their\norders, picked their muskets from the dust and stood looking expectantly\nat Billy.\n\nThey were his escort, and it was evident that until nine o\u2019clock, when\nhe sailed, his movements would be spied upon; his acts reported to the\npresident.\n\nSuch being the situation, Billy determined that his first act to be\nreported should be of a nature to cause the president active mental\nanguish. With his guard at his heels he went directly to the cable\nstation, and to the Secretary of State of the United States addressed\nthis message: \u201cPresident refuses my pay; threatens shoot; wireless\nnearest war-ship proceed here full speed. William Barlow.\u201d\n\nBilly and the director of telegraphs, who out of office hours was a\nfield-marshal, and when not in his shirt-sleeves always appeared in\nuniform, went over each word of the cablegram together. When Billy was\nassured that the field-marshal had grasped the full significance of it\nhe took it back and added, \u201cLove to Aunt Maria.\u201d The extra words cost\nfour dollars and eighty cents gold, but, as they suggested ties of blood\nbetween himself and the Secretary of State, they seemed advisable.\nIn the account-book in which he recorded his daily expenditures Billy\ncredited the item to \u201clife-insurance.\u201d\n\nThe revised cablegram caused the field-marshal deep concern. He frowned\nat Billy ferociously.\n\n\u201cI will forward this at once,\u201d he promised. \u201cBut, I warn you,\u201d he added,\n\u201cI deliver also a copy to MY president!\u201d\n\nBilly sighed hopefully.\n\n\u201cYou might deliver the copy first,\u201d he suggested.\n\nFrom the cable station Billy, still accompanied by his faithful\nretainers, returned to the power-house. There he bade farewell to the\nblack brothers who had been his assistants, and upon one of them pressed\na sum of money.\n\nAs they parted, this one, as though giving the password of a secret\nsociety, chanted solemnly:\n\n\u201cA HUIT HEURES JUSTE!\u201d And Billy clasped his hand and nodded.\n\nAt the office of the Royal Dutch West India Line Billy purchased a\nticket to New York and inquired were there many passengers. \u201cThe ship is\nempty,\u201d said the agent.\n\n\u201cI am glad,\u201d said Billy, \u201cfor one of my assistants may come with me. He\nalso is being deported.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have as many cabins as you want,\u201d said the agent. \u201cWe are so\nsorry to see you go that we will try to make you feel you leave us on\nyour private yacht.\u201d\n\nThe next two hours Billy spent in seeking out those acquaintances\nfrom whom he could borrow money. He found that by asking for it in\nhomoeopathic doses he was able to shame the foreign colony into loaning\nhim all of one hundred dollars. This, with what he had in hand, would\ntake Claire and himself to New York and for a week keep them alive.\nAfter that he must find work or they must starve.\n\nIn the garden of the Cafe Ducrot Billy placed his guard at a table with\nbottles of beer between them, and at an \u2018adjoining table with Claire\nplotted the elopement for that night. The garden was in the rear of the\nhotel and a door in the lower wall opened into the rue Cambon, that led\ndirectly to the water-front.\n\nBilly proposed that at eight o\u2019clock Claire should be waiting in the rue\nCambon outside this door. They would then make their way to one of the\nless frequented wharfs, where Claire would arrange to have a rowboat in\nreadiness, and in it they would take refuge on the steamer. An hour\nlater, before the flight of Claire could be discovered, they would have\nstarted on their voyage to the mainland.\n\n\u201cI warn you,\u201d said Billy, \u201cthat after we reach New York I have only\nenough to keep us for a week. It will be a brief honey-moon. After that\nwe will probably starve. I\u2019m not telling you this to discourage you,\u201d he\nexplained; \u201conly trying to be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would rather starve with you in New York,\u201d said Claire, \u201cthan die\nhere without you.\u201d\n\nAt these words Billy desired greatly to kiss Claire, but the guards were\nscowling at him. It was not until Claire had gone to her room to pack\nher bag and the chance to kiss her had passed that Billy recognized that\nthe scowls were intended to convey the fact that the beer bottles were\nempty. He remedied this and remained alone at his table considering the\nout look. The horizon was, indeed, gloomy, and the only light upon it,\nthe loyalty and love of the girl, only added to his bitterness. Above\nall things he desired to make her content, to protect her from disquiet,\nto convince her that in the sacrifice she was making she also was\nplotting her own happiness. Had he been able to collect his ten thousand\nfrancs his world would have danced in sunshine. As it was, the heavens\nwere gray and for the future the skies promised only rainy days. In\nthese de pressing reflections Billy was interrupted by the approach of\nthe young man in the Panama hat. Billy would have avoided him, but the\nyoung man and his two friends would not be denied. For the service Billy\nhad rendered them they wished to express their gratitude. It found\nexpression in the form of Planter\u2019s punch. As they consumed this Billy\nexplained to the strangers why the customs men had detained them.\n\n\u201cYou told them you were leaving to-night for Santo Domingo,\u201d said Billy;\n\u201cbut they knew that was impossible, for there is no steamer down the\ncoast for two weeks.\u201d\n\nThe one whose features seemed familiar replied:\n\n\u201cStill, we are leaving to-night,\u201d he said; \u201cnot on a steamer, but on a\nwar-ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cA war-ship?\u201d cried Billy. His heart beat at high speed. \u201cThen,\u201d he\nexclaimed, \u201cyou are a naval officer?\u201d\n\nThe young man shook his head and, as though challenging Billy to make\nanother guess, smiled.\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d Billy complied eagerly, \u201cyou are a diplomat! Are you our new\nminister?\u201d\n\nOne of the other young men exclaimed reproachfully:\n\n\u201cYou know him perfectly well!\u201d he protested. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen his picture\nthousands of times.\u201d\n\nWith awe and pride he placed his hand on Billy\u2019s arm and with the other\npointed at the one in the Panama hat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Harry St. Clair,\u201d he announced. \u201cHarry St. Clair, the King of the\nMovies!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe King of the Movies,\u201d repeated Billy. His disappointment was so keen\nas to be embarrassing.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cI thought you----\u201d Then he remembered his manners.\n\u201cGlad to meet you,\u201d he said. \u201cSeen you on the screen.\u201d\n\nAgain his own troubles took precedence. \u201cDid you say,\u201d he demanded, \u201cOne\nof our war-ships is coming here TO-DAY?\u201d\n\n\u201cComing to take me to Santo Domingo,\u201d explained Mr. St. Clair. He spoke\nairily, as though to him as a means of locomotion battle-ships were\nas trolley-cars. The Planter\u2019s punch, which was something he had\nnever before encountered, encouraged the great young man to unbend. He\nexplained further and fully, and Billy, his mind intent upon his own\naffair, pretended to listen.\n\nThe United States Government, Mr. St. Clair explained, was assisting him\nand the Apollo Film Company in producing the eight-reel film entitled\n\u201cThe Man Behind the Gun.\u201d\n\nWith it the Navy Department plotted to advertise the navy and encourage\nrecruiting. In moving pictures, in the form of a story, with love\ninterest, villain, comic relief, and thrills, it would show the life of\nAmerican bluejackets afloat and ashore, at home and abroad. They would\nbe seen at Yokohama playing baseball with Tokio University; in the\ncourtyard of the Vatican receiving the blessing of the Pope; at Waikiki\nriding the breakers on a scrubbing-board; in the Philippines eating\ncocoanuts in the shade of the sheltering palm, and in Brooklyn in the\nY. M. C. A. club, in the shadow of the New York sky-scrapers, playing\nbilliards and reading the sporting extras.\n\nAs it would be illustrated on the film the life of \u201cThe Man Behind the\nGun\u201d was one of luxurious ease. In it coal-passing, standing watch in a\nblizzard, and washing down decks, cold and unsympathetic, held no part.\nBut to prove that the life of Jack was not all play he would be seen\nfighting for the flag. That was where, as \u201cLieutenant Hardy, U. S. A.,\u201d\n the King of the Movies entered.\n\n\u201cOur company arrived in Santo Domingo last week,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd\nthey\u2019re waiting for me now. I\u2019m to lead the attack on the fortress. We\nland in shore boats under the guns of the ship and I take the fortress.\nFirst, we show the ship clearing for action and the men lowering the\nboats and pulling for shore. Then we cut back to show the gun-crews\nserving the guns. Then we jump to the landing-party wading through the\nbreakers. I lead them. The man who is carrying the flag gets shot and\ndrops in the surf. I pick him up, put him on my shoulder, and carry him\nand the flag to the beach, where----\u201d\n\nBilly suddenly awoke. His tone was one of excited interest.\n\n\u201cYou got a uniform?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\u201cThree,\u201d said St. Clair impressively, \u201cmade to order according to\nregulations on file in the Quartermaster\u2019s Department. Each absolutely\ncorrect.\u201d Without too great a show of eagerness he inquired: \u201cLike to\nsee them?\u201d\n\nWithout too great a show of eagerness Billy assured him that he would.\n\n\u201cI got to telephone first,\u201d he added, \u201cbut by the time you get your\ntrunk open I\u2019ll join you in your room.\u201d\n\nIn the cafe, over the telephone, Billy addressed himself to the\nfield-marshal in charge of the cable office. When Billy gave his name,\nthe voice of that dignitary became violently agitated.\n\n\u201cMonsieur Barlow,\u201d he demanded, \u201cdo you know that the war-ship for which\nyou cabled your Secretary of State makes herself to arrive?\u201d\n\nAt the other end of the \u2018phone, although restrained by the confines of\nthe booth, Billy danced joyously. But his voice was stern.\n\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhere is she now?\u201d\n\nAn hour before, so the field-marshal informed him, the battle-ship\nLOUISIANA had been sighted and by telegraph reported. She was\napproaching under forced draft. At any moment she might anchor in the\nouter harbor. Of this President Ham had been informed. He was grieved,\nindignant; he was also at a loss to understand.\n\n\u201cIt is very simple,\u201d explained Billy. \u201cShe probably was somewhere in\nthe Windward Passage. When the Secretary got my message he cabled\nGuantanamo, and Guantanamo wired the war-ship nearest Port-au-Prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Poussevain,\u201d warned the field marshal, \u201cis greatly disturbed.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him not to worry,\u201d said Billy. \u201cTell him when the bombardment\nbegins I will see that the palace is outside the zone of fire.\u201d\n\nAs Billy entered the room of St. Clair his eyes shone with a strange\nlight. His manner, which toward a man of his repute St. Clair\nhad considered a little too casual, was now enthusiastic, almost\naffectionate.\n\n\u201cMy dear St. Clair,\u201d cried Billy, \u201cI\u2019VE FIXED IT! But, until I was SURE,\nI didn\u2019t want to raise your hopes!\u201d\n\n\u201cHopes of what?\u201d demanded the actor.\n\n\u201cAn audience with the president!\u201d cried Billy. \u201cI\u2019ve just called him up\nand he says I\u2019m to bring you to the palace at once. He\u2019s heard of you,\nof course, and he\u2019s very pleased to meet you. I told him about \u2018The Man\nBehind the Gun,\u2019 and he says you must come in your makeup as \u2018Lieutenant\nHardy, U.S.A.,\u2019 just as he\u2019ll see you on the screen.\u201d\n\nMr. St. Clair stammered delightedly.\n\n\u201cIn uniform,\u201d he protested; \u201cwon\u2019t that be----\u201d\n\n\u201cWhite, special full dress,\u201d insisted Billy. \u201cMedals, side-arms,\nfull-dress belt, and gloves. What a press story! \u2018The King of the Movies\nMeets the President of Hayti!\u2019 Of course, he\u2019s only an ignorant negro,\nbut on Broadway they don\u2019t know that; and it will sound fine!\u201d St. Clair\ncoughed nervously.\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T forget,\u201d he stammered, \u201cI can\u2019t speak French, or understand it,\neither.\u201d\n\nThe eyes of Billy became as innocent as those of a china doll.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll interpret,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, oh, yes,\u201d he added, \u201che\u2019s sending\ntwo of the palace soldiers to act as an escort--sort of guard of honor!\u201d\n\nThe King of the Movies chuckled excitedly.\n\n\u201cFine!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou ARE a brick!\u201d\n\nWith trembling fingers he began to shed his outer garments.\n\nTo hide his own agitation Billy walked to the window and turned his\nback. Night had fallen and the electric lights, that once had been his\ncare, sprang into life. Billy looked at his watch. It was seven o\u2019clock.\nThe window gave upon the harbor, and a mile from shore he saw the cargo\nlights of the PRINZ DER NEDERLANDEN, and slowly approaching, as though\nfeeling for her berth, a great battle-ship. When Billy turned from the\nwindow his voice was apparently undisturbed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to hurry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe LOUISIANA is standing in. She\u2019ll\nsoon be sending a launch for you. We\u2019ve just time to drive to the palace\nand back before the launch gets here.\u201d\n\nFrom his mind President Ham had dismissed all thoughts of the war-ship\nthat had been sighted and that now had come to anchor. For the moment he\nwas otherwise concerned. Fate could not harm him; he was about to dine.\n\nBut, for the first time in the history of his administration, that\nsolemn ceremony was rudely halted. An excited aide, trembling at his own\ntemerity, burst upon the president\u2019s solitary state.\n\nIn the anteroom, he announced, an officer from the battle-ship LOUISIANA\ndemanded instant audience.\n\nFor a moment, transfixed in amazement, anger, and alarm President Ham\nremained seated. Such a visit, uninvited, was against all tradition; it\nwas an affront, an insult. But that it was against all precedent argued\nsome serious necessity. He decided it would be best to receive the\nofficer. Besides, to continue his dinner was now out of the question.\nBoth appetite and digestion had fled from him.\n\nIn the anteroom Billy was whispering final instructions to St. Clair.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens,\u201d he begged, \u201cdon\u2019t LAUGH! Don\u2019t even smile politely!\nHe\u2019s very ignorant, you see, and he\u2019s sensitive. When he meets\nforeigners and can\u2019t understand their language, he\u2019s always afraid if\nthey laugh that he\u2019s made a break and that they\u2019re laughing at HIM. So,\nbe solemn; look grave; look haughty!\u201d\n\n\u201cI got you!\u201d assented St. Clair. \u201cI\u2019m to \u2018register\u2019 pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d said Billy. \u201cThe more pride you register, the better for us.\u201d\n\nInwardly cold with alarm, outwardly frigidly polite, Billy presented\n\u201cLieutenant Hardy.\u201d He had come, Billy explained, in answer to the call\nfor help sent by himself to the Secretary of State, which by wireless\nhad been communicated to the LOUISIANA. Lieutenant Hardy begged him\nto say to the president that he was desolate at having to approach His\nExcellency so unceremoniously. But His Excellency, having threatened the\nlife of an American citizen, the captain, of the LOUISIANA was forced to\nact quickly.\n\n\u201cAnd this officer?\u201d demanded President Ham; \u201cwhat does he want?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says,\u201d Billy translated to St. Clair, \u201cthat he is very glad to meet\nyou, and he wants to know how much you earn a week.\u201d\n\nThe actor suppressed his surprise and with pardonable pride said that\nhis salary was six hundred dollars a week and royalties on each film.\nBilly bowed to the president.\n\n\u201cHe says,\u201d translated Billy, \u201che is here to see that I get my ten\nthousand francs, and that if I don\u2019t get them in ten minutes he will\nreturn to the ship and land marines.\u201d\n\nTo St. Clair it seemed as though the president received his statement\nas to the amount of his salary, with a disapproval that was hardly\nflattering. With the heel of his giant fist the president beat upon the\ntable, his curls shook, his gorilla-like shoulders heaved.\n\nIn an explanatory aside Billy made this clear.\n\n\u201cHe says,\u201d he interpreted, \u201cthat you get more as an actor than he gets\nas president, and it makes him mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see it does myself,\u201d whispered St. Clair. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand\nFrench, either.\u201d\n\nPresident Ham was protesting violently. It was outrageous, he exclaimed;\nit was inconceivable that a great republic should shake the Big Stick\nover the head of a small republic, and for a contemptible ten thousand\nfrancs.\n\n\u201cI will not believe,\u201d he growled, \u201cthat this officer has authority\nto threaten me. You have deceived him. If he knew the truth, he would\napologize. Tell him,\u201d he roared suddenly, \u201cthat I DEMAND that he\napologize!\u201d\n\nBilly felt like the man who, after jauntily forcing the fighting,\nunexpectedly gets a jolt on the chin that drops him to the canvas.\n\nWhile the referee might have counted three Billy remained upon the\ncanvas.\n\nThen again he forced the fighting. Eagerly he turned to St. Clair.\n\n\u201cHe says,\u201d he translated, \u201cyou must recite something.\u201d St. Clair\nexclaimed incredulously: \u201cRecite!\u201d he gasped.\n\nThan his indignant protest nothing could have been more appropriate.\n\n\u201cWants to see you act out,\u201d insisted Billy. \u201cGo on,\u201d he begged; \u201chumor\nhim. Do what he wants or he\u2019ll put us in jail!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what shall I----\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants the curse of Rome from Richelieu,\u201d explained Billy. \u201cHe knows\nit in French and he wants you to recite it in English. Do you know it?\u201d\n\nThe actor smiled haughtily.\n\n\u201cI WROTE it,\u201d he protested. \u201cRichelieu\u2019s my middle name. I\u2019ve done it in\nstock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen do it now!\u201d commanded Billy. \u201cGive it to him hot. I\u2019m Julie de\nMortemar. He\u2019s the villain Barabas. Begin where Barabas hands you the\ncue, \u2018The country is the king!\u2019\u201d\n\nIn embarrassment St. Clair coughed tentatively.\n\n\u201cWhoever heard of Cardinal Richelieu,\u201d he protested, \u201cin a navy\nuniform?\u201d\n\n\u201cBegin!\u201d begged Billy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll I do with my cap?\u201d whispered St. Clair.\n\nIn an ecstasy of alarm Billy danced from foot to foot. \u201cI\u2019ll hold your\ncap,\u201d he cried. \u201cGo on!\u201d\n\nSt. Clair gave his cap of gold braid to Billy and shifted his\n\u201cfull-dress\u201d sword-belt. Not without concern did President Ham observe\nthese preparations. For the fraction of a second, in alarm, his eyes\nglanced to the exits. He found that the officers of his staff completely\nfilled them. Their presence gave him confidence and his eyes returned to\nLieutenant Hardy.\n\nThat gentleman heaved a deep sigh. Dejectedly, his head fell forward\nuntil his chin rested upon his chest. Much to the relief of the\npresident, it appeared evident that Lieutenant Hardy was about to accede\nto his command and apologize. St. Clair groaned heavily.\n\n\u201cAy, is it so?\u201d he muttered. His voice was deep, resonant, vibrating\nlike a bell. His eyes no longer suggested apology. They were strange,\nflashing; the eyes of a religious fanatic; and balefully they were fixed\nupon President Ham.\n\n\u201cThen wakes the power,\u201d the deep voice rumbled, \u201cthat in the age of iron\nburst forth to curb the great and raise the low.\u201d He flung out his left\narm and pointed it at Billy.\n\n\u201cMark where she stands!\u201d he commanded.\n\nWith a sweeping, protecting gesture he drew around Billy an imaginary\ncircle. The pantomime was only too clear. To the aged negro, who feared\nneither God nor man, but only voodoo, there was in the voice and gesture\nthat which caused his blood to chill.\n\n\u201cAround her form,\u201d shrieked St. Clair, \u201cI draw the awful circle of\nour solemn church! Set but one foot within that holy ground and on thy\nhead----\u201d Like a semaphore the left arm dropped, and the right arm, with\nthe fore-finger pointed, shot out at President Ham. \u201cYea, though it wore\na CROWN--I launch the CURSE OF ROME!\u201d\n\nNo one moved. No one spoke. What terrible threat had hit him President\nHam could not guess. He did not ask. Stiffly, like a man in a trance, he\nturned to the rusty iron safe behind his chair and spun the handle. When\nagain he faced them he held a long envelope which he presented to Billy.\n\n\u201cThere are the ten thousand francs,\u201d he said. \u201cAsk him if he is\nsatisfied, and demand that he go at once!\u201d\n\nBilly turned to St. Clair.\n\n\u201cHe says,\u201d translated Billy, \u201che\u2019s very much obliged and hopes we will\ncome again. Now,\u201d commanded Billy, \u201cbow low and go out facing him. We\ndon\u2019t want him to shoot us in the back!\u201d\n\nBowing to the president, the actor threw at Billy a glance full of\nindignation. \u201cWas I as BAD as that?\u201d he demanded.\n\nOn schedule time Billy drove up to the Hotel Ducrot and relinquished St.\nClair to the ensign in charge of the launch from the LOUISIANA. At sight\nof St. Clair in the regalia of a superior officer, that young gentleman\nshowed his surprise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been giving a \u2018command\u2019 performance for the president,\u201d explained\nthe actor modestly. \u201cI recited for him, and, though I spoke in English,\nI think I made quite a hit.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou certainly,\u201d Billy assured him gratefully, \u201cmade a terrible hit with\nme.\u201d\n\nAs the moving-picture actors, escorted by the ensign, followed their\ntrunks to the launch, Billy looked after them with a feeling of great\nloneliness. He was aware that from the palace his carriage had been\nfollowed; that drawn in a cordon around the hotel negro policemen\ncovertly observed him. That President Ham still hoped to recover his\nlost prestige and his lost money was only too evident.\n\nIt was just five minutes to eight.\n\nBilly ran to his room, and with his suit-case in his hand slipped down\nthe back stairs and into the garden. Cautiously he made his way to the\ngate in the wall, and in the street outside found Claire awaiting him.\n\nWith a cry of relief she clasped his arm.\n\n\u201cYou are safe!\u201d she cried. \u201cI was so frightened for you. That President\nHam, he is a beast, an ogre!\u201d Her voice sank to a whisper. \u201cAnd for\nmyself also I have been frightened. The police, they are at each corner.\nThey watch the hotel. They watch ME! Why? What do they want?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want something of mine,\u201d said Billy. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you what it\nis until I\u2019m sure it is mine. Is the boat at the wharf?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll is arranged,\u201d Claire assured him. \u201cThe boatmen are our friends;\nthey will take us safely to the steamer.\u201d\n\nWith a sigh of relief Billy lifted her valise and his own, but he did\nnot move forward. Anxiously Claire pulled at his sleeve.\n\n\u201cCome!\u201d she begged. \u201cFor what it is that you wait?\u201d\n\nIt was just eight o\u2019clock.\n\nBilly was looking up at the single electric light bulb that lit the\nnarrow street, and following the direction of his eyes, Claire saw the\nlight grow dim, saw the tiny wires grow red, and disappear. From\nover all the city came shouts, and cries of consternation oaths, and\nlaughter, and then darkness.\n\n\u201cI was waiting for THIS!\u201d cried Billy.\n\nWith the delight of a mischievous child Claire laughed aloud.\n\n\u201cYou-you did it!\u201d she accused.\n\n\u201cI did!\u201d said Billy. \u201cAnd now-we must run like the devil!\u201d\n\nThe PRINZ DER NEDERLANDEN was drawing slowly out of the harbor. Shoulder\nto shoulder Claire and Billy leaned upon the rail. On the wharfs of\nPort-au-Prince they saw lanterns tossing and candles twinkling; saw the\nLOUISIANA, blazing like a Christmas-tree, steaming majestically south;\nin each other\u2019s eyes saw that all was well.\n\nFrom his pocket Billy drew a long envelope.\n\n\u201cI can now with certainty,\u201d said Billy, \u201cstate that this is mine--OURS.\u201d\n\nHe opened the envelope, and while Claire gazed upon many mille-franc\nnotes Billy told how he had retrieved them.\n\n\u201cBut what danger!\u201d cried Claire. \u201cIn time Ham would have paid. Your\npresident at Washington would have made him pay. Why take such risks?\nYou had but to wait!\u201d\n\nBilly smiled contentedly.\n\n\u201cDear one!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthe policy of watchful waiting is safer, but\nthe Big Stick acts quicker and gets results!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",
