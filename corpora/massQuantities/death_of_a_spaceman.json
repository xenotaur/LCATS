    "body": "Old Donegal was dying. They had all known it was coming, and they\nwatched it come--his haggard wife, his daughter, and now his grandson,\nhome on emergency leave from the pre-astronautics academy. Old Donegal\nknew it too, and had known it from the beginning, when he had begun to\nlose control of his legs and was forced to walk with a cane. But most of\nthe time, he pretended to let them keep the secret they shared with the\ndoctors--that the operations had all been failures, and that the cancer\nthat fed at his spine would gnaw its way brainward until the paralysis\nengulfed vital organs, and then Old Donegal would cease to be. It would\nbe cruel to let them know that he knew. Once, weeks ago, he had joked\nabout the approaching shadows.\n\n\"Buy the plot back where people won't walk over it, Martha,\" he said.\n\"Get it way back under the cedars--next to the fence. There aren't many\ngraves back there yet. I want to be alone.\"\n\n\"Don't _talk_ that way, Donny!\" his wife had choked. \"You're not dying.\"\n\nHis eyes twinkled maliciously. \"Listen, Martha, I want to be buried\nface-down. I want to be buried with my back to space, understand? Don't\nlet them lay me out like a lily.\"\n\n\"Donny, _please_!\"\n\n\"They oughta face a man the way he's headed,\" Donegal grunted. \"I been\nup--_way_ up. Now I'm going straight down.\"\n\nMartha had fled from the room in tears. He had never done it again,\nexcept to the interns and nurses, who, while they insisted that he was\ngoing to get well, didn't mind joking with him about it.\n\nMartha can bear my death, he thought, can bear pre-knowledge of it. But\nshe couldn't bear thinking that he might take it calmly. If he accepted\ndeath gracefully, it would be like deliberately leaving her, and Old\nDonegal had decided to help her believe whatever would be comforting to\nher in such a troublesome moment.\n\n\"When'll they let me out of this bed again?\" he complained.\n\n\"Be patient, Donny,\" she sighed. \"It won't be long. You'll be up and\naround before you know it.\"\n\n\"Back on the moon-run, maybe?\" he offered. \"Listen, Martha, I been\nplanet-bound too long. I'm not too old for the moon-run, am I?\nSixty-three's not so old.\"\n\nThat had been carrying things too far. She knew he was hoaxing, and\ndabbed at her eyes again. The dead must humor the mourners, he thought,\nand the sick must comfort the visitors. It was always so.\n\nBut it was harder, now that the end was near. His eyes were hazy, and\nhis thoughts unclear. He could move his arms a little, clumsily, but\nfeeling was gone from them. The rest of his body was lost to him.\nSometimes he seemed to feel his stomach and his hips, but the sensation\nwas mostly an illusion offered by higher nervous centers, like the\n\"ghost-arm\" that an amputee continues to feel. The wires were down, and\nhe was cut off from himself.\n\n\n\nHe lay wheezing on the hospital bed, in his own room, in his own rented\nflat. Gaunt and unshaven, gray as winter twilight, he lay staring at the\nwhite net curtains that billowed gently in the breeze from the open\nwindow. There was no sound in the room but the sound of breathing and\nthe loud ticking of an alarm clock. Occasionally he heard a chair\nscraping on the stone terrace next door, and the low mutter of voices,\nsometimes laughter, as the servants of the Keith mansion arranged the\nterrace for late afternoon guests.\n\nWith considerable effort, he rolled his head toward Martha who sat\nbeside the bed, pinch-faced and weary.\n\n\"You ought to get some sleep,\" he said.\n\n\"I slept yesterday. Don't talk, Donny. It tires you.\"\n\n\"You ought to get more sleep. You never sleep enough. Are you afraid\nI'll get up and run away if you go to sleep for a while?\"\n\nShe managed a brittle smile. \"There'll be plenty of time for sleep\nwhen ... when you're well again.\" The brittle smile fled and she\nswallowed hard, like swallowing a fish-bone. He glanced down, and\nnoticed that she was squeezing his hand spasmodically.\n\nThere wasn't much left of the hand, he thought. Bones and ugly\ntight-stretched hide spotted with brown. Bulging knuckles with yellow\ncigaret stains. My hand. He tried to tighten it, tried to squeeze\nMartha's thin one in return. He watched it open and contract a little,\nbut it was like operating a remote-control mechanism. Goodbye, hand,\nyou're leaving me the way my legs did, he told it. I'll see you again in\nhell. How hammy can you get, Old Donegal? You maudlin ass.\n\n\"Requiescat,\" he muttered over the hand, and let it lie in peace.\n\nPerhaps she heard him. \"Donny,\" she whispered, leaning closer, \"won't\nyou let me call the priest now? Please.\"\n\nHe rattled a sigh and rolled his head toward the window again. \"Are the\nKeiths having a party today?\" he asked. \"Sounds like they're moving\nchairs out on the terrace.\"\n\n\"Please, Donny, the priest?\"\n\nHe let his head roll aside and closed his eyes, as if asleep. The bed\nshook slightly as she quickly caught at his wrist to feel for a pulse.\n\n\"If I'm not dying, I don't need a priest,\" he said sleepily.\n\n\"That's not right,\" she scolded softly. \"You know that's not right,\nDonny. You know better.\"\n\nMaybe I'm being too rough on her? he wondered. He hadn't minded getting\nbaptized her way, and married her way, and occasionally priest-handled\nthe way she wanted him to when he was home from a space-run, but when it\ncame to dying, Old Donegal wanted to do it his own way.\n\n\n\nHe opened his eyes at the sound of a bench being dragged across the\nstone terrace. \"Martha, what kind of a party are the Keiths having\ntoday?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" she said stiffly. \"You'd think they'd have a little\nmore respect. You'd think they'd put it off a few days.\"\n\n\"Until--?\"\n\n\"Until you feel better.\"\n\n\"I feel fine, Martha. I like parties. I'm glad they're having one. Pour\nme a drink, will you? I can't reach the bottle anymore.\"\n\n\"It's empty.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't, Martha, it's still a quarter full. I know. I've been\nwatching it.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have it, Donny. Please don't.\"\n\n\"But this is a party, Martha. Besides, the doctor says I can have\nwhatever I want. Whatever I want, you hear? That means I'm getting well,\ndoesn't it?\"\n\n\"Sure, Donny, sure. Getting well.\"\n\n\"The whiskey, Martha. Just a finger in a tumbler, no more. I want to\nfeel like it's a party.\"\n\nHer throat was rigid as she poured it. She helped him get the tumbler to\nhis mouth. The liquor seared his throat, and he gagged a little as the\nfumes clogged his nose. Good whiskey, the best--but he couldn't take it\nany more. He eyed the green stamp on the neck of the bottle on the\nbed-table and grinned. He hadn't had whiskey like that since his\nspace-days. Couldn't afford it now, not on a blastman's pension.\n\n\n\nHe remembered how he and Caid used to smuggle a couple of fifths aboard\nfor the moon-run. If they caught you, it meant suspension, but there was\nno harm in it, not for the blastroom men who had nothing much to do from\nthe time the ship acquired enough velocity for the long, long coaster\nride until they started the rockets again for Lunar landing. You could\ndrink a fifth, jettison the bottle through the trash lock, and sober up\nbefore you were needed again. It was the only way to pass the time in\nthe cramped cubicle, unless you ruined your eyes trying to read by the\nglow-lamps. Old Donegal chuckled. If he and Caid had stayed on the run,\nEarth would have a ring by now, like Saturn--a ring of Old Granddad\nbottles.\n\n\"You said it, Donny-boy,\" said the misty man by the billowing curtains.\n\"Who else knows the gegenschein is broken glass?\"\n\nDonegal laughed. Then he wondered what the man was doing there. The man\nwas lounging against the window, and his unzipped space rig draped about\nhim in an old familiar way. Loose plug-in connections and hose-ends\ndangled about his lean body. He was freckled and grinning.\n\n\"Caid,\" Old Donegal breathed softly.\n\n\"What did you say, Donny?\" Martha answered.\n\nOld Donegal blinked hard and shook his head. Something let go with a\nsoggy snap, and the misty man was gone. I'd better take it easy on the\nwhiskey, he thought. You got to wait, Donegal, old lush, until Nora and\nKen get here. You can't get drunk until they're gone, or you might get\nthem mixed up with memories like Caid's.\n\nCar doors slammed in the street below. Martha glanced toward the window.\n\n\"Think it's them? I wish they'd get here. I wish they'd hurry.\"\n\nMartha arose and tiptoed to the window. She peered down toward the\nsidewalk, put on a sharp frown. He heard a distant mutter of voices and\noccasional laughter, with group-footsteps milling about on the sidewalk.\nMartha murmured her disapproval and closed the window.\n\n\"Leave it open,\" he said.\n\n\"But the Keiths' guests are starting to come. There'll be such a\nracket.\" She looked at him hopefully, the way she did when she prompted\nhis manners before company came.\n\nMaybe it wasn't decent to listen in on a party when you were dying, he\nthought. But that wasn't the reason. Donegal, your chamber-pressure's\ndropping off. Your brains are in your butt-end, where a spacer's brains\nbelong, but your butt-end died last month. She wants the window closed\nfor her own sake, not yours.\n\n\"Leave it closed,\" he grunted. \"But open it again before the moon-run\nblasts off. I want to listen.\"\n\nShe smiled and nodded, glancing at the clock. \"It'll be an hour and a\nhalf yet. I'll watch the time.\"\n\n\"I hate that clock. I wish you'd throw it out. It's loud.\"\n\n\"It's your medicine-clock, Donny.\" She came back to sit down at his\nbedside again. She sat in silence. The clock filled the room with its\nclicking pulse.\n\n\"What time are they coming?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nora and Ken? They'll be here soon. Don't fret.\"\n\n\"Why should I fret?\" He chuckled. \"That boy--he'll be a good spacer,\nwon't he, Martha?\"\n\nMartha said nothing, fanned at a fly that crawled across his pillow. The\nfly buzzed up in an angry spiral and alighted on the ceiling. Donegal\nwatched it for a time. The fly had natural-born space-legs. I know your\ntricks, he told it with a smile, and I learned to walk on the bottomside\nof things before you were a maggot. You stand there with your magnasoles\nhanging to the hull, and the rest of you's in free fall. You jerk a sole\nloose, and your knee flies up to your belly, and reaction spins you\nhalf-around and near throws your other hip out of joint if you don't jam\nthe foot down fast and jerk up the other. It's worse'n trying to run\nthrough knee-deep mud with snow-shoes, and a man'll go nuts trying to\nkeep his arms and legs from taking off in odd directions. I know your\ntricks, fly. But the fly was born with his magnasoles, and he trotted\nacross the ceiling like Donegal never could.\n\n\"That boy Ken--he ought to make a damn good space-engineer,\" wheezed the\nold man.\n\nHer silence was long, and he rolled his head toward her again. Her lips\ntight, she stared down at the palm of his hand, unfolded his bony\nfingers, felt the cracked calluses that still welted the shrunken skin,\ncalluses worn there by the linings of space gauntlets and the handles of\nfuel valves, and the rungs of get-about ladders during free fall.\n\n\"I don't know if I should tell you,\" she said.\n\n\"Tell me what, Martha?\"\n\nShe looked up slowly, scrutinizing his face. \"Ken's changed his mind,\nNora says. Ken doesn't like the academy. She says he wants to go to\nmedical school.\"\n\nOld Donegal thought it over, nodded absently. \"That's fine. Space-medics\nget good pay.\" He watched her carefully.\n\nShe lowered her eyes, rubbed at his calluses again. She shook her head\nslowly. \"He doesn't want to go to space.\"\n\nThe clock clicked loudly in the closed room.\n\n\"I thought I ought to tell you, so you won't say anything to him about\nit,\" she added.\n\nOld Donegal looked grayer than before. After a long silence, he rolled\nhis head away and looked toward the limp curtains.\n\n\"Open the window, Martha,\" he said.\n\nHer tongue clucked faintly as she started to protest, but she said\nnothing. After frozen seconds, she sighed and went to open it. The\ncurtains billowed, and a babble of conversation blew in from the terrace\nof the Keith mansion. With the sound came the occasional brassy discord\nof a musician tuning his instrument. She clutched the window-sash as if\nshe wished to slam it closed again.\n\n\"Well! Music!\" grunted Old Donegal. \"That's good. This is some shebang.\nGood whiskey and good music and you.\" He chuckled, but it choked off\ninto a fit of coughing.\n\n\"Donny, about Ken--\"\n\n\"No matter, Martha,\" he said hastily. \"Space-medic's pay is good.\"\n\n\"But, Donny--\" She turned from the window, stared at him briefly, then\nsaid, \"Sure, Donny, sure,\" and came back to sit down by his bed.\n\nHe smiled at her affectionately. She was a man's woman, was\nMartha--always had been, still was. He had married her the year he had\ngone to space--a lissome, wistful, old-fashioned lass, with big violet\neyes and gentle hands and gentle thoughts--and she had never complained\nabout the long and lonely weeks between blast-off and glide-down, when\nmost spacers' wives listened to the psychiatrists and soap-operas and\nsoon developed the symptoms that were expected of them, either because\nthe symptoms were _chic_, or because they felt they should do something\nto earn the pity that was extended to them. \"It's not so bad,\" Martha\nhad assured him. \"The house keeps me busy till Nora's home from school,\nand then there's a flock of kids around till dinner. Nights are a little\nempty, but if there's a moon, I can always go out on the porch and look\nat it and know where you are. And Nora gets out the telescope you built\nher, and we make a game of it. 'Seeing if Daddy's still at the office,'\nshe calls it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Those were the days,\" he muttered.\n\n\"What, Donny?\"\n\n\"Do you remember that Steve Farran song?\"\n\nShe paused, frowning thoughtfully. There were a lot of Steve Farran\nsongs, but after a moment she picked the right one, and sang it\nsoftly ...\n\n    \"O moon whereo'er the clouds fly,\n    Beyond the willow tree,\n    There is a ramblin' space guy\n    I wish you'd save for me.\n\n    \"_Mare Tranquillitatis_,\n    O dark and tranquil sea,\n    Until he drops from heaven,\n    Rest him there with thee ...\"\n\nHer voice cracked, and she laughed. Old Donegal chuckled weakly.\n\n\"Fried mush,\" he said. \"That one made the cats wilt their ears and wail\nat the moon.\n\n\"I feel real crazy,\" he added. \"Hand me the king kong, fluff-muff.\"\n\n\"Keep cool, Daddy-O, you've had enough.\" Martha reddened and patted his\narm, looking pleased. Neither of them had talked that way, even in the\nold days, but the out-dated slang brought back memories--school parties,\ndances at the Rocketport Club, the early years of the war when Donegal\nhad jockeyed an R-43 fighter in the close-space assaults against the\nSoviet satellite project. The memories were good.\n\nA brassy blare of modern \"slide\" arose suddenly from the Keith terrace\nas the small orchestra launched into its first number. Martha caught an\nangry breath and started toward the window.\n\n\"Leave it,\" he said. \"It's a party. Whiskey, Martha. Please--just a\nsmall one.\"\n\nShe gave him a hurtful glance.\n\n\"Whiskey. Then you can call the priest.\"\n\n\"Donny, it's not right. You know it's not right--to bargain for such as\nthat.\"\n\n\"All right. Whiskey. Forget the priest.\"\n\nShe poured it for him, and helped him get it down, and then went out to\nmake the phone-call. Old Donegal lay shuddering over the whiskey taste\nand savoring the burn in his throat. Jesus, but it was good.\n\nYou old bastard, he thought, you got no right to enjoy life when\nnine-tenths of you is dead already, and the rest is foggy as a thermal\ndust-rise on the lunar maria at hell-dawn. But it wasn't a bad way to\ndie. It ate your consciousness away from the feet up; it gnawed away the\nPresent, but it let you keep the Past, until everything faded and\nblended. Maybe that's what Eternity was, he thought--one man's\nsubjective Past, all wrapped up and packaged for shipment, a single\nspace-time entity, a one-man microcosm of memories, when nothing else\nremains.\n\n\"If I've got a soul, I made it myself,\" he told the gray nun at the foot\nof his bed.\n\nThe nun held out a pie pan, rattled a few coins in it. \"Contribute to\nthe Radiation Victims' Relief?\" the nun purred softly.\n\n\"I know you,\" he said. \"You're my conscience. You hang around the\nofficers' mess, and when we get back from a sortie, you make us pay for\nthe damage we did. But that was forty years ago.\"\n\nThe nun smiled, and her luminous eyes were on him softly. \"Mother of\nGod!\" he breathed, and reached for the whiskey. His arm obeyed. The last\ndrink had done him good. He had to watch his hand to see where it was\ngoing, and squeezed the neck until his fingers whitened so that he knew\nthat he had it, but he got it off the table and onto his chest, and he\ngot the cork out with his teeth. He had a long pull at the bottle, and\nit made his eyes water and his hands grow weak. But he got it back to\nthe table without spilling a bit, and he was proud of himself.\n\nThe room was spinning like the cabin of a gyro-gravved ship. By the time\nhe wrestled it to a standstill, the nun was gone. The blare of music\nfrom the Keith terrace was louder, and laughing voices blended with it.\nChairs scraping and glasses rattling. A fine party, Keith, I'm glad you\npicked today. This shebang would be the younger Keith's affair. Ronald\nTonwyler Keith, III, scion of Orbital Engineering and Construction\nCompany--builders of the moon-shuttle ships that made the run from the\nsatellite station to Luna and back.\n\nIt's good to have such important neighbors, he thought. He wished he had\nbeen able to meet them while he was still up and about. But the Keiths'\nplace was walled-in, and when a Keith came out, he charged out in a\nlimousine with a chauffeur at the wheel, and the iron gate closed again.\nThe Keiths built the wall when the surrounding neighborhood began to\ngrow shabby with age. It had once been the best of neighborhoods, but\nthat was before Old Donegal lived in it. Now it consisted of sooty old\nhouses and rented flats, and the Keith place was really not a part of it\nanymore. Nevertheless, it was really something when a pensioned blastman\ncould say, \"I live out close to the Keiths--you know, the _Ronald_\nKeiths.\" At least, that's what Martha always told him.\n\nThe music was so loud that he never heard the doorbell ring, but when a\nlull came, he heard Nora's voice downstairs, and listened hopefully for\nKen's. But when they came up, the boy was not with them.\n\n\"Hello, skinny-britches,\" he greeted his daughter.\n\nNora grinned and came over to kiss him. Her hair dangled about his face,\nand he noticed that it was blacker than usual, with the gray streaks\ngone from it again.\n\n\"You smell good,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't, Pops. You smell like a sot. Naughty!\"\n\n\"Where's Ken?\"\n\nShe moistened her lips nervously and looked away. \"He couldn't come. He\nhad to take a driver's lesson. He really couldn't help it. If he didn't\ngo, he'd lose his turn, and then he wouldn't finish before he goes back\nto the academy.\" She looked at him apologetically.\n\n\"It's all right, Nora.\"\n\n\"If he missed it, he wouldn't get his copter license until summer.\"\n\n\"It's okay. Copters! Hell, the boy should be in jets by now!\"\n\nSeveral breaths passed in silence. She gazed absently toward the window\nand shook her head. \"No jets, Pop. Not for Ken.\"\n\nHe glowered at her. \"Listen! How'll he get into space? He's got to get\nhis jet licenses first. Can't get in rockets without 'em.\"\n\nNora shot a quick glance at her mother. Martha rolled her eyes as if\nsighing patiently. Nora went to the window to stare down toward the\nKeith terrace. She tucked a cigaret between scarlet lips, lit it, blew\nnervous smoke against the pane.\n\n\"Mom, can't you call them and have that racket stopped?\"\n\n\"Donny says he likes it.\"\n\nNora's eyes flitted over the scene below. \"Female butterflies and\npuppy-dogs in sport jackets. And the cadets.\" She snorted. \"Cadets!\nImagine Ron Keith the Third ever going to space. The old man buys his\nway into the academy, and they throw a brawl as if Ronny passed the\nCompets.\"\n\n\"Maybe he did,\" growled Old Donegal.\n\n\"Hah!\"\n\n\"They live in a different world, I guess,\" Martha sighed.\n\n\"If it weren't for men like Pops, they'd never've made their fortune.\"\n\n\"I like the music, I tell you,\" grumbled the old man.\n\n\"I'm half-a-mind to go over there and tell them off,\" Nora murmured.\n\n\"Let them alone. Just so they'll stop the racket for blast-away.\"\n\n\"Look at them!--polite little pattern-cuts, all alike. They take\npre-space, because it's the thing to do. Then they quit before the\npay-off comes.\"\n\n\"How do you know they'll quit?\"\n\n\"That party--I bet it cost six months' pay, spacer's pay,\" she went on,\nignoring him. \"And what do real spacers get? Oley gets killed, and Pop's\npension wouldn't feed the Keiths' cat.\"\n\n\"You don't understand, girl.\"\n\n\"I lost Oley. I understand enough.\"\n\n\n\nHe watched her silently for a moment, then closed his eyes. It was no\ngood trying to explain, no good trying to tell her the dough didn't mean\na damn thing. She'd been a spacer's wife, and that was bad enough, but\nnow she was a spacer's widow. And Oley? Oley's tomb revolved around the\nsun in an eccentric orbit that spun-in close to Mercury, then reached\nout into the asteroid belt, once every 725 days. When it came within\nrocket radius of Earth, it whizzed past at close to fifteen miles a\nsecond.\n\nYou don't rescue a ship like that, skinny-britches, my darling daughter.\nNor do you salvage it after the crew stops screaming for help. If you\nuse enough fuel to catch it, you won't get back. You just leave such a\nship there forever, like an asteroid, and it's a damn shame about the\nmen trapped aboard. Heroes all, no doubt--but the smallness of the\nwidow's monthly check failed to confirm the heroism, and Nora was bitter\nabout the price of Oley's memory, perhaps.\n\nOuch! Old Donegal, you know she's not like that. It's just that she\ncan't understand about space. You ought to make her understand.\n\nBut did he really understand himself? You ride hot in a roaring\nblastroom, hands tense on the mixer controls and the pumps, eyes glued\nto instruments, body sucked down in a four-gravity thrust, and wait for\nthe command to choke it off. Then you float free and weightless in a\nlong nightmare as the beast coasts moonward, a flung javelin.\n\nThe \"romance\" of space--drivel written in the old days. When you're not\nblasting, you float in a cramped hotbox, crawl through dirty mazes of\ngreasy pipe and cable to tighten a lug, scratch your arms and bark your\nshins, get sick and choked up because no gravity helps your gullet get\nthe food down. Liquid is worse, but you gag your whiskey down because\nyou have to.\n\nStars?--you see stars by squinting through a viewing lens, and it's like\na photo-transparency, and if you aren't careful, you'll get an eyeful of\nOld Blinder and back off with a punch-drunk retina.\n\nAdventure?--unless the skipper calls for course-correction, you float\naround in the blast-cubicle with damn little to do between blast-away\nand moon-down, except sweat out the omniscient accident statistics. If\nthe beast blows up or gets gutted in space, a statistic had your name\non it, that's all, and there's no fighting back. You stay outwardly sane\nbecause you're a hog for punishment; if you weren't, you'd never get\npast the psychologists.\n\n\"Did you like horror movies when you were a kid?\" asked the psych. And\nyou'd damn well better answer \"yes,\" if you want to go to space.\n\n\n\nTell her, old man, you're her pop. Tell her why it's worth it, if you\nknow. You jail yourself in a coffin-size cubicle, and a crazy beast\nthunders berserk for uncontrollable seconds, and then you soar in\nominous silence for the long, long hours. Grow sweaty, filthy, sick,\nmiserable, idle--somewhere out in Big Empty, where Man's got no business\nexcept the trouble he always makes for himself wherever he goes. Tell\nher why it's worth it, for pay less than a good bricklayer's. Tell her\nwhy Oley would do it again.\n\n\"It's a sucker's run, Nora,\" he said. \"You go looking for kicks, but the\nonly kicks you get to keep is what Oley got. God knows why--but it's\nworth it.\"\n\nNora said nothing. He opened his eyes slowly. Nora was gone. Had she\nbeen there at all?\n\nHe blinked around at the fuzzy room, and dissolved the shifting shadows\nthat sometimes emerged as old friendly faces, grinning at him. He found\nMartha.\n\n\"You went to sleep,\" said Martha. \"She had to go. Kennie called. He'll\nbe over later, if you're not too tired.\"\n\n\"I'm not tired. I'm all head. There's nothing much to get tired.\"\n\n\"I love you, Old Donegal.\"\n\n\"Hold my hand again.\"\n\n\"I'm holding it, old man.\"\n\n\"Then hold me where I can feel it.\"\n\nShe slid a thin arm under his neck, and bent over his face to kiss him.\nShe was crying a little, and he was glad she could do it now without\nfleeing the room.\n\n\"Can I talk about dying now?\" he wondered aloud.\n\nShe pinched her lips together and shook her head.\n\n\"I lie to myself, Martha. You know how much I lie to myself?\"\n\nShe nodded slowly and stroked his gray temples.\n\n\"I lie to myself about Ken, and about dying. If Ken turned spacer, I\nwouldn't die--that's what I told myself. You know?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Don't talk, Donny, please.\"\n\n\"A man makes his own soul, Martha.\"\n\n\"That's not true. You shouldn't say things like that.\"\n\n\"A man makes his own soul, but it dies with him, unless he can pour it\ninto his kids and his grandchildren before he goes. I lied to myself.\nKen's a yellow-belly. Nora made him one, and the boots won't fit.\"\n\n\"Don't, Donny. You'll excite yourself again.\"\n\n\"I was going to give him the boots--the over-boots with magnasoles. But\nthey won't fit him. They won't ever fit him. He's a lily-livered\nlap-dog, and he whines. Bring me my boots, woman.\"\n\n\"Donny!\"\n\n\"The boots, they're in my locker in the attic. I want them.\"\n\n\"What on earth!\"\n\n\"Bring me my goddam space boots and put them on my feet. I'm going to\nwear them.\"\n\n\"You can't; the priest's coming.\"\n\n\"Well, get them anyway. What time is it? You didn't let me sleep through\nthe moon-run blast, did you?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"It's half an hour yet ... I'll get the boots if you\npromise not to make me put them on you.\"\n\n\"I want them on.\"\n\n\"You can't, until Father Paul's finished.\"\n\n\"Do I have to get my feet buttered?\"\n\nShe sighed. \"I wish you wouldn't say things like that. I wish you\nwouldn't, Donny. It's sacrilege, you know it is.\"\n\n\"All right--'anointed',\" he corrected wearily.\n\n\"Yes, you do.\"\n\n\"The boots, woman, the boots.\"\n\nShe went to get them. While she was gone, the doorbell rang, and he\nheard her quick footsteps on the stairs, and then Father Paul's voice\nasking about the patient. Old Donegal groaned inwardly. After the\npriest, the doctor would come, at the usual time, to see if he were dead\nyet. The doctor had let him come home from the hospital to die, and the\ndoctor was getting impatient. Why don't they let me alone? he growled.\nWhy don't they let me handle it in my own way, and stop making a fuss\nover it? I can die and do a good job of it without a lot of outside\ninterference, and I wish they'd quit picking at me with syringes and\nsacraments and enemas. All he wanted was a chance to listen to the\norchestra on the Keith terrace, to drink the rest of his whiskey, and to\nhear the beast blast-away for the satellite on the first lap of the run\nto Luna.\n\n\n\nIt's going to be my last day, he thought. My eyes are going fuzzy, and I\ncan't breathe right, and the throbbing's hurting my head. Whether he\nlived through the night wouldn't matter, because delirium was coming\nover him, and then there would be the coma, and the symbolic fight to\nkeep him pumping and panting. I'd rather die tonight and get it over\nwith, he thought, but they probably won't let me go.\n\nHe heard their voices coming up the stairs ...\n\n\"Nora tried to get them to stop it, Father, but she couldn't get in to\nsee anybody but the butler. He told her he'd tell Mrs. Keith, but\nnothing happened. It's just as loud as before.\"\n\n\"Well, as long as Donny doesn't mind--\"\n\n\"He just says that. You know how he is.\"\n\n\"What're they celebrating, Martha?\"\n\n\"Young Ronald's leaving--for pre-space training. It's a going-away\naffair.\" They paused in the doorway. The small priest smiled in at\nDonegal and nodded. He set his black bag on the floor inside, winked\nsolemnly at the patient.\n\n\"I'll leave you two alone,\" said Martha. She closed the door and her\nfootsteps wandered off down the hall.\n\nDonegal and the young priest eyed each other warily.\n\n\"You look like hell, Donegal,\" the padre offered jovially. \"Feeling\nnasty?\"\n\n\"Skip the small talk. Let's get this routine over with.\"\n\nThe priest humphed thoughtfully, sauntered across to the bed, gazed down\nat the old man disinterestedly. \"What's the matter? Don't want the\n'routine'? Rather play it tough?\"\n\n\"What's the difference?\" he growled. \"Hurry up and get out. I want to\nhear the beast blast off.\"\n\n\"You won't be able to,\" said the priest, glancing at the window, now\nclosed again. \"That's quite a racket next door.\"\n\n\"They'd better stop for it. They'd better quiet down for it. They'll\nhave to turn it off for five minutes or so.\"\n\n\"Maybe they won't.\"\n\nIt was a new idea, and it frightened him. He liked the music, and the\nparty's gaiety, the nearness of youth and good times--but it hadn't\noccurred to him that it wouldn't stop so he could hear the beast.\n\n\"Don't get upset, Donegal. You know what a blast-off sounds like.\"\n\n\"But it's the last one. The last time. I want to hear.\"\n\n\"How do you know it's the last time?\"\n\n\"Hell, don't I know when I'm kicking off?\"\n\n\"Maybe, maybe not. It's hardly your decision.\"\n\n\"It's not, eh?\" Old Donegal fumed. \"Well, bigawd you'd think it wasn't.\nYou'd think it was Martha's and yours and that damfool medic's. You'd\nthink I got no say-so. Who's doing it anyway?\"\n\n\"I would guess,\" Father Paul grunted sourly, \"that Providence might\nappreciate His fair share of the credit.\"\n\nOld Donegal made a surly noise and hunched his head back into the pillow\nto glower.\n\n\"You want me?\" the priest asked. \"Or is this just a case of wifely\nconscience?\"\n\n\"What's the difference? Give me the business and scram.\"\n\n\"No soap. Do you want the sacrament, or are you just being kind to your\nwife? If it's for Martha, I'll go _now_.\"\n\nOld Donegal glared at him for a time, then wilted. The priest brought\nhis bag to the bedside.\n\n\"Bless me, father, for I have sinned.\"\n\n\"Bless you, son.\"\n\n\"I accuse myself ...\"\n\n\n\nTension, anger, helplessness--they had piled up on him, and now he was\nfeeling the after-effects. Vertigo, nausea, and the black confetti--a\nbad spell. The whiskey--if he could only reach the whiskey. Then he\nremembered he was receiving a Sacrament, and struggled to get on with\nit. Tell him, old man, tell him of your various rottennesses and vile\ntransgressions, if you can remember some. A sin is whatever you're sorry\nfor, maybe. But Old Donegal, you're sorry for the wrong things, and this\nyoung jesuitical gadget wouldn't like listening to it. I'm sorry I\ndidn't get it instead of Oley, and I'm sorry I fought in the war, and\nI'm sorry I can't get out of this bed and take a belt to my daughter's\nbackside for making a puny whelp out of Ken, and I'm sorry I gave Martha\nsuch a rough time all these years--and wound up dying in a cheap flat,\ninstead of giving her things like the Keiths had. I wish I had been a\nsharpster, contractor, or thief ... instead of a common laboring spacer,\nwhose species lost its glamor after the war.\n\nListen, old man, you made your soul yourself, and it's yours. This young\ndispenser of oils, substances, and mysteries wishes only to help you\nscrape off the rough edges and gouge out the bad spots. He will not\nsteal it, nor distort it with his supernatural chisels, nor make fun of\nit. He can take nothing away, but only cauterize and neutralize, he\nsays, so why not let him try? Tell him the rotten messes.\n\n\"Are you finished, my son?\"\n\nOld Donegal nodded wearily, and said what he was asked to say, and heard\nthe soft mutter of Latin that washed him inside and behind his ghostly\nears ... _ego te absolvo in Nomine Patris_ ... and he accepted the rest\nof it lying quietly in the candlelight and the red glow of the sunset\nthrough the window, while the priest anointed him and gave him bread,\nand read the words of the soul in greeting its spouse: \"I was asleep,\nbut my heart waked; it is the voice of my beloved calling: come to me my\nlove, my dove, my undefiled ...\" and from beyond the closed window came\nthe sarcastic wail of a clarinet painting hot slides against a rhythmic\nbackground.\n\nIt wasn't so bad, Old Donegal thought when the priest was done. He felt\nlike a schoolboy in a starched shirt on Sunday morning, and it wasn't a\nbad feeling, though it left him weak.\n\nThe priest opened the window for him again, and repacked his bag. \"Ten\nminutes till blast-off,\" he said. \"I'll see what I can do about the\nracket next door.\"\n\nWhen he was gone, Martha came back in, and he looked at her face and was\nglad. She was smiling when she kissed him, and she looked less tired.\n\n\"Is it all right for me to die now?\" he grunted.\n\n\"Donny, don't start that again.\"\n\n\"Where's the boots? You promised to bring them?\"\n\n\"They're in the hall. Donny, you don't want them.\"\n\n\"I want them, and I want a drink of whiskey, and I want to hear them\nfire the beast.\" He said it slow and hard, and he left no room for\nargument.\n\nWhen she had got the huge boots over his shrunken feet, the magnasoles\nclanged against the iron bedframe and clung there, and she rolled him up\nso that he could look at them, and Old Donegal chuckled inside. He felt\nwarm and clean and pleasantly dizzy.\n\n\"The whiskey, Martha, and for God's sake, make them stop the noise till\nafter the firing. Please!\"\n\nShe went to the window and looked out for a long time. Then she came\nback and poured him an insignificant drink.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said. \"I saw Father Paul on the terrace, talking to\nsomebody.\"\n\n\"Is it time?\"\n\nShe glanced at the clock, looked at him doubtfully, and nodded. \"Nearly\ntime.\"\n\nThe orchestra finished a number, but the babble of laughing voices\ncontinued. Old Donegal sagged. \"They won't do it. They're the Keiths,\nMartha. Why should I ruin their party?\"\n\nShe turned to stare at him, slowly shook her head. He heard someone\nshouting, but then a trumpet started softly, introducing a new number.\nMartha sucked in a hurt breath, pressed her hands together, and hurried\nfrom the room.\n\n\"It's too late,\" he said after her.\n\nHer footsteps stopped on the stairs. The trumpet was alone. Donegal\nlistened; and there was no babble of voices, and the rest of the\norchestra was silent. Only the trumpet sang--and it puzzled him, hearing\nthe same slow bugle-notes of the call played at the lowering of the\ncolors.\n\nThe trumpet stopped suddenly. Then he knew it had been for him.\n\nA brief hush--then thunder came from the blast-station two miles to the\nwest. First the low reverberation, rattling the windows, then the rising\ngrowl as the sleek beast knifed skyward on a column of blue-white hell.\nIt grew and grew until it drowned the distant traffic sounds and\ndominated the silence outside.\n\n_Quit crying, you old fool, you maudlin ass ..._\n\n\"My boots,\" he whispered, \"my boots ... please ...\"\n\n\"You've got them on, Donny.\"\n\nHe sank quietly then. He closed his eyes and let his heart go up with\nthe beast, and he sank into the gravity padding of the blastroom, and\nCaid was with him, and Oley. And when Ronald Keith, III, instructed the\norchestra to play Blastroom Man, after the beast's rumble had waned, Old\nDonegal was on his last moon-run, and he was grinning. He'd had a good\nday.\n\nMartha went to the window to stare out at the thin black trail that\ncurled starward above the blast-station through the twilight sky. Guests\non the terrace were watching it too.\n\nThe doorbell rang. That would be Ken, too late. She closed the window\nagainst the chill breeze, and went back to the bed. The boots, the\nheavy, clumsy boots--they clung to the bedframe, with his feet half out\nof them. She took them off gently and set them out of company's sight.\nThen she went to answer the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
