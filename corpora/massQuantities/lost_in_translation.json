But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the\nTr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed\non that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made\nKorvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and\nwere on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd be\nsettling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.\nFaster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently\nefficient physical scientists of the Tr'en--and that would mean, in\nthe ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of\nPlanets.\n\nAn invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.\n\nKorvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which\nwas hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of\nisolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own\nmind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was\nno good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't\nunlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the\nprobability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat\nsmelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by\nmagic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,\nto the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.\n\nHe could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly\nthat the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or\neven a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according to\nall the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd\nhave been better than nothing.\n\nIn any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there\nwould at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'en\nKorvin was all alone.\n\nTrue, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated\nlesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure\nout of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to\ndiscuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was\nnobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared\nat the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even any\nimperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.\n\nHe wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a\nfull stock of food concentrates.\n\nBut he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to\nanyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.\n\nAs he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got\nup off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.\n\nThe Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.\n\nHe looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid--that is, if you\ndon't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to\nbe rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't\nknow why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,\nbut none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin\nreally didn't care about it; it was none of his business.\n\nThe Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. \"You are\nKorvin,\" he said.\n\nIt was a ritual, Korvin had learned. \"You are of the Tr'en,\" he\nreplied. The green being nodded.\n\n\"I am Didyak of the Tr'en,\" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed\nslightly--but no more than slightly--and came into the cell, closing\nthe door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided\nquickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that\nhis captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small\ntranslucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a\nsmall knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but\nthere might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.\n\n\"What do you want with me?\" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech--apparently\nthere was only one language on the planet--was stiff and slightly\nawkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the\nmost rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come\nacross. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd\ndealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and\ncarefully constructed than even those marvels.\n\n\"I want nothing with you,\" Didyak said, leaning against the\ndoor-frame. \"You have other questions?\"\n\nKorvin sighed. \"What are you doing here, then?\" he asked. As\nconversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better\nthan solitude.\n\n\"I am leaning against the door,\" Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist\napproach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard\nto get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a\nsecond.\n\n\"Why did you come to me?\" he said at last.\n\nDidyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving\nas it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly\npointed. Korvin stared back impassively. \"I have been ordered to come\nto you,\" Didyak said, \"by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with\nyou.\"\n\nIt wasn't quite \"talk\"; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,\nand Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: \"gain information\nfrom, by peaceful and vocal means.\" Korvin filed it away for future\nreference. \"Why did the Ruler not come to me?\" Korvin asked.\n\n\"The Ruler is the Ruler,\" Didyak said, slightly discomfited. \"You are\nto go to him. Such is his command.\"\n\nKorvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. \"I obey the\ncommand of the Ruler,\" he said--another ritual. Everybody obeyed the\ncommand of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to\ntry.\n\nBut Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the\ncommands of the Ruler of the Tr'en--and remove the Tr'en threat from\nthe rest of the galaxy forever.\n\nThat, after all, was his job.\n\n\n\nThe Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The\nwalls were dark-brown, the furnishings--a single great chair, several\nkneeling-benches and a small table near the chair--were light-brown,\nof some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,\nKorvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color\ncontrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in.\n\nThe Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly\nbroad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the\ntable near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on\neither side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,\nsix and a half feet high.\n\nKorvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler.\nHe wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.\n\nThe Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.\nThe Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex--if\nany--and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.\n\nKorvin was answering the last question. \"Some men are larger than I\nam,\" he said, \"and some are smaller.\"\n\n\"Within what limits?\"\n\nKorvin shrugged. \"Some are over eight feet tall,\" he said, \"and others\nunder four feet.\" He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it\ndidn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height\nwere at the circus-freak level. \"Then there is a group of humans,\" he\nwent on, \"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and\nusually less than that--approximately nine or ten inches. We call\nthese _children_,\" he volunteered helpfully.\n\n\"Approximately?\" the Ruler growled. \"We ask for precision here,\" he\nsaid. \"We are scientific men. We are exact.\"\n\nKorvin nodded hurriedly. \"Our race is more ... more approximate,\" he\nsaid apologetically.\n\n\"Slipshod,\" the Ruler muttered.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" Korvin agreed politely. \"I'll try to do the best I can\nfor you.\"\n\n\"You will answer my questions,\" the Ruler said, \"with exactitude.\" He\npaused, frowning slightly. \"You landed your ship on this planet,\" he\nwent on. \"Why?\"\n\n\"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"A clumsy lie,\" the Ruler said. \"The ship crashed; our examinations\nprove that beyond any doubt.\"\n\n\"True,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"And it is your job to crash your ship?\" the Ruler said. \"Wasteful.\"\n\nKorvin shrugged again. \"What I say is true,\" he announced. \"Do you\nhave tests for such matters?\"\n\n\"We do,\" the Ruler told him. \"We are an exact and a scientific race. A\nmachine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.\nIt will be attached to you.\"\n\nKorvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two\ntechnicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,\ndials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and\nstraps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector--and Korvin felt\nhimself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to\nmatch their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a\nhypnop\u221a\u00b6dic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been\nwonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that\nnecessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.\nThe Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable\naddition to the Comity of Nations.\n\nBeing what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And\nKorvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.\n\nHe hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed\nhim telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his\njob--not to mention the strongest personal inclinations--demanded most\nstrongly that he stay alive.\n\nHe swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the\nseat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and\nelastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final\nscrews, he made no resistance.\n\n\"We shall test the machine,\" the Ruler said. \"In what room are you?\"\n\n\"In the Room of the Ruler,\" Korvin said equably.\n\n\"Are you standing or sitting?\"\n\n\"I am sitting,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"Are you a _chulad_?\" the Ruler asked. A _chulad_ was a small native\npet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch\nbeetle.\n\n\"I am not,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on\nreceiving it. \"You will tell an untruth now,\" he said. \"Are you\nstanding or sitting?\"\n\n\"I am standing,\" Korvin said.\n\nThe technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning\nmanner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been\nadjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\ncontinue.\"\n\nKorvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough\nto him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than\nanyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and\nthe training.\n\nHe hoped they were right.\n\nThe Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\n\"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n\nThe Ruler nodded. \"Your job is to crash your ship,\" he said. \"It is\nwasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we\nshall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\"\n\nKorvin looked sober. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\nThe Ruler blinked. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Was your job ended when the\nship crashed?\" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't _ended_, nor did it\nmean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\n\"disposed of for all time.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said.\n\nKorvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying\nalive.\"\n\nThe Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted.\n\"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer\ncorrectly.\"\n\n\"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"But it is not--not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said.\n\nKorvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not\nknow that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\nthe truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\"\n\n\"I--\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the\nRuler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But\nthe Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of\nlogic\"--the Tr'en word seemed to mean _right-saying_--\"who will advise\nthe Ruler. They will be called.\"\n\nKorvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now\nthat their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler\ngestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\n\nThe Ruler looked down at Korvin. \"You will find that you cannot trick\nus,\" he said. \"You will find that such fiddling\"--_chulad-like_ Korvin\ntranslated--\"attempts will get you nowhere.\"\n\nKorvin devoutly hoped so.\n\n\n\nThe experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin\nwas given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse\nanybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself,\nthe secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and\nthe tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around\nwere so much primer material for the Tr'en. \"They can be treated\nmathematically,\" one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told\nKorvin thinly. \"Of course, you would not understand the mathematics.\nBut that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be\nconfused by such means.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Korvin said.\n\nThe experts blinked. \"Good?\" he said.\n\n\"Naturally,\" Korvin said in a friendly tone.\n\nThe expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his\nbest not to react. \"Your plan is a failure,\" the expert said, \"and you\ncall this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different\nfrom the one we are occupied with.\"\n\n\"True,\" Korvin said.\n\nThere was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the\nindicators of the lie-detector with great care. \"What is your plan?\"\nhe said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.\n\n\"To answer your questions, truthfully and logically,\" Korvin said.\n\nThe silence this time was even longer.\n\n\"The machine says that you tell the truth,\" the experts said at last,\nin a awed tone. \"Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet.\nYou must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly\nto aid us.\"\n\nKorvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the\nonly logical deduction.\n\nBut it happened to be wrong.\n\n\n\n\"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\npassed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n\n\"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n\n\"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n\n\"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n\nThere was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\"I can,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n\n\"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n\n\"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\n\nKorvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n\nA short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\n\nVery sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n\n\"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n\n\"It is,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n\nThe key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n\n\"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n\n\"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n\n\"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n\n\"True,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\"True,\" Korvin said again.\n\nThe ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n\nKorvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n\nThe Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n\n\"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n\n\"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n\nIt was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n\nThe plan was taking hold.\n\nThe Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n\nKorvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n\n\"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n\n\"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n\nThe Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n\nKorvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n\nThe Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n\n\"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n\nKorvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n\nThe Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n\n\"None,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"But you are governed?\"\n\nKorvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n\n\"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n\n\"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n\n\"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n\n\"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n\n\"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n\n\"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n\nKorvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n\n\"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n\nThe Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples--\"\n\n\"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n\n\"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions--\"\n\n\"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n\n\"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n\n\"We call our form of government _democracy_,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n\nOne of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n\n\"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n\n\"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n\nOne of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us--\"\n\n\"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n\nKorvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n\nIt took three days--but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n\nSome of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n\nOn the third day Korvin escaped.\n\nIt wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n\nBecause that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem _was_ insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n\nKorvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n\nBut, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n\nThe same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby--all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n\nHe set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n\n     _Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\n     marauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\n     for thought--nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\n     their craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\n     can't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\n     democratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\n     keeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\n     obeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\n     self-interest, of course--but try to make a Tr'en see it!_\n\n     _With one government and one language, they just weren't\n     equipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\n     to try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\n     no insight into my mind or their own--and that means no\n     translation._\n\n     _But--damn it--I wish I were home already._\n\n     _I'm bored absolutely stiff!_\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
