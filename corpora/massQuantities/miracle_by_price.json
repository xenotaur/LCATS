As you requested, I personally examined the\nlaboratory. Candidly, Bill, you needed a psychiatrist for the job, not\na graduate physicist. Dr. Price was undoubtedly an inventive genius a\ndecade ago when he was still active in General Electronics, but his lab\nwas an embarrassing example of senile clutter.\n\nYou had an idea, Bill, that before he died Price might have been\nplaying around with a new invention which the estate could develop and\npatent. I found a score of gadgets in the lab, none of them finished\nand none of them built for any functional purpose that I could discover.\n\nOnly two seemed to be completed. One resembled a small, portable radio.\nIt was a plastic case with two knobs and a two-inch speaker grid. There\nwas no cord outlet. The machine may have been powered by batteries, for\nI heard a faint humming when I turned the knobs. Nothing else. Dr.\nPrice had left a handwritten card on the box. He intended to call it\na Semantic-Translator, but he had noted that the word combination was\nawkward for commercial exploitation, and I suppose he held up a patent\napplication until he could think of a catchier name. One sentence on\nthat card would have amused you, Bill. Price wrote, \"Should wholesale\nfor about three-fifty per unit.\" Even in his dotage, he had an eye for\nprofit.\n\nThe Semantic-Translator--whatever that may mean--might have had\npossibilities. I fully intended to take it back with me to General\nElectronics and examine it thoroughly.\n\nThe second device, which Price had labeled a Transpositor, was large\nand rather fragile. It was a hollow cylinder of very small wires,\nperhaps a foot in diameter, fastened to an open-faced console crowded\nwith a weird conglomeration of vacuum tubes, telescopic lenses and\nmirrors. The cylinder of wires was so delicate that the motion of my\nbody in the laboratory caused it to quiver. Standing in front of the\nwire coil were two brass rods. A kind of shovel-like chute was fixed to\none rod (Price called it the shipping board). Attached to the second\nrod was a long-handled pair of tongs which he called the grapple.\n\nThe Transpositor was, I think, an outgrowth of Price's investigation\nof the relationship between light and matter. You may recall, Bill,\nthe brilliant technical papers he wrote on that subject when he was\nstill working in the laboratories of General Electronics. At the time\nPrice was considered something of a pioneer. He believed that light and\nmatter were different forms of the same basic element; he said that\neventually science would learn how to change one into the other.\n\nI seriously believe that the Transpositor was meant to do precisely\nthat. In other words, Price had expected to transpose the atomic\nstructure of solid matter into light, and later to reconstruct the\noriginal matter again. Now don't assume, Bill, that Price was wandering\naround in a senile delusion of fourth dimensional nonsense. The theory\nmay be sound. Our present knowledge of the physical world makes the\nbasic structure of matter more of a mystery than it has ever been.\n\nNot that I think Price achieved the miracle. Even in his most\nbrilliant and productive period he could not have done it. As yet\nour accumulation of data is too incomplete for such an experiment. I\nbelieve that Price created no more than a very realistic illusion with\nhis arrangement of lenses and mirrors.\n\nI saw the illusion, too; I used the machine.\n\nThere were two dials on the front of the console. One was lettered\n\"time\", and the other \"distance\". The \"time\" dial could be set for\neons, centuries or hours, depending upon the position of a three-way\nswitch beneath it; the \"distance\" dial could be adjusted to light\nyears, thousand-mile units, or kilometers by a similar device. Since\nthere was no indication which position would produce what results,\nI left the dials untouched. I plugged the machine into an electric\noutlet and pushed the starter button. The coil of wire blazed with\nlight and the chute slid rapidly in and out of the cylinder.\n\nThat was all, at first. The starter button was labeled \"the shipper\",\nand I gathered that Price had visualized the practical application of\nthe Transpositor as a device for transporting goods from one point to\nanother.\n\nI looked around the lab for something I could put into the chute.\nThere was a card, written in red, warning me not to load beyond\nthe dimensional limits of the chute. The only thing I saw that was\nsmall enough was the little radio-like gadget Price had called a\nSemantic-Translator. Loaded horizontally, it just barely fit the chute.\n\nI pushed the shipper button a second time. Again there was a blaze\nof light, brighter than before, which temporarily blinded me. For a\nmoment I saw the Semantic-Translator in the heart of the fragile, wire\ncylinder. It had the glow of molten steel, pouring from a blast furnace.\n\nThen it was gone. The chute shot back to the front of the machine. The\ntray was empty.\n\nWas it an illusion? I believe that, Bill, because later on, when I\nthought of using the grapple....\n\n\n\nMiss Bertha Kent walked back the gravel trail from the dressing room.\nThe early morning sun was bright and warm, but she held her woolen\nrobe tight across her throat. She tried to avoid looking at the other\ncamps--at the sleepy-eyed women coming out of tents, and the men\nstarting morning fires in the stone rings.\n\nBitterness was etched in acid in her soul. She made herself believe\nit was because she hated Yosemite. The vacation had been such a\ndisappointment. She had expected so much and--as usual--it had all gone\nwrong.\n\nHer hope had been so high when school closed; this year was going to be\ndifferent!\n\n\"Are you going anywhere this summer?\" Miss Emmy asked after the last\nfaculty meeting in June.\n\n\"To Yosemite for a couple of weeks, I think.\"\n\n\"The Park's always crowded. You ought to meet a nice man up there,\nBertha.\"\n\n\"I'm not interested in men,\" Miss Kent had replied frostily. \"I'm a\nbotany teacher and it helps me professionally if I spend part of the\nsummer observing the phenomenon of nature.\"\n\n\"Don't kid me, Bertha. You can drop the fancy lingo, too; school's out.\nYou want a man as much as I do.\"\n\nThat was true, Miss Kent admitted--in the quiet of her own mind.\nNever aloud; never to anyone else. Six years ago, when Bertha Kent\nhad first started to teach, she had been optimistic about it. She\nwanted to marry; she wanted a family of her own--instead of wasting\nher lifetime in a high school classroom playing baby sitter for other\npeople's kids. She had saved her money for all sorts of exotic summer\nvacations--tours, cruises, luxury hotels--but somehow something always\nwent wrong.\n\nTo be sure, she had met men. She was pretty; she danced well; she was\nnever prudish; she liked the out-of-doors. All positive qualities: she\nknew that. The fault lay always with the men. When she first met a\nstranger, everything was fine. Then, slowly, Miss Kent began to see his\nfaults. Men were simply adult versions of the muscle-bound knot-heads\nthe administration loaded into her botany classes.\n\nBertha Kent wanted something better, an ideal she had held in her mind\nsince her childhood. The dream-man was real, too. She had met him\nonce and actually talked to him when she was a child. She couldn't\nremember where; she couldn't recall his face. But the qualities of his\npersonality she knew as she did her own heart. If they had existed once\nin one man, she would find them again, somewhere. That was the miracle\nshe prayed for every summer.\n\nShe thought the miracle had happened again when she first came to\nYosemite.\n\nShe found an open campsite by the river. While she was putting up\nher tent, the man from the camp beside hers came to help. At first\nhe seemed the prototype of everything she hated--a good-looking,\nbeautifully co-ordinated physical specimen, as sharp-witted as a\njellyfish. The front of his woolen shirt hung carelessly unbuttoned.\nShe saw the mat of dark hair on his chest, the sculpted curves of\nsun-tanned muscle. No doubt he considered himself quite attractive.\n\nThen, that evening after the fire-fall, the young man asked her to\ngo with him to the ranger's lecture at Camp Curry. Bertha discovered\nthat he was a graduate physicist, employed by a large, commercial\nlaboratory. They had at least the specialized area of science in\ncommon. By the time they returned from the lecture, they were calling\neach other by first names. The next day Walt asked her to hike up the\nmist trail with him to Nevada Falls.\n\nThe familiar miracle began to take shape. She lay awake a long time\nthat night, looking at the dancing pattern of stars visible through the\nopen flap of her tent. This was it; Walt was the reality of her dream.\nShe made herself forget that every summer for six years the same thing\nhad happened. She always believed she had found her miracle; and always\nsomething happened to destroy it.\n\nFor two days the idyll lasted. The inevitable awakening began the\nafternoon they drove along the Wawona highway to see the Mariposa Grove\nof giant sequoias. They left their car in the parking area and walked\nthrough the magnificent stand of cathedral trees. The trail was steep\nand sometimes treacherous. Twice Walt took her arm to help her. For\nsome reason that annoyed her; finally she told him,\n\n\"I'm quite able to look after myself, Walt.\"\n\n\"So you've told me before.\"\n\n\"After all, I've been hiking most of my life. I know exactly what to\ndo--\"\n\n\"There isn't much you can't take care of for yourself, is there,\nBertha?\" His voice was suddenly very cold.\n\n\"I'm not one of these rattle-brained clinging vines, if that's what you\nmean. I detest a woman who is always yelping to a man for help.\"\n\n\"Independence is one thing, Bertha; I like that in a woman. But somehow\nyou make a man feel totally inadequate. You set yourself up as his\nsuperior in everything.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Walt. I'm quite ready to grant that you know a good\ndeal more about physics than I do.\"\n\n\"Say it right, Bertha. You respect the fact that I hold a PhD.\" He\nsmiled. \"That isn't the same thing as respecting me for a person. I\nknew you didn't need my help on the trail, but it was a normal courtesy\nto offer it. It seems to me it would be just as normal for you to\naccept it. Little things like that are important in relations between\npeople.\"\n\n\"Forget it, Walt.\" She slipped her hand through his. \"There, see? I'll\ndo it just the way you want.\"\n\nShe was determined not to quarrel over anything so trivial, though what\nhe said seemed childish and it tarnished the dream a little. But the\nrest was still good; the miracle could still happen.\n\nYet, in spite of all her effort, they disagreed twice more before they\nleft the Mariposa Grove. Bertha began to see Walt as he was: brilliant,\nno doubt, in the single area of physical science, but basically no\ndifferent from any other man. She desperately wished that she could\nlove him; she earnestly wished that the ideal, fixed so long in her\nmind, might be destroyed.\n\nBut slowly she saw the miracle slip away from her. That night, after\nthe fire-fall, Walt did not ask her to go with him to the lecture.\nMiserable and angry, Bertha Kent went into her tent, but not to sleep.\n\nShe lay staring at the night sky, and thinking how ugly the pin-point\nlights of distant suns were on the velvet void. As the hours passed,\nshe heard the clatter of pans and voices as people at the other\ncampsites retired. She heard Walt when he returned, whistling\ntunelessly. He banged around for nearly an hour in the camp next to\nhers. He dropped a stack of pans; he overturned a box of food; he\ntripped over a tent line. She wondered if he were drunk. Had their\nquarreling driven him to that? Walt must have loved her, then.\n\nAfter a time all the Coleman lanterns in the camp were out. Still\nBertha Kent did not sleep. The acid grief and bitterness tormented\nher with the ghost of another failure, another shattered dream. She\nlistened to the soft music of the flowing stream, the gentle whisper of\nsummer wind in the pines, but it gave her no peace.\n\nSuddenly she heard quiet footsteps and the crackling of twigs behind\nher tent. She was terrified. It must be Walt. If he had come home\ndrunk, he could have planned almost any kind of violence by way of\nrevenge.\n\nThe footsteps moved closer. Bertha shook off the paralysis of fear\nand reached for her electric lantern. She flashed the beam into the\ndarkness. She saw the black bulk of a bear who was pawing through her\nfood box.\n\nShe was so relieved she forgot that a bear might also be a legitimate\ncause of fear. She ran from the tent, swinging the light and shooing\nthe animal away as she would have chased a puppy. The bear swung\ntoward her, roaring and clawing at the air. She backed away. The bear\nswung its paws again, and her food box shattered on the ground, in a\ncrescendo of sound.\n\nBertha heard rapid footsteps under the pines. In the pale moonlight she\nsaw Walt. He was wearing only a pair of red-striped boxer shorts. He\nwas swinging his arms and shouting, but the noise of the falling box\nhad already frightened the bear away.\n\nWalt stood in the moonlight, smiling foolishly.\n\n\"I guess I came too late,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm quite sure the bear would have left of its own accord, Walt.\nThey're always quite tame in the national parks, you know.\" As soon\nas she said it, she knew it was a mistake. Even though he had done\nnothing, it would have cost her little to thank him. The words had come\ninstinctively; she hadn't thought how her answer would affect him. Walt\nturned on his heel stiffly and walked back to his tent.\n\nWith a little forethought--a little kindness--Bertha might even then\nhave rescued her miracle. She knew that. She knew she had lost him now,\nfor good. For the first time in her life she saw the dream as a barrier\nto her happiness, not an ideal. It held her imprisoned; it gave her\nnothing in exchange.\n\nShe slept fitfully for the rest of the night. As soon as the sun was\nup, she pulled on her woolen robe and went to the dressing room to\nwash. She walked back along the gravel path, averting her eyes from\nthe other camps and the men hunched over the smoking breakfast fires.\nShe hated Yosemite. She hated all the people crowded around her. She\nhad made up her mind to pack her tent and head for home. This was just\nanother vacation lost, another year wasted.\n\nShe went into her tent and put on slacks and a bright, cotton blouse.\nThen she sat disconsolate at her camp table surveying the mess the bear\nhad made of her food box. There was nothing that she could rescue. She\ncould drive to the village for breakfast, but the shops wouldn't open\nfor another hour.\n\nBehind her she heard Walt starting his Coleman stove. Yesterday he\nwould have offered her breakfast; now he'd ignored her. All along the\nstream camp fires were blazing in the stone rings. Bertha wondered if\nshe could ask the couple on the other side of her campsite for help.\nThey had attempted to be friendly once before, and Bertha hadn't\nresponded with a great deal of cordiality. They weren't the type she\nliked--a frizzy-headed, coarse-voiced blonde, and a paunchy old man who\nhadn't enough sense to know what a fool he looked parading around camp\nin the faded bathing trunks he wore all day.\n\nSuddenly a light flashed in Bertha's face. A metal shovel slid out of\nnothingness and deposited a tiny, rectangular box on the table. For a\nlong minute she stared at the box stupidly, vaguely afraid. Her mind\nmust be playing her tricks. Such things didn't happen.\n\nShe reached out timidly and touched the box. It seemed real enough. A\nminiature radio of some sort, with a two-inch speaker. She turned the\ndials. She heard a faint humming.\n\nThe coarse-voiced blonde came toward the table.\n\n\"We just heard what happened last night, Miss Kent,\" she said. \"Me and\nGeorge. About the bear, I mean.\"\n\nBertha forced a smile. \"It made rather a shambles, didn't it?\"\n\n\"Gee, you can't make breakfast out of a mess like this. Why don't you\ncome and eat with us?\"\n\nThe blonde went on talking, apologizing for what she was serving and\nat the same time listing it with a certain pride. Strangely, Miss Kent\nheard not one voice, but two. The second came tinnily from the little\nbox on the table,\n\n\"You poor, dried-up old maid. That guy who's been hanging around would\nhave been over long before this, if you knew the first thing about\nbeing nice to a man.\"\n\nBertha gasped. \"Really, if that's the way you feel--\"\n\n\"Why, honey, I just asked you over for breakfast,\" the blonde answered;\nat the same time the voice from the machine said,\n\n\"I suppose George and me ain't good enough for you. O.K. by me, sister.\nI didn't really want you to come anyway.\"\n\nTrembling, Miss Kent stood up. \"I've never been so insulted!\"\n\n\"What's eating you, Miss Kent?\" The blonde seemed genuinely puzzled,\nbut again the voice came from the plastic box,\n\n\"The old maid's off her rocker. You'd think she was reading my mind.\"\n\nSwitching her trim little hips, the blonde walked back to her own camp.\nBertha Kent dropped numbly on the bench, staring at the ugly box.\n\"Reading my mind,\" the woman had said. Somehow the machine had done\nprecisely that, translating the blonde's spoken words into the real,\nemotional meaning behind them. It was a terrifying gadget. Bertha was\nhypnotized by its potential horror--like the brutal, devastating truth\nspoken by a child.\n\nA camper walked past on the road, waving at Miss Kent and calling out\na cheerful good morning. But again the machine read the real meaning\nbehind the pleasant words.\n\n\"So you've finally lost your man, Miss Kent. The way you dished out the\norders, it's a wonder he stayed around as long as he did. And a pity:\nyou're an attractive woman. You should make some man a good wife.\"\n\nThey all thought that. The whole camp had been watching her, laughing\nat her. Bertha felt helpless and alone. She needed--wanted--someone\nelse; it surprised her when she faced that fact.\n\nThen it dawned on her: the camper was right; the blonde was right. She\nhad lost Walt through her own ridiculous bull-headedness. In order to\nassert herself. To be an individualist, she had always thought. And\nwhat did that matter, if it imposed this crushing loneliness?\n\nFor a moment a kind of madness seized her. It was the diabolical\nmachine that was tormenting her, not the truth it told. She snatched a\npiece of her broken food box and struck at the plastic case blindly.\nThere was a splash of fire; the gadget broke.\n\nShe saw Walt look up from his stove. She saw him move toward her. But\nshe stood paralyzed by a shattering trauma of pain. The voice still\ncame from the speaker, and this time it was her own. Her mind was\nstripped naked; she saw herself whole, unsheltered by the protective\nveneer of rationalization.\n\nAnd she knew the pattern of the dream-man she had loved since her\nchildhood; she knew why the dream had been self-defeating.\n\nFor the idealization was her own father. That impossible paragon\ncreated by the worship of a child.\n\nThe shock was its own cure. She was too well-balanced to accept the\ntempting escape of total disorientation. Grimly she fought back the\ntide of madness, and in that moment she found maturity. She ran toward\nWalt, tears of gratitude in her eyes. She felt his arms around her, and\nshe clung to him desperately.\n\n\"I was terrified; I needed you, Walt; I never want to be alone again.\"\n\n\"Needed me?\" he repeated doubtfully.\n\n\"I love you.\" After a split-second's hesitation, she felt his lips warm\non hers.\n\nFrom the corner of her eye she saw a chute dart out of nowhere and\nscoop up the broken plastic box from the camp table. They both vanished\nagain. That was a miracle, too, she supposed; but not nearly as\nimportant as hers.\n\nThen the reason of a logical mind asserted its own form of realism:\nof course, none of it had happened. The mind-reading gadget had been\na device created in her own subconscious, a psychological trick to\nby-pass the dream that had held her imprisoned. She knew enough\npsychology to understand that.\n\nShe ran her fingers through Walt's dark hair and repeated softly,\n\n\"I love you, Walt Gordon.\"\n\n\n\nWas it an illusion? I believe that, Bill, because later on, when I\nthought of using the grapple, I brought the Semantic-Translator back\nfrom nowhere. Apparently the smaller gadget had been in the console or\nbehind it. I hadn't seen it when I searched, because my eyes had been\nhurt by the glare of light.\n\nIn the process the Translator somehow got twisted around, for the chute\ndragged it back vertically through the coil of wire. It touched the\nwall of the cylinder, and the whole machine exploded.\n\nIt was impossible to save anything from the wreckage. But as a\nphysicist I assure you, Bill, the transposition of matter into light\nis, in terms of our present science, a physical impossibility. It is\ncertainly not the sort of invention that could have been produced by a\nsenile old man, pottering around in a home laboratory. The only thing I\nregret is that I had no opportunity to examine the Semantic-Translator,\nbut I'm sure it would have proved just as much nonsense.\n\nI'm going up to Yosemite tomorrow for a couple of weeks. If you want\nany further details on the Price inventory, look me up at the office\nwhen I come home.\n\nYours,\n\nWalt Gordon\n\n\n\n\n",
