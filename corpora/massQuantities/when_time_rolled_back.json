    "body": "Long before Rog found the mysterious, shining ball back in the\nmountains, he knew he was far different from the rest of his tribe that\nlived along the river. He knew it because he didn't think the same way\nthey did, and because there was a difference even in their appearance.\n\nSarak, who was the Old Man of the tribe as well as his sire, and Monah,\nRog's mother, were short and heavy and thickly covered with hair. Rog\nwas taller and straighter, and endowed with much less hair. Too, his\nface was much broader through the cheekbones and less heavy-looking\naround the mouth. There was only one other in the tribe who seemed to\nbe of the same physical cast as Rog, and that was Lo, a young woman who\ndwelt with her family in Sarak's cave.\n\nThough the stalwart, blond young man took an active part in all the\nwork of the tribe--hunting, skinning, tool-making--there were times\nwhen he would detach himself from the rest as though he were a creature\nof a higher world viewing a savage orgy.\n\nSuch a time was the delirious madness of eating after the lucky kill\nof a giant mammoth. All the able-bodied men of the tribe would aid in\ndragging the great, quiet animal into the clearing beside the river,\nand then, to the cries of men, women, and children, huge hunks of flesh\nwould be torn off and devoured by all. The orgy did not cease until no\none was able to stand without falling.\n\nBut Rog and Lo would stand back in the shadows and watch gravely,\ngnawing passively on smaller pieces of meat.\n\nThe others of the tribe realized that Rog and Lo were somehow different\nfrom them. And because of the young man's tremendous strength and\nbecause he was the son of the Old Man, he was not molested. But\nsecretly the slow-thinking men and women classed him with Ta, the\nhalf-witted boy who sat all day playing with a stick.\n\nNone of them, not even the thoughtful Lo, ever stopped to wonder how\nfar back their ancestors had lived in this spot. Nor did they care. But\nRog found himself wondering if life had always been like this, or if it\nhad once been superior or inferior to their mode of life. Sometimes he\nwould grow curious enough to wander far down the river, or off into the\nhills, alone.\n\nIt was on one of those excursions, prompted by an increasing\ndissatisfaction with the life of the tribe, that Rog wandered back four\nor five ranges from the cave dwellings. He had just sat down to eat\nsome of the dried meat he had brought along when his eye was caught by\na glint of flashing metal off through the dense woods.\n\nStartled, he leaped up and made his way nearer. Within ten minutes he\nwas standing aghast, staring at a great, gleaming globe of silver, half\nburied in the soft, moldy ground. He was terrified, for an instant, and\nbroke into panic-stricken flight before this thing that none of the\naborigines had ever seen. Then Rog's overpowering curiosity brought him\ncreeping back.\n\nIt was fifty times as tall as he was, just the half of it he could\nsee. It sparkled in the sunlight like white fire. Then, down near the\nground, Rog saw a round cut in the smooth surface. Something told him\nthis was the way inside the ball, though there was no reason why he\nshould not have believed it was anything but solid. But there was an\ninner urge that made him approach gingerly and take hold of the long\ncross-bar that was set into the door.\n\nEagerly he pulled at it. Nothing happened. He pushed, twisted, shoved,\nand still the thing would not budge. Then a gleam of comprehension\nflickered in his eyes. He grasped both ends of the bar and turned it\nthe way a plumber turns a pipe-cutter. It moved!\n\nThe round entrance swivelled about on threads that were glass-smooth,\nuntil suddenly it swung aside on a hinge. Rog gasped and poked his head\ninside. He was so amazed that for a couple of minutes he could only\nstand in the portal, gaping.\n\n\n\nThe ball was divided into floors, apparently, for there was a spiral\nstaircase in the middle that went up through the high ceiling, and a\ncontinuation of the stairway going down into the lower half of it. From\nsome small globes hanging from the ceiling a soft radiation was thrown\ninto the room. There were gleaming tables and cabinets and shelves of\nmystifying apparatus that Rog's eyes had never seen.\n\nAt last he ventured inside. He went from one glass-covered table to the\nnext, frowning at the things he saw. He could make nothing of them.\n\nThere were twenty tables, and each bore a maze of strange symbols\non its top. He was at a loss to divine what they meant, until he\ndiscovered that at the bottom of each chart there was a picture of a\nglobe, with a tiny red arrow pointing to a section of it. Then he knew.\nThe tables were supposed to tell him what was to be found on each floor.\n\nAll this Rog knew, although he had never seen metal before, or glass,\nor heard of a floor. But somehow he felt more at home in here than he\ndid in the cave with Sarak and Monah. With perfect confidence he went\nto the staircase and climbed to the first floor.\n\nA low, shining fence leading from the stairway made it plain that he\nwas to follow inside it and view each exhibit as he went. Rog went to\nthe first table, and within five minutes he was plunged into a maze of\nconjectures and mysteries that made his aboriginal brain ache.\n\nThe first table bore a number of short groups of symbols, completely\nlost on him. There were flowing, cursive characters; then a line\nof wedge-shaped pictures; line after line of characters differing\nonly slightly; and finally, at the very bottom, something he could\nunderstand.\n\nThere was pictured a figure that brought a quick smile of apprehension\nto Rog's face--an old man, bowed with age. Beside him was a young\nchild, enclosed in a red circle that set him off from the old man. A\nword leaped to his lips.... Not, perhaps, the word that the artist had\nintended, but close enough.\n\n\"Beginning!\" was the thought that came from his lips.\n\n\n\nAfter that the messages in the words and pictures made more sense\nto him. Stupefied, trembling with excitement at this thing that was\nhappening to him, he went on and on.\n\nHe ignored the symbols as mere decorations, and read the pictures,\nhurrying from one group to the next. He stared long and amazed at\namazingly life-like representations of the life of a tribe such as his\nown. The men and women even looked like his did--short, squat, hairy.\nThe scenes showed them killing great animals somewhat similar to the\nones on whose meat they lived, portrayed them chipping flint holes, and\ndoing the other dozens of things life demanded of them.\n\nBut as he went on the life changed.\n\nFrom cave-houses the migration was to peculiar dwellings of poles and\nboughs, making box-like affairs in which men and women lived. The\ntribe-folk, even, changed. They grew more upright and less hairy, and\ntheir faces looked something like the reflection that stared back at\nRog from quiet forest pools.\n\nThe message of the pictures did not by any means unfold fully to\nRog, but from the chain of scenes he began to grasp something. Life\nsteadily became more and more complex, as though it were working toward\nsomething--with a purpose. Men grew taller, their dwellings bigger,\ntheir weapons stranger and apparently more efficient. He saw small\ntribal conflicts broaden into great wars between numbers of tribes.\n\nHe gaped at inventions which he could not begin to comprehend. Before\nhis startled gaze caves gave way to great dwelling-places so large\nthat men looked like ants beside them. He had to smile at the fanciful\npicturization of a man flying through the air in a fantastic machine.\nBut as Rog neared the end of the exhibit, he realized that the story,\nif story it was, did not satisfy him.\n\nIn his crude, barbaric way, he had great visions of improving life so\nthat death was not such a stern, everpresent reality, and men would\nhave time for things other than eating and sleeping and mating. He was\na philosopher, if such a thing were conceivable of a man who lived on\nraw meat. And this story did not appeal to him, for as far as he could\ntell men grew more and more dissatisfied, instead of contented....\n\nTerrible wars were shown to him. Violent death stalked the streets\nof the beautiful cities. War after war piled on top of struggling\ncivilization until at last a conflict that seemed to embrace every\nshred of man's life took place. After that there were scenes of cities\nutterly deserted, crumbling into ruins. The final picture made Rog gasp\nwith shock.\n\nThey showed ten men laboring on a great steel ball, filling it with\ntiny miniatures and statues and boxes. The last picture was of one man\nlying under a transparent glass dome at the bottom of the ball.\n\nRog was suddenly frightened. He turned and fled back down the stairs\nand out the door, and plunged into the forest--\n\n\n\nHe said nothing to the rest of the tribe that day. Somehow he knew he\nmust guard his secret with his life. If the others found what he had\ndiscovered, they would crowd into it and tear to shreds these things\nthat he treasured, simply through love of destruction. When he thought\nof that, his fists clenched and hatred blazed in his eyes. The ball\nmust be kept safe, so that he could learn what it meant. It meant more\nthan life itself, more than Lo, even, that he should solve the message\nin the shining globe.\n\nBut the next day he found time to sit by the river with Lo. \"You were\ngone yesterday,\" she said. \"Where?\"\n\nRog's heart leaped into his mouth. He looked down in sudden confusion.\n\"Only down the river,\" he lied. \"I went to hunt roots.\"\n\nHer questioning eyes told him she knew he was lying. But she was wise,\nand held her tongue.\n\nAfter a long time he could hold himself in no longer. \"Do you ever\nwonder,\" he asked intensely, \"why we live this way? I mean--have men\nalways lived like this, in caves, killing their meat and gorging\nthemselves on it, and then starving until they killed again?\"\n\nLo's dark eyes met his boring glance, but she said nothing. She was\nfeminine enough, and civilized enough, to realize it wasn't an answer\nhe wanted, but an audience.\n\nIn a moment he went on. \"You and I aren't like the others, Lo. The Old\nMan and all the rest of the people aren't happy unless they are eating.\nBut we can be happy talking, and ... wondering.\"\n\nShe smiled at him in happy understanding. \"Luk-no says you are lazy,\"\nshe said na\u00c3\u00afvely. \"But I know you work hard even when you are quiet.\nElse how would you find things to make like the Thing that Floats?\"\n\nHe warmed at her mention of his raft. It was only a short while ago\nthat he had conceived the idea of tying a bundle of logs together to\nferry things across the river, but now it was in daily use. But when\nhis mind rested on Luk-no, he scowled.\n\n\"Some day I will kill him,\" he promised savagely. \"Always he\ninterferes.\"\n\nLuk-no was a great, stubby trunk of a man who resented Lo's interest in\nRog and took every chance to get in his way. His greatest delight was\nto carry tales of his laziness to Sarak, who would promptly beat his\nson with a club. Such treatment rankled under Rog's skin.\n\nThen he forgot his hatred of the black-browed one in contemplation of\nother things. \"I do not like the way we live,\" he said simply. \"Our\ncaves are cold and sometimes wet. Our weapons are scarcely able to kill\nthe animals we need before they kill us. I do not like the way the Old\nMan rules us, telling us what we can do and what we cannot do. Why\nshouldn't I make better things for myself if I want, instead of being\nbeaten for not working? Some day....\"\n\nLo caught up the thread of thought quickly. \"I know,\" she nodded. \"Some\nday you will challenge Sarak and kill him. Then you will be the Old\nMan! You will be the one who rules!\"\n\n\"So that is what you two talk of! I knew it was not how to get food for\nthe tribe!\" The voice was triumphant and harsh, close behind them.\n\nThey were on their feet in an instant, whirling to face the\nbrutally-built man who had come up behind them. It was Luk-no. His\nlittle red-rimmed eyes were alight with anticipation.\n\n\"You came at the wrong moment,\" Rog growled sullenly. \"We were not\ntalking of that, but Lo grew over-enthusiastic.\"\n\n\"Well, and won't the Old Man be glad to hear this?\" Luk-no taunted.\n\"When I tell him, he will cave your head in like an acorn.\"\n\nRog's face was black with fury. \"If you tell Sarak what you heard,\" he\nsaid tensely, \"I will take your dirty throat in my hands and break it.\nThen I'll gouge your prying eyes out. I'll tear your tongue out so you\ncan never tell anything else you hear again. Or perhaps I will just do\nit now!\" He took a menacing step towards the smaller, burlier man, his\nclub resting on his shoulder.\n\nLuk-no cringed, essaying a grin. \"You are too quick to anger!\" he\nprotested. \"It was a joke.\"\n\n\"A joke,\" Rog mocked. \"Like the time you toppled a rock on the head of\none of the others who wished to mate with Lo! I don't like your jokes,\ndirty one. Go back to your caterpillar-grubbing before I change my\nmind.\"\n\nBut as Luk-no slunk away, he felt icy chills run down his back. He must\nbe more careful! Here he had been on the point of telling everything to\nLo. What would have resulted if Luk-no had heard! The globe, perhaps,\nwould have been discovered and ruined!\n\nAnd Rog, stalking away by himself, knew that he must be triply careful,\nfor somehow he sensed that in that shining ball was contained the whole\nfuture of the tribe....\n\n\n\nIn the weeks to come he made many trips back to the sphere. With every\nvisit his wonder grew.\n\nBy intuition and study he became convinced that the place was a\nrepository in which some race long dead--a \"tribe\" was his only word\nfor them--had sought to preserve the knowledge of their civilization\nfor those to come later. His agile mind told him why it had been\nnecessary.\n\nMankind had worked itself up to the point where it had too much\nleisure, and turned its energy to the destruction of others. The\ninevitable result was self-destruction. But the ten he had seen in the\npictures stole away and created this museum of history and science, to\naid mankind when it must again struggle upward.\n\nUnder Luk-no's subtle whispering the tribe grew incensed against Rog\nand watched him constantly, seeking to learn where he went on the\ndays he was absent. They resented the things he \"invented\" with such\nregularity. Little did they realize he was but copying things he saw in\nthe sphere.\n\nThe thing that astounded them most, even Rog himself, was the wheel.\n\nHe hacked a section of a log into a rough cylinder about three feet\nthick and bored a hole through it for an axle. Two of these \"wheels\" he\njoined together by a peeled pole and made a crude sort of cart, more,\nperhaps, like a wheelbarrow. But the simple contraption did the work of\nmany men in hauling rocks and meat. Had it not been for the tremendous\njealousy it aroused among other young men in the settlement, he would\nhave been acclaimed a hero.\n\nAnother day he fashioned a device consisting of a bent stick held in\na permanent arc by a piece of rawhide. When a notched branch, skinned\nclean of bark and twigs, was launched by the bowstring, it flew with\nsufficient force to kill a squirrel. Rog was as delighted as a child\nwith his bow and arrow, and spent many hours practicing with it.\n\nThere were other things in the museum that brought deep lines to his\nforehead. He was already beginning to comprehend the principle of the\nwater-wheel and the pulley, but when he saw a man hanging from a great\nbag high in the air, or a hunter killing a bear by pointing a smoking\nstick at it, he was stupefied.\n\n\n\nJust six weeks after his discovery of the ball, he found something that\nfroze him with sheer terror, that sent him running away, vowing never\nto return.\n\nOn this day he had gone down the stairs through a number of floors,\nuntil he came to a room in the very bottom of the sphere. The door to\nthe chamber was closed. It was an unusual door, of a gleaming material\nthat made him blink, and had a single character in the center of it:\na red circle from which a small sector had been removed. The sector\nhovered over the gap, as if asking to be replaced.\n\nRog pushed the door open and went in, suddenly stopped. His face froze,\nthen brightened with eagerness. Hastily he went to the bubble-like dome\nof glass in the middle of the room.\n\nThen he was standing rigid with shock. On a low couch under the glass\nbell lay an old man clad in flowing, white garments. But he was\ndifferent from the tribe's old men. He was taller and frailer. His brow\nwas lofty, instead of being crowded down over his eyebrows, and his\nexpression was serene in death.\n\nRog shoved his nose against the glass, studying the dignified figure.\nHe wished, suddenly, that the old man were not dead, for he could\nundoubtedly explain all these things to him that had him puzzling so\nhopelessly. At last his gaze wandered to the maze of machines at the\nhead of the couch.\n\nThere was nothing there that he could begin to understand. Just a\nbattery of glass and metal and tubes. Two red wires led from the\nmachinery to a board on which were a number of dials and things that\nRog scarcely gave a second glance.\n\nThen, all at once, he stiffened. His eyes fastened on a shining red\ncircle of metal, exactly the same as the symbol on the door. And there\nwas a section out of it, lying there asking him to put it back in!\n\n\n\nNow he went to it and lifted the heavy little bit of red stuff. It had\nprongs that fitted into corresponding holes in the rest of the circle\nwhich was firmly fixed to the board. Rog knew he was supposed to shove\nthe sector into place. His fingers were trembling as he hesitated.\nSuddenly he bent forward and pushed the prongs home!\n\nThere was an instant of utter silence. His primitive mind told him that\nthis was a moment of moments, though he knew not why. Gradually a low\nhumming told him his action had taken results. The machinery glowed and\nwheels began to turn slowly, then faster and faster, until they were\nspinning discs of silver.\n\nRog's eyes fastened on the ancient's face. Why, he did not know.\nPerhaps he was asking him to answer.... He scowled. Were his eyes\ndeceiving him, or had the placid white face become flushed?\n\n\"Agh!\" A hoarse bark of terror burst from Rog's throat. The old man's\neyes were open and he was looking straight at him!\n\nThe young aborigine had seen enough. He turned and fled, caring for\nnothing but his own life now.\n\n\n\nFor a week he was afraid even to think of what he had seen. His mind\nwas outraged by the thought of the dead returning to life.\n\nHe worked so hard with the tribe now that they were amazed at the\nchange in him. It was growing on towards winter, and stores of roots,\nedible weeds, and dried meat were crowded into the smoky, dark caves in\nwhich they lived. The winters had been growing so heavy that the Old\nMan had even mentioned moving farther south, where they had observed\nbirds and certain animals went in cold weather. This winter they were\ntaking no chance of starving. Great supplies of food were being put in\nlong ahead of time.\n\nBut in spite of Rog's industry, Luk-no found time to run him down,\nsecretly, to Sarak. The two of them would mumble between themselves,\nLuk-no furtive and prattling, the Old Man smoldering with righteous\nindignation. And presently the Old Man, who was actually only about\nfifteen years older than Rog, would take it upon himself to chastise\nhim. His great, bulging muscles would strain as he cudgelled him.\n\nRog sweltered under the mistreatment ... but this trouble was as\nnothing compared to the burning curiosity to know what he had done the\nlast time he went to the globe. Even Lo could not be let in on such a\nsecret. She, too, would class him with Ta, then.\n\nThe day came when he could stand it no longer.\n\nAlmost without his own volition he found himself far back in the hills,\nmaking swiftly towards the museum. He did not rush in as heretofore\nwhen he reached it. He crept up and poked his head inside the portal,\nwide-eyed and breathing hard. There was the sound of a twig's breaking\nbehind him, and he whirled, flattening out against the wall.\n\n\"Do not be afraid.\" It was the smiling patriarch who spoke. \"I am\nJohann Adam, the man you restored to life. I am here to help you.\"\n\nBut Rog could not understand the strange, musical sounds he made. He\ncontinued to crouch there, waiting.\n\nThe old man spread his hands. \"I have slept long, if you represent man\nof today. But follow me.\" And he gestured to the boy, passing on into\nthe sphere.\n\nThen there followed an hour of the most thrilling, most baffling,\nconversation he had ever known. Johann Adam took a big pad and a\nwriting-stick and made picture after picture, while Rog crouched near\nhim, fearing to stay, and yet hating the thought of missing anything by\nleaving. The first time Adam extended the pad to him to see what he had\nwritten, he shrank back and almost ran away.\n\nSomehow he knew that it was ridiculous, his being afraid of a man so\nmuch feebler than he, and he stiffened his feeble courage. But there\nwas a tiny voice inside him that whispered that the ancient had a power\nthat transcended that of mere muscles. Rog remembered the smoking\nsticks that killed bears....\n\nFinally he glanced at the pad, and then took it. The diagram was a\nrepetition of the old man and child in the chart in the room above. A\nsmile claimed his features. He pointed upward and gave the pad back.\n\nAdam was pleased. He seemed to inventory Rog's quick eyes and his\nsmooth, broad brow. Then he was writing again. The younger man's fear\nbroke down completely under the force of his desire for learning.\nWithin a few minutes he was sitting on the floor beside Johann Adam,\nnodding and grinning and sometimes frowning in puzzlement. But a story\nwas unfolding to him. He was learning how the sphere happened to be.\n\nLaboriously he pieced together the fact that Adam and nine\nother men had foreseen what was to happen to the earth and its\nsuper-civilization. Knowing that destruction of modern culture was\non the way, they had sought to preserve some part of it for humanity\nwhen--and if--men emerged from the darkness at some future time.\n\nThey had constructed the globe and filled it with every scrap of\nknowledge known to man. Then they constructed the last room of all, the\nchamber in which Adam was to lie awaiting the renewal of his suspended\nlife, or the death that would be complete.\n\nOn the eve of the last of the terrible, cataclysmic wars that burned\nmankind from earth like a searing flame from outer space, Johann Adam\nentered the globe and the others went back, to die.\n\nTheir supposition had been correct. The last great invention of the war\ngods, a corrosive gas, had got out of control. Within a space of years\nmen were wiped from the face of earth.\n\nWhat happened then Adam could not say. Perhaps man had struggled\nup from the bottom of evolution's ladder again; perhaps a tribe of\nhigh-type apes had been left after the catastrophe, and were now Rog's\npeople, developed by a few thousand years. At any rate, the world was\nagain stumbling through the dark shadows of the Stone Age. And from\nthat murky period civilization was slowly crawling back to its former\ngolden age.\n\nAnd Rog knew who would take the lead in the advance. He himself, under\nthe guidance of Johann Adam, would be the Old Man of all Old Men! He\nwould be instrumental in leading his people away from the paths that\nwould deter their progress. All this he would do, with Lo at his side!\n\nHe took the drawing-stick himself, then, and made what crude signs he\ncould to tell of the strained conditions at the caves. Adam frowned\nand nodded slowly. Clearly he was worried. The death of this man, whom\nhe knew was hundreds of years ahead of his time, might nullify all his\nchances of aiding the world.\n\nThen a gleam of hope lighted his eyes. By pictures he showed Rog\nwhat to do. He was to bring Lo with him and stay here in the globe\nuntil he had learned enough to be able to convince the tribe of his\nsuperiority. Until the day when he must be recognized as the leader of\nthem all!\n\nHe was reluctant to leave Adam, and yet eager to carry out his\ninstructions. Trembling with anticipation, he took his clumsy club over\nhis shoulder and ran back through the trees towards the river....\n\nHe came back to the caves to find an angry group awaiting him. Sarak\nstood at the entrance to the cave, leaning on his club. He was an\nimposing figure in his anger. His sloping shoulders bulged massively\nunder a mat of black hair, and his short body was tight with muscles\ndrawn hard by hatred.\n\n\"Sluggard!\" he spat at Rog. \"You run off and hide, do you, while others\nwork? Already black clouds gather, but you let old men and women, as\nwell as the younger ones, find food to keep the fat on your bones\nduring the long winter.\"\n\nRog stiffened with anxiety. He saw Lo watching him wide-eyed and white\nof face, and realized Luk-no was grinning at his predicament. He\ndecided on a bold lie. \"I was stalking a deer,\" he said. \"I followed it\nfar into the hills, but could not get close enough to kill it. Had I\nsucceeded, it would have fed more mouths than what roots I could have\ngathered.\"\n\nThe Old Man snorted. \"You do not even lie well,\" he snarled. \"You carry\nonly a club. Did you think to get close enough to kill it with that?\"\nHis close-set, red-rimmed eyes blazed. \"Where is your spear?\"\n\n\"I--I lost it,\" Rog faltered.\n\n\"Lost it, did you?\" shouted Sarak. \"Well, I have not lost my club,\nsmooth-faced one! Feel its anger, now, and remember, when you feel like\nsleeping in the forest instead of working.\"\n\nHis wide mouth was distorted, baring ugly black snags of teeth as he\nadvanced. The thick cudgel, weighted with a stone, came up over his\nhead.\n\nFor a moment Rog considered springing in to battle. His mind weighed\nhis chances. Against Sarak, perhaps, he might have had a chance of\ncoming out alive, but the tribe was incensed against him now. Luk-no\nwould lead them against him should he vanquish the bloodthirsty Old Man.\n\nThen blows were raining down upon his head and back. As best he could,\nhe warded them off with his club, but the blood sprang from half a\ndozen wounds in the first few seconds. He went to his knees, dazed and\nbleeding. Sarak shouted and screamed and danced, in savage enjoyment of\nhis tribal right to punish, justifiably or not. His thick lips gleamed\nwith saliva.\n\nAnd Rog bit his lip against the pain and bore it. He ground down the\nhate welling up within his breast, because he must come out of this\nalive. Whatever it cost him, he must endure it, or the secret of the\nmuseum might die with Johann Adam. A bitter laugh was torn from his\nlips at the thought that his only motive in living was to help the\ntribe!\n\nThe wall of leering faces swam before his vision. The ruler's\ncountenance loomed before them all, twisted with savagery. His\nbreathing was stertorous, rasping through clenched teeth. At last Rog\ncould stand no more. The club fell from his hands and he sprawled on\nhis face in the cavern.\n\n\n\nSometime during the night he awoke. His body was a mass of bruises and\ncuts. It gave him excruciating agony to force his head from the floor,\nbut he did so, and cast a slow glance about him. Then he saw what he\nwanted.\n\nPainfully he inched himself to Lo's side and aroused her, placing\nhis hand quickly over her mouth to stifle the outcry. \"It's me,\" he\nwhispered. \"Rog. Listen to me, Lo. I want you to go away with me!\"\n\nInstantly the girl was wide awake. \"Go away!\" she echoed.\n\nHe nodded. \"Not for good. Just for a few moons. Then we will come\nback, and I will become the Old Man!\"\n\nNow Lo was trembling with excitement. Before she could question him, he\nbent nearer and whispered, \"Pay attention to what I say, but don't ask\nquestions. We are going back into the forest, to a great, shining stone\nI found. And we must go tomorrow, as soon as the tribe is not noticing\nus.\"\n\nThen, hurriedly, he told her of the sphere. She was puzzled, almost\ninclined to doubt him, but the energy and sincerity of his manner\ntold her he was not lying. A groan from one of the sleepers sent him\nscuttling back to his place, to lie there sleepless until the sun came\nup and shot long, golden lances into the cave.\n\nHe was so tense in the morning that he could scarcely force himself to\npretend to work. Lo stayed near him. Fear and hope battled within him.\nFailure now would mean that Johann Adam would wait in vain, out in the\nforest, for him to come back. He would know Rog could not help him, at\nlast, and then ... what?\n\nHe would become older rapidly, for he had many years on his shoulders\nalready. Time would almost surely cut him down before he could find\nanyone in any of the tribes intelligent enough to know he was not a\ndevil. A cold sweat broke out on his forehead at the thought of so much\nknowledge being wasted. Though he could not know it, his concern for\nthe secrets of the museum marked him as the first scientist in many\nthousands of years.\n\nWhen the sun had climbed high over the tops of the leafy trees Rog saw\nhis chance. The others had scattered, paying him little attention. In a\nflash he had darted to Lo's side and hissed, \"Now! We must run fast!\"\n\n\n\nThey crept to the edge of the clearing and then sprang into the thick,\ncool darkness of the underbrush. Under the swift feet the miles slipped\npast. Rog was tense and anxious, Lo eager as a child and a little\nfrightened. She did not know what he did: That upon their reaching the\nsphere safely depended thousands of years of evolution.\n\nAnd then, almost without warning, they were springing into the small\ncircle of bare ground surrounding the shining ball of metal. They\nstopped just a few feet away from the closed door and stood hand in\nhand while Rog shouted.\n\nAfter a moment the bar across the portal began to turn. Then it had\nswung open ... and in that same instant something took place that\ndrained every drop of blood from Rog's face and left him shivering in\ndumb despair.\n\nNot fifty feet behind them a confused shouting arose, and to their\nshocked gazes were revealed the running forms of a dozen of the\ntribesmen, led by Sarak, himself!\n\nA groan of despair came from the lips of Johann Adam. Lo sank to the\nground and waited for the clubs to end her life with that of Rog.\nBut Rog was too stupefied to do or say anything. His club hung from\nnerveless fingers. The sight of twelve men rushing upon him seemed not\nto register in his mind.\n\nThen he moved. The club swung up over one shoulder, and he stepped\nforward one pace. His words carried strongly across the intervening\ndistance.\n\n\"Wait!\" he shouted. \"I would do battle with Sarak alone. One so weak\nand stupid as he has no right to rule!\"\n\nThey stopped. It was a young man's right, if he were so foolish, to\nchallenge the Old Man to battle. It meant that his wisdom and strength\nwere questioned, and only by a battle to the death could it be settled.\nSarak roared his acceptance, and the others were bound to wait.\n\nHe strode from the knot of savage tribesmen, cudgel lofted over his\nhead. Taunts and threats crowded his flabby lips.\n\nIt was a daring move that Rog was making. Unless he challenged Sarak\nand demanded a fight alone with him, they would be massacred. Perhaps\nif he won, the tribe would still exact payment, for Luk-no was at the\nhead of the men, waiting for his chance to avenge himself.\n\nThey crashed together with a sickening sound of stone on flesh. Blood\nspurted from Rog's head, where Sarak's club had grazed him. The sight\nof the blood brought a scream of triumph from the Old Man, he raised\nthe weapon again in his stubby hands.\n\nRog released the club with his right hand and shot a hard fist into\nthe other's face. Thrown off guard, Sarak had to fall back as his son\nswept in upon him. His years of experience saved him as he warded off\nevery blow expertly. He drove in a hard sweep of the cudgel that rocked\nagainst the younger man's shoulder.\n\nAgain Sarak bludgeoned his way in, driving Rog back before him,\nbleeding and dazed. A sob of despair choked Rog. It was more than his\nlife that was at stake today.\n\nJohann Adam's fingers were locked in the folds of his garments as he\nwatched the struggle. He knew as well as Rog what the stakes were. And\nit was a heartbreaking fact for him to realize that he was powerless to\nhelp. Interference by him, even if it resulted in victory for the boy,\nwould mean the tribe would never accept him. Only as a tribal member\ncould he aid.\n\nAround the fighters a great crowd was collecting. The rest of the tribe\nhad run up just after Sarak and Luk-no, and now they crowded in to\nwatch the deadly combat. Their screams of hate filled the quiet forest.\n\nRog fought with desperation. In strength he was a match for his\nbloodthirsty sire, but he lacked the years of experience behind the Old\nMan's clubbing. He was forced to give ground time after time, wading\nin with swinging bludgeon only to be brought to his knees by a clever\nblow over the back of the neck.\n\nSweat streamed down his forehead and blinded him, mingling with blood.\nHis ribs ached terribly from a blow that had cracked several on one\nside, and one leg was wrenched so it would hardly support him. But\nstill his shoulders writhed to his efforts to give Sarak a death blow.\n\nSuddenly, as he backed to the very edge of the crowd, he saw a shadow\nrise swiftly over his head, in the black images cast on the ground.\nFor a moment the battle with Sarak was forgotten in the more immediate\ndanger of being clubbed from behind. He ducked.\n\nSomething smacked into the ground at his feet, and a man, his balance\nlost by the blow's missing, lunged past. Luk-no stumbled over the\nboulder that had almost cost Rog his life. In a flash the intended\nvictim's club was raised and brought down on his back. With a scream of\npain the black-browed one went down.\n\nThe Old Man had not been napping. As Rog's attention wavered he\nleaped in close and pulled his cudgel around behind him for a vicious\nroundhouse swipe that would crush his adversary's head. Rog's only\nwarning was his hissing breath. He squatted down quickly, just as the\nstone swept over him, so close it raised the hackles on his neck.\n\nIn the next moment Rog's chance came. Sarak lunged off balance and\ntwisted desperately around to recover it. Rog took one deep breath ...\nand then he leaped.\n\nHis club hissed through the air as he put all his force into a final\neffort. There was a solid crunching sound as the sharp rock connected\nwith Sarak's skull. The Old Man went down without a sound, and he was\nOld Man no longer....\n\nIn the moment's hush that fell over the group, Rog went swiftly back\nto Lo and Johann Adam. He stood between them and raised both arms for\nattention.\n\n\"Is there any other who wishes to be ruler?\" he shouted.\n\nThere was not a sound. Luk-no crouched where he had fallen.\n\nA glad tide rushed up in Rog's breast. He had won! He was the Old Man\nnow, himself, free to do as he wished, and with the power to make the\ntribe do what he knew was best for them. He spoke once more.\n\n\"Then, know this--I am your ruler and you are my people. But this old\nman beside me is far wiser than any of us. You will follow my wishes--I\nwill follow his. You do not know what this means now, but you will\nlater.\"\n\nA few feet away the hapless Luk-no still crouched and awaited the\ndeath blow that was his due. Then Rog performed the first act of mercy\nmankind had known in many hundreds of years.\n\nSharply he said to him, \"Get up. I will not kill you because I do not\ndeign to dirty my club with your blood. But if ever you interfere with\nme or my mate or the old one, it will go hard with you.\"\n\nLuk-no crept away, while amazement gripped the tribe. And in the eyes\nof the men and women Rog read complete victory.\n\nJohann Adam shook his wise old head, realizing what had happened. \"I\nhave known men far more cultured than you to seize the opportunity you\nspurned,\" he murmured. \"Perhaps with such a start, civilization will\ncome to a better end, this time!\"\n",
