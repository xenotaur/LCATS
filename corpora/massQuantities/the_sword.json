Just over the bridge, he\npulled the car to the curb and flipped the switch with violence.\n\"Harrison,\" he muttered.\n\n\"How's the water, fella?\" asked the voice of Bob Mills, his assistant.\n\nThere was a beautiful moon over the island. The surf lapped at the tiers\nof the picturesque bridge. Soft music was playing somewhere. There was a\ntinkle of young laughter on the light sea breeze.\n\nHarrison was vacationing and he viewed the emergency contact from\nIntersolar Spaceport with annoyance.\n\n\"What do you want, Bob?\"\n\n\"Sorry, George,\" Bob Mills said more seriously. \"I guess you got to come\nback.\"\n\n\"Listen--\" protested Harrison.\n\n\"Orders, George--orders from upstairs.\"\n\nHarrison took a long look at the pleasant island street stretching out\nbefore him. Sea-corroded street lamps lit the short, island\nthoroughfare. People in light blue jeans, bronzed youths in skipper\ncaps, deep-tanned girls in terry-cloth.\n\n\"What the hell is it?\"\n\n\"Don't know, but it's big. Better hurry.\" He clicked off.\n\nHarrison skidded the car into a squealing turn. Angrily, he raced over\nthe bridge and onto the roaring highway. Thirty minutes later Intersolar\nSpaceport, Los Angeles, blazed ahead of him.\n\nThe main gate guards waved him in immediately and two cycle guards ran\ninterference for him through the scores of video newsmen who lined the\nspaceport street.\n\nBob Mills met him at the entrance to the Administration building.\n\n\"Sorry, George, but--\"\n\n\"Yeah. Oh, sure. Now what the hell is it all about?\"\n\nMills handed him a sheaf of tele-transmittals. They bore heavy secret\nstamps. Harrison looked up quizzically.\n\n\"You saw the video boys,\" Mills said. \"The wheels think there might be\nsome hysteria.\"\n\n\"Any reason for it?\"\n\n\"Not that we know of--not that _I_ know of anyway. The thing is coming\nin awfully fast--speed of light times a factor of at least two, maybe\nfour.\"\n\nHarrison whistled softly and scanned the reports frowning.\n\n\"They contacted us--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"_--in perfect Intersolar Convention code._ Said they were coming in.\nThat's all. The port boys have done all they could to find out what to\nexpect and prepare for it. Somebody thought Engineering might be\nneeded--that's why they sent for you.\"\n\n\"Used Intersolar Convention code, eh,\" mused Harrison.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mills. \"But there's nothing like this thing known in the\nsolar system, nothing even close to this fast. Besides that, there was a\nsighting several days ago that's being studied.\n\n\"One of the radio observatories claims to have received a new signal\nfrom one of the star clusters....\"\n\n\n\nThe huge metal vessel settled to a perfect contact with its assigned\nstrip. It hovered over the geometric center of the long runway and\ntouched without raising a speck of dust.\n\nNot a sound, not a puff of smoke issued from any part of it. Immediately\nit rose a few feet above the concrete and began to move toward the\nparking strip. It moved with the weightless ease of an ancient dirigible\non a still day. It was easily the largest, strangest object ever seen\nbefore at the spaceport.\n\nA team of searchlight men swivelled the large spot atop the tower and\nbathed the ship in orange light.\n\n\"What's that mean?\" asked Mills paging his way through a book.\n\n\"'Halt propulsion equipment,' I think,\" said Harrison.\n\n\"It's a good thing the code makers were vague about that,\" smiled Mills.\n\"It's a good thing they didn't say jets or rockets--'cause this thing\nhasn't got any.\"\n\n\"_Attention!_\"\n\nThat single word suddenly issued from the alien ship.\n\n\"_The Races of Wan greet you._\"\n\nIt might have been the voice of a frog. It was low, gutteral, entirely\nalien, entirely without either enthusiasm or trace of human emotion.\n\n\"Jesus!\" muttered Mills.\n\nScores of video teams focused equipment on the gleaming alien.\n\n\"_The Races of Wan desire contact with you._\"\n\n\"In English yet!\" amazed Mills.\n\n\"The basis of this contact together with its nature are dependent upon\n_you_!\"\n\nThe voice had become ugly. There was nothing human about it save only\nthe words, which were in flawless English.\n\n\"Your system has long been under surveillance by the Races of Wan.\nYour--progress has been noted.\"\n\nThere was almost a note of contempt, thought Harrison, in the last\nsentence.\n\n\"Your system is about to reach others. It therefore becomes a matter of\nurgency that the Races of Wan make contact.\n\n\"Your cultural grasp is as yet quite small. You reach four of your own\nsystem's planets. You have attempted--with little success--colonization.\nYou anticipate further penetrations.\n\n\"You master the physical conditions of your system with difficulty. You\nare a victim of many of the natural laws--natural laws which you dimly\nperceive.\n\n\"But you master yourselves with greatest difficulty, and you are\ninfinitely more a victim of forces within your very nature--_forces\nwhich you know almost not at all_.\"\n\n\"What the hell--\" began Mills.\n\n\"Because of this disparity your maturity as a race is much in doubt.\nThere are many among the cultures of the stars who would consider your\nrace deviant and deadly. There are a very few who would welcome you to\nthe reaches of space.\n\n\"But most desire more information. Thus our visit. We have come to\ngather data that will determine your--disposition--\n\n\"Your race accepts the principle of extermination. You relentlessly seek\nand kill for commercial or political advantage. You live in mistrust and\nenvy and threat. Yet, as earthlings, you have power. It is not great,\nbut it contains a threat. We wish now to know the extent of that threat.\n\n\"Here is the test.\"\n\nSuddenly an image resolved itself on the gleaming metal of the ship\nitself.\n\n_It was a blueprint._\n\nA hundred cameras focused on it.\n\n\"_Construct this. It is defective. Correct that which renders it not\nuseful. We shall return in three days for your solution._\"\n\n\"Good God!\" exclaimed Harrison. \"It's a--_sword_!\"\n\n\"A what?\" asked Mills.\n\n\"A sword--people used to chop each other's heads off with them.\"\n\nAlmost at once the metal giant was seen to move. Quickly it retraced its\npath across the apron, remained poised on the center of the runway, then\ndisappeared almost instantaneously.\n\n\n\nThe Intersolar Council weathered the storm. The representative of the\ncolony on Venus was recalled, his political life temporarily ended. A\nvigilante committee did for a time picket the spaceport. But the\ntremendous emotional outbursts of the first day gradually gave way to a\nsemblance of order.\n\nVideo speakers, some of them with huge followings, still denounced the\nISC for permitting the alien to land in the first place. Others clamored\nfor a fleet to pursue the arrogant visitor. And there were many fools\nwho chose to ignore the implications of the strange speech and its\nimplied threat. Some even thought it was a gigantic hoax.\n\nBut most men soon came to restore their trust in the scientists of the\nIntersolar Council.\n\nHarrison cast down the long sheet of morning news that had rolled out of\nthe machine.\n\n\"The fools! They'll play politics right up to the last, won't they?\"\n\n\"What else?\" asked Mills. \"Playing politics is as good a way as any of\navoiding what you can't figure out or solve.\"\n\n\"And yet, what the hell are _we_ doing here?\" Harrison mused. \"Listen to\nthis.\"\n\nHe picked up a stapled sheaf of papers from his desk.\n\n\"'_Analysis of word usage indicates a complete knowledge of the English\nlanguage_'--that's brilliant, isn't it? '_The ideational content and\ngeneral semantic tone of the alien speech indicates a relatively high\nintelligence._\n\n\"'_Usage is current, precise...._' Bob, the man who wrote that report is\none of the finest semantics experts in the solar system. He's the brain\nthat finally broke that ancient Martian ceremonial language they found\non the columns.\"\n\n\"Well, mastermind,\" said Mills. \"What will the _Engineering_ report say\nwhen you get around to writing it?\"\n\n\"Engineering report? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"You didn't read the memo on your desk then? The one that requested a\npreliminary report from every department by 2200 today.\"\n\n\"Good God, no,\" said Harrison snapping up the thin yellow sheet. \"What\nin hell has a sword got to do with Engineering?\"\n\n\"What's it got to do with Semantics?\" mocked Robert Mills.\n\n\n\n_Construct this. It is defective. Correct that which renders it not\nuseful._\n\nHarrison's eyes burned. He would have to quit pretty soon and dictate\nthe report. There wasn't any use in trying to go beyond a certain point.\nYou got so damned tired you couldn't think straight. You might as well\ngo to bed and rest. Bob Mills had gone long before.\n\nHe poured over the blueprint again, striving to concentrate. Why in hell\nhad he not given up altogether? What possible contribution could an\nengineer make toward the solution of such a problem?\n\n_Construct this._\n\nYou simply made the thing according to a simple blueprint. You tried out\nwhat you got, found out what it was good for, found out then what was\nkeeping it from doing that. You fixed it.\n\nWell, the sword had been constructed. Fantastic effort had been directed\ninto producing a perfect model of the print. Every minute convolution\nhad been followed to an incredible point of perfection. Harrison was\nwilling to bet there was less than a ten thousandths error--even in the\nhandle, where the curves seemed to be more artistic than mechanical.\n\n_It is defective._\n\nWhat was defective about it? Nobody had actually tried the ancient\nweapon, it was true. You didn't go around chopping people's heads off.\nBut experts on such things had examined the twelve-pound blade and had\npronounced it \"well balanced\"--whatever that meant. It would crack a\nskull, sever arteries, kill or maim.\n\n_Correct...._\n\nWhat was there to correct? Could you make it maim or kill better? Could\nyou sharpen it so that it would go through thick clothing or fur? Yes.\nCould you make it a bit heavier so that it might slice a metal shield?\nYes, perhaps. All of these things had been half-heartedly suggested. But\nnobody had yet proposed any kind of qualitative change or been able to\nsuggest any kind of change that would meet the next admonition of the\nalien:\n\nCorrect _that which renders it not useful_.\n\nWhat actually could be done to a weapon to make it useful? Matter of\nfact, what was there about the present weapon that made it _not_ useful.\nApparently it was useful as hell--useful enough to cut a man's throat,\npierce his heart, slice an arm off him....\n\nWhat were the possible swords; what was the morphology of _concept\nsword_?\n\nHarrison picked up a dog-eared report.\n\nThere was the _rapier_, a thin, light, extremely flexible kind of sword\n(if you considered the word \"sword\" generic, as the Semantics expert had\npointed out). It was good for duels, man-to-man combat, usually on what\nthe ancients had called the \"field of honor.\"\n\nThere were all kinds of short swords, dirks, shivs, stilettos, daggers.\nThey were the weapons of stealth men--and sometimes women--used in the\nnight. The assassin's weapon, the glitter in the darkened alley.\n\nThere were the _machetes_. Jungle knives, cane-cutting instruments. The\nbayonets....\n\nYou could go on and on from there, apparently. But what did you get?\nThey were all more or less useful, Harrison supposed. There was nothing\nmore you could do with any kind of sword that was designed for a\nspecific purpose.\n\nHarrison sighed in despair. He had expected vastly more when he had\nfirst heard the alien mention \"test\". He had expected some complex\ninstrument, something new to Terra and her colonies. Something involving\ncomplex and perhaps unknown principles of an alien technology. Something\nappropriate to the strange metal craft that traveled so very fast.\n\nOr perhaps a paradox. A thing that could not be constructed without\nexploding, like a lattice of U235 of exactly critical size. Or an\ninstrument that must be assembled in an impossible sequence, like a\nclock with a complete, single-pieced outer shell. Or a part of a thing\nthat could be \"corrected\" only if the whole thing were visualized,\nconstructed, and tested.\n\nNo, the blueprint he held now involved an awareness that must prove\nbeyond mere technology, or at least Terran technology. Maybe it involved\nan awareness that transcended Terran philosophy as well.\n\nHarrison slapped the pencil down on his desk, rose, put his coat on, and\nleft the office.\n\n\n\n\"... we are guilty as the angels of the bible were guilty. Pride! That's\nit, folks, pride. False pride....\"\n\nHarrison fringed the intent crowd of people cursing when, frequently,\nsomeone carelessly bumped into him in an effort to get nearer the\nsidewalk preacher.\n\n\"We tried to live with the angels above. We wanted to fly like the\nbirds. And then we wanted to fly like the angels....\"\n\nSomeone near Harrison muttered an \"Amen\". Harrison wove his way through\nthem wondering where the hundreds of such evangelists had come from so\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Ya know, folks, the angels themselves got uppity once. _They_ wanted to\nbe like Gawd himself, they did. Now, it's us.\"\n\nThere was a small flutter of laughter among the crowd. It was very\nquickly suppressed--so quickly that Harrison gained a new appreciation\nof the tenor of the crowd.\n\n\"That's right, laugh! Laugh at our folly!\" continued the thin-faced,\nbright-eyed man. \"It was a sword that the angel used to kick Adam and\nEve out of the garden. The sword figures all through the bible, folks.\nYou ought to read the bible. You ought to get to know it. It's all\nthere. All there for you to read....\"\n\n_By Christ_, thought Harrison. Here was an aspect of the concept, sword,\nhe had not considered. Morphological thinking required that _all_\naspects of a concept be explored, all plotted against all others for\npossible correlation....\n\nNo. That was silly. The bible was a beautiful piece of literature and\nsome people believed it inspired. But the great good men who wrote the\nbible had little scientific knowledge of a sword. They would simply\ndescribe the weapon as a modern fiction writer would describe a\nblaster--without knowing any more about one than that it existed and was\na weapon.\n\nSurely the ISC's weapons expert could be trusted to know his swords.\n\n\n\n\"Go on home,\" Mills pleaded. \"You're shot and you know it. You said\nyourself this isn't our show.\"\n\n\"You go home, Bob. I'm all right.\"\n\n\"George ... you're acting strange. Strange as hell.\"\n\n\"I'm all right. Leave me alone,\" snapped Harrison becoming irritable.\n\nMills watched silently as the haggard man slipped a tablet into his\nmouth.\n\n\"It's all right, Bob,\" smiled Harrison weakly. \"I know how to use\nBenzedrine.\"\n\n\"You damn fool, you'll wreck yourself....\"\n\nBut the engineer ignored him. He continued paging his way through the\nbook--the bible, no less. George Harrison and the bible!\n\n\n\nMills was awakened by the telephone. Reaching in the dark for it he\nanswered almost without reaching consciousness.\n\nIt was Harrison.\n\n\"Bob, listen to me. If an angel were to look at us right now, what would\nhe think?\"\n\n\"For God's sake!\" Mills cried into the instrument. \"What's up? You still\nat the office?\"\n\n\"Yeah, answer the question.\"\n\n\"Hold on, George. I'll be down and get you. What you been drinking?\"\n\n\"Bob, would he--she--think much of us? Would the angel figure we\nwere....\"\n\n\"How the hell would _I_ know?\"\n\n\"No, Bob, what you should have asked is 'how the hell would _he_ know.'\"\n\n\n\nIn a daze Mills heard the click as the other hung up.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Harrison, your assistant is looking for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, Kirk. But will you do it?\"\n\n\"Mr. Harrison, we only got one of them. If we screw it up it'll take\ntime to make another and today's the day, you know.\"\n\n\"I'll take the blame.\"\n\n\"Mr. Harrison, you look kind of funny. Hadn't I better....\"\n\nHarrison was sketching a drawing on a piece of waste paper. He was\nworking in quick rough strokes, copying something from a book.\n\n\"They'll blame us both, Mr. Harrison. Anyway, it might hold up somebody\nwho's got a real idea....\"\n\n\"_I_ have a real idea, Kirk. I'm going to draw it for you.\"\n\nThe metal worker noticed that the book Harrison was copying from was a\ndictionary, a very old and battered one.\n\n\"Here, can you follow what I've drawn?\"\n\nThe metal worker accepted it reluctantly, giving Harrison an odd, almost\npatronizing look. \"This is crazy.\"\n\n\"Kirk!\"\n\n\"Look, Mr. Harrison. We worked a long time together. You....\"\n\nHarrison suddenly rose from the chair.\n\n\"This is our one chance of beating this thing, no matter how crazy it\nseems. Will you do the job?\"\n\n\"You believe you got something, eh,\" the other said. \"You think you\nhave?\"\n\n\"I have to have.\"\n\n\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the President of the Intersolar Council. \"There is\nvery little to say. There can be no denying the fact that we have\nexhausted our efforts at finding a satisfactory solution.\n\n\"The contents of this book of reports represents the greatest\nconcentration of expert reasoning perhaps ever applied to a single\nproblem.\n\n\"But alas, the problem remains--unsolved.\"\n\nHe paused to glance at his wristwatch.\n\n\"The aliens return in an hour. As you very well know there is one action\nthat remains for us. It is one we have held to this hour. It is one that\nhas always been present and one that we have been constantly urged to\nuse.\n\n\"Force, gentlemen. It is not insignificant. It lies at our command. It\nrepresents the technology of the Intersolar alliance. I will entertain a\nmotion to use it.\"\n\nThere were no nay votes.\n\n\n\nThe alien arrived on schedule. The ship grew from a tiny bright speck in\nthe sky to full size. It settled to a graceful landing as before on the\nstrip and silently moved into the revetment.\n\nAgain it spoke in the voice of the frog, but the tone was, if anything,\nless human this time.\n\n\"Earthmen, we have come for your solution.\"\n\nAt that instant a hundred gun crews stiffened and waited for a signal\nbehind their carefully camouflaged blast plates and inside dummy\nbuildings....\n\nHarrison was running. The Administration building was empty. His\nfootsteps echoed through the long, silent halls. He headed for an\nemergency exit that led directly to the blast tunnel. All doors were\nlocked.\n\nThe only way was over the wall. He paused and tossed the awkward, heavy\nobject over the ten-foot wall. Then, backing toward the building, he ran\nand jumped for a hold onto the wall's edge. He failed by several inches\nto reach it.\n\n\"Earthmen, we have come for your solution.\"\n\nHe ran at the wall once more. This time he caught a fair hold with one\nhand. Digging at the rough concrete with his feet he was able to secure\nthe hold and begin pulling his body upward.\n\nQuickly he was over the wall and onto the apron, a hundred yards from\nthe shining metal ship.\n\n\"Wait!\" he shouted. \"Wait, for God's sake!\"\n\nPicking up the object he had tossed over the wall, he raised it above\nhis head and ran toward the alien ship.\n\n\"Wait! Here is the solution,\" he gasped.\n\nSomehow the command to fire was not given. There was a long moment of\ncomplete silence on the field. Nothing moved.\n\nThen the voice of the frog boomed from the alien ship.\n\n\"The solution appears to be correct.\"\n\n\n\nThe alien left three days later. Regular communications would begin\nwithin the week. Future meetings would work out technical difficulties.\nPreliminary trade agreements, adequately safeguarded, were drafted and\ntransmitted to the ship. The Races of Man and the Races of Wan were in\nharmony.\n\n\n\n\"It was simply too obvious for any of us to notice,\" explained Harrison.\n\"It took that street-corner evangelist to jar something loose--even then\nit was an accident.\"\n\n\"And the rest of us--\" started Mills.\n\n\"While _all_ of us worked on the assumption that the test involved a\nshowing of strength--a flexing of technological muscle.\"\n\n\"I still don't see--\"\n\n\"Well, the evangelist put the problem on the right basis. He humbled us,\nexalted the aliens--that is, he thought the alien was somehow a\nmessenger from God to put us in our places.\"\n\n\"We were pretty humble ourselves, especially the last day,\" protested\nMills.\n\n\"But humble about our _technology_,\" put in Harrison. \"The aliens must\nbe plenty far beyond us technologically. But how about their cultural\nsuperiority. Ask yourself how a culture that could produce the ship\nwe've just seen could survive without--well destroying itself.\"\n\n\"I still don't understand.\"\n\n\"The aliens developed pretty much equally in _all_ directions. They\ndeveloped force--plenty of it, enough force to kick that big ship\nthrough space at the speed of light plus. They must also have learned to\ncontrol force, to live with it.\"\n\n\"Maybe you better stick to the sword business,\" said Mills.\n\n\"The sword is the crux of the matter. What did the alien say about the\nsword? 'It is defective.' It _is_ defective, Bob. Not as an instrument\nof death. It will kill a man or injure him well enough.\n\n\"But a sword--or any other instrument of force for that matter--is a\nterribly ineffectual tool. It was originally designed to act as a tool\nof social control. Did it--or any subsequent weapon of force--do a good\njob at that?\n\n\"As long as man used swords, or gunpowder, or atom bombs, or hydrogen\nbombs, he was doomed to a fearful anarchy of unsolved problems and\ndreadful immaturity.\n\n\"No, the sword is not useful. To fix it--to 'correct that which renders\nit not useful'--meant to make it something else. Now what in the hell\ndid that mean? What can you do with a sword?\"\n\n\"You mean besides cut a man in two with it,\" said Mills.\n\n\"Yes, what can you do with it besides use it as a weapon? Here our\nstreet-corner friend referred me to the right place: The bible!\n\n\"_They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into\npruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither\nshall they learn war any more._\n\n\"The aliens just wanted to know if we meant what we said.\"\n\n\"Do we?\"\n\n\"We better. It's going to take a hell of a lot more than a silly\nploughshare to convince those babies on that ship. But there's more to\nit than that. The ability of a culture finally to pound all of its\nswords--its intellectual ones as well as its steel ones--into\nploughshares must be some kind of least common denominator for cultures\nthat are headed for the stars.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
