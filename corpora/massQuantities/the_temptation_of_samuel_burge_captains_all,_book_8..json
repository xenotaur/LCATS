    "body": "\nTHE TEMPTATION OF SAMUEL BURGE\n\nMr. Higgs, jeweller, sat in the small parlour behind his shop, gazing\nhungrily at a supper-table which had been laid some time before.  It was\na quarter to ten by the small town clock on the mantelpiece, and the\njeweller rubbing his hands over the fire tried in vain to remember what\netiquette had to say about starting a meal before the arrival of an\nexpected guest.\n\n\"He must be coming by the last train after all, sir,\" said the\nhousekeeper entering the room and glancing at the clock.  \"I suppose\nthese London gentlemen keep such late hours they don't understand us\ncountry folk wanting to get to bed in decent time.  You must be wanting\nyour supper, sir.\"\n\nMr. Higgs sighed.  \"I shall be glad of my supper,\" he said slowly, \"but I\ndare say our friend is hungrier still.  Travelling is hungry work.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he is thinking over his words for the seventh day,\" said the\nhousekeeper solemnly.  \"Forgetting hunger and thirst and all our poor\nearthly feelings in the blessedness of his work.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" assented the other, whose own earthly feelings were\nparticularly strong just at that moment.\n\n\"Brother Simpson used to forget all about meal-times when he stayed\nhere,\" said the housekeeper, clasping her hands.  \"He used to sit by the\nwindow with his eyes half-closed and shake his head at the smell from the\nkitchen and call it flesh-pots of Egypt.  He said that if it wasn't for\nkeeping up his strength for the work, luscious bread and fair water was\nall he wanted.  I expect Brother Burge will be a similar sort of man.\"\n\n\"Brother Clark wrote and told me that he only lives for the work,\" said\nthe jeweller, with another glance at the clock.  \"The chapel at\nClerkenwell is crowded to hear him.  It's a blessed favour and privilege\nto have such a selected instrument staying in the house.  I'm curious to\nsee him; from what Brother Clark said I rather fancy that he was a little\nbit wild in his younger days.\"\n\n\"Hallelujah!\" exclaimed the housekeeper with fervour.  \"I mean to think\nas he's seen the error of his ways,\" she added sharply, as her master\nlooked up.\n\n\"There he is,\" said the latter, as the bell rang.\n\nThe housekeeper went to the side-door, and drawing back the bolt admitted\nthe gentleman whose preaching had done so much for the small but select\nsect known as the Seventh Day Primitive Apostles.  She came back into the\nroom followed by a tall stout man, whose upper lip and short stubby beard\nstreaked with grey seemed a poor match for the beady eyes which lurked\nbehind a pair of clumsy spectacles.\n\n\"Brother Samuel Burge?\" inquired the jeweller, rising.\n\nThe visitor nodded, and regarding him with a smile charged with fraternal\nlove, took his hand in a huge grip and shook it fervently.\n\n\"I am glad to see you, Brother Higgs,\" he said, regarding him fondly.\n\"Oh, 'ow my eyes have yearned to be set upon you!  Oh, 'ow my ears 'ave\nlonged to hearken unto the words of your voice!\"\n\nHe breathed thickly, and taking a seat sat with his hands upon his knees,\nlooking at a fine piece of cold beef which the housekeeper had just\nplaced upon the table.\n\n\"Is Brother Clark well?\" inquired the jeweller, placing a chair for him\nat the table and taking up his carving-knife.\n\n\"Dear Brother Clark is in excellent 'ealth, I thank you,\" said the other,\ntaking the proffered chair.  \"Oh! what a man he is; what a instrument for\ngood.  Always stretching out them blessed hands of 'is to make one of the\nfallen a Seventh Day Primitive.\"\n\n\"And success attends his efforts?\" said the jeweller.\n\n\"Success, Brother!\" repeated Mr. Burge, eating rapidly and gesticulating\nwith his knife.  \"Success ain't no name for it.  Why, since this day last\nweek he has saved three pick-pockets, two Salvationists, one bigamist and\na Roman Catholic.\"\n\nBrother Higgs murmured his admiration.  \"You are also a power for good,\"\nhe said wistfully.  \"Brother Clark tells me in his letter that your\nexhortations have been abundantly blessed.\"\n\nMr. Burge shook his head.  \"A lot of it falls by the wayside,\" he said\nmodestly, \"but some of it is an eye-opener to them as don't entirely shut\ntheir ears.  Only the day before yesterday I 'ad two jemmies and a dark\nlantern sent me with a letter saying as 'ow the owner had no further use\nfor 'em.\"\n\nThe jeweller's eyes glistened with admiration not quite untinged with\nenvy.  \"Have you expounded the Word for long?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Six months,\" replied the other.  \"It come to me quite natural--I was on\nthe penitent bench on the Saturday, and the Wednesday afterwards I\npreached as good a sermon as ever I've preached in my life.  Brother\nClark said it took 'is breath away.\"\n\n\"And he's a judge too,\" said the admiring jeweller.\n\n\"Now,\" continued Brother Burge, helping himself plentifully to pickled\nwalnuts.  \"Now there ain't standing room in our Bethel when I'm\nexpounding.  People come to hear me from all parts--old and young--rich\nand poor--and the Apostles that don't come early 'ave to stand outside\nand catch the crumbs I throw 'em through the winders.\"\n\n\"It is enough,\" sighed Brother Higgs, whose own audience was frequently\ncontent to be on the wrong side of the window, \"it is enough to make a\nman vain.\"\n\n\"I struggle against it, Brother,\" said Mr. Burge, passing his cup up for\nsome more tea.  \"I fight against it hard, but once the Evil One was\nalmost too much for me; and in spite of myself, and knowing besides that\nit was a plot of 'is, I nearly felt uplifted.\"\n\nBrother Higgs, passing him some more beef, pressed for details.\n\n\"He sent me two policemen,\" replied the other, scowling darkly at the\nmeanness of the trick.  \"One I might 'ave stood, but two come to being\npretty near too much for me.  They sat under me while I gave 'em the Word\n'ot and strong, and the feeling I had standing up there and telling\npolicemen what they ought to do I shall never forget.\"\n\n\"But why should policemen make you proud?\" asked his puzzled listener.\n\nMr. Burge looked puzzled in his turn.  \"Why, hasn't Brother Clark told\nyou about me?\" he inquired.\n\nMr. Higgs shook his head.  \"He sort of--suggested that--that you had been\na little bit wild before you came to us,\" he murmured apologetically.\n\n\"A--little--bit--wild?\" repeated Brother Burge, in horrified accents.\n\"ME? a little bit wild?\"\n\n\"No doubt he exaggerated a little,\" said the jeweller hurriedly.  \"Being\nsuch a good man himself, no doubt things would seem wild to him that\nwouldn't to us--to me, I mean.\"\n\n\"A little bit wild,\" said his visitor again.  \"Sam Burge, the Converted\nBurglar, a little bit wild.  Well, well!\"\n\n\"Converted what?\" shouted the jeweller, half-rising from his chair.\n\n\"Burglar,\" said the other shortly.  \"Why, I should think I know more\nabout the inside o' gaols than anybody in England; I've pretty near\nkilled three policemen, besides breaking a gent's leg and throwing a\nfootman out of window, and then Brother Clark goes and says I've been a\nlittle bit wild.  I wonder what he would 'ave?\"\n\n\"But you--you've quite reformed now?\" said the jeweller, resuming his\nseat and making a great effort to hide his consternation.\n\n\"I 'ope so,\" said Mr. Burge, with alarming humility; \"but it's an\nuncertain world, and far be it from me to boast.  That's why I've come\nhere.\"\n\nMr. Higgs, only half-comprehending, sat back gasping.\n\n\"If I can stand this,\" pursued Brother Burge, gesticulating wildly in the\ndirection of the shop, \"if I can stand being here with all these 'ere\npretty little things to be 'ad for the trouble of picking of 'em up, I\ncan stand anything.  Tempt me, I says to Brother Clark.  Put me in the\nway o' temptation, I says.  Let me see whether the Evil One or me is the\nstrongest; let me 'ave a good old up and down with the Powers o'\nDarkness, and see who wins.\"\n\nMr. Higgs, gripping the edge of the table with both hands, gazed at this\nnew Michael in speechless consternation.\n\n\"I think I see his face now,\" said Brother Burge, with tender enthusiasm.\n\"All in a glow it was, and he patted me on the shoulder and says, 'I'll\nsend you on a week's mission to Duncombe,' he says, and 'you shall stop\nwith Brother Higgs who 'as a shop full o' cunning wrought vanities in\nsilver and gold.'\"\n\n\"But suppose,\" said the jeweller, finding his voice by a great effort,\n\"suppose victory is not given unto you.\"\n\n\"It won't make any difference,\" replied his visitor.  \"Brother Clark\npromised that it shouldn't.  'If you fall, Brother,' he says, 'we'll help\nyou up again.  When you are tired of sin come back to us--there's always\na welcome.'\"\n\n\"But--\" began the dismayed jeweller.\n\n\"We can only do our best,\" said Brother Burge, \"the rest we must leave.\nI 'ave girded my loins for the fray, and taken much spiritual sustenance\non the way down from this little hymn-book.\"\n\nMr. Higgs paid no heed.  He sat marvelling over the fatuousness of\nBrother Clark and trying to think of ways and means out of the dilemma\ninto which that gentleman's perverted enthusiasm had placed him.  He\nwondered whether it would be possible to induce Brother Burge to sleep\nelsewhere by offering to bear his hotel expenses, and at last, after some\nhesitation, broached the subject.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the other, pushing his plate from him and regarding him\nwith great severity.  \"Go and sleep at a hotel?  After Brother Clark has\nbeen and took all this trouble?  Why, I wouldn't think of doing such a\nthing.\"\n\n\"Brother Clark has no right to expose you to such a trial,\" said Mr.\nHiggs with great warmth.\n\n\"I wonder what he'd say if he 'eard you,\" remarked Mr. Burge sternly.\n\"After his going and making all these arrangements, for you to try and go\nand upset 'em.  To ask me to shun the fight like a coward; to ask me to\ngo and hide in the rear-ranks in a hotel with everything locked up, or a\nCoffer Pallis with nothing to steal.\"\n\n\"I should sleep far more comfortably if I knew that you were not\nundergoing this tremendous strain,\" said the unhappy Mr. Higgs, \"and\nbesides that, if you did give way, it would be a serious business for me\n--that's what I want you to look at.  I am afraid that if--if unhappily\nyou did fall, I couldn't prevent you.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you couldn't,\" said the other cordially.  \"That's the beauty of\nit; that's when the Evil One's whispers get louder and louder.  Why, I\ncould choke you between my finger and thumb.  If unfortunately my fallen\nnature should be too strong for me, don't interfere whatever you do.  I\nmightn't be myself.\"\n\nMr. Higgs rose and faced him gasping.\n\n\"Not even--call for--the police--I suppose,\" he jerked out.\n\n\"That would be interfering,\" said Brother Burge coldly.\n\nThe jeweller tried to think.  It was past eleven.  The housekeeper had\ngone to spend the night with an ailing sister, and a furtive glance at\nBrother Burge's small shifty eyes and fat unwholesome face was sufficient\nto deter him from leaving him alone with his property, while he went to\nask the police to give an eye to his house for the night.  Besides, it\nwas more than probable that Mr. Burge would decline to allow such a\nproceeding.  With a growing sense of his peril he resolved to try\nflattery.\n\n\"It was a great thing for the Brethren to secure a man like you,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"I never thought they'd ha' done it,\" said Mr. Burge frankly.  \"I've 'ad\nall sorts trying to convert me; crying over me and praying over me.  I\nremember the first dear good man that called me a lorst lamb.  He didn't\nsay anything else for a month.\"\n\n\"So upset,\" hazarded the jeweller.\n\n\"I broke his jor, pore feller,\" said Brother Burge, a sad but withal\nindulgent smile lighting up his face at the vagaries of his former\ncareer.  \"What time do you go to bed, Brother?\"\n\n\"Any time,\" said the other reluctantly.  \"I suppose you are tired with\nyour journey?\"\n\nMr. Burge assented, and rising from his chair yawned loudly and stretched\nhimself.  In the small room with his huge arms raised he looked colossal.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said the jeweller, still seeking to re-assure himself, \"I\nsuppose dear Brother Clark felt pretty certain of you, else he wouldn't\nhave sent you here?\"\n\n\"Brother Clark said 'What is a jeweller's shop compared with a 'uman\nsoul, a priceless 'uman soul?'\" replied Mr. Burge.  \"What is a few\ngew-gaws to decorate them that perish, and make them vain, when you come\nto consider the opportunity of such a trial, and the good it'll do and\nthe draw it'll be--if I do win--and testify to the congregation to that\neffect?  Why, there's sermons for a lifetime in it.\"\n\n\"So there is,\" said the jeweller, trying to look cheerful.  \"You've got a\ngood face, Brother Burge, and you'll do a lot of good by your preaching.\nThere is honesty written in every feature.\"\n\nMr. Burge turned and surveyed himself in the small pier-glass.  \"Yes,\" he\nsaid, somewhat discontentedly, \"I don't look enough like a burglar to\nsuit some of 'em.\"\n\n\"Some people are hard to please,\" said the other warmly.\n\nMr. Burge started and eyed him thoughtfully, and then as Mr. Higgs after\nsome hesitation walked into the shop to turn the gas out, stood in the\ndoorway watching him.  A smothered sigh as he glanced round the shop bore\nwitness to the state of his feelings.\n\nThe jeweller hesitated again in the parlour, and then handing Brother\nBurge his candle turned out the gas, and led the way slowly upstairs to\nthe room which had been prepared for the honoured visitor.  He shook\nhands at the door and bade him an effusive good-night, his voice\ntrembling despite himself as he expressed a hope that Mr. Burge would\nsleep well.  He added casually that he himself was a very light sleeper.\n\nTo-night sleep of any kind was impossible.  He had given up the front\nroom to his guest, and his own window looked out on an over-grown garden.\nHe sat trying to read, with his ears alert for the slightest sound.\nBrother Burge seemed to be a long time undressing.  For half an hour\nafter he had retired he could hear him moving restlessly about his room.\n\nTwelve o'clock struck from the tower of the parish church, and was\nfollowed almost directly by the tall clock standing in the hall\ndown-stairs.  Scarcely had the sounds died away than a low moaning from\nthe next room caused the affrighted jeweller to start from his chair and\nplace his ear against the wall.  Two or three hollow groans came through\nthe plaster, followed by ejaculations which showed clearly that Brother\nBurge was at that moment engaged in a terrified combat with the Powers\nof Darkness to decide whether he should, or should not, rifle his host's\nshop.  His hands clenched and his ear pressed close to the wall, the\njeweller listened to a monologue which increased in interest with every\nword.\n\n\"I tell you I won't,\" said the voice in the next room with a groan, \"I\nwon't.  Get thee behind me--Get thee--No, and don't shove me over to the\ndoor; if you can't get behind me without doing that, stay where you are.\nYes, I know it's a fortune as well as what you do; but it ain't mine.\"\n\nThe listener caught his breath painfully.\n\n\"Diamond rings,\" continued Brother Burge in a suffocating voice.  \"Stop\nit, I tell you.  No, I won't just go and look at 'em.\"\n\nA series of groans which the jeweller noticed to his horror got weaker\nand weaker testified to the greatness of the temptation.  He heard\nBrother Burge rise, and then a succession of panting snarls seemed to\nindicate a fierce bodily encounter.\n\n\"I don't--want to look at 'em,\" said Brother Burge in an exhausted voice.\n\"What's--the good of--looking at 'em?  It's like you, you know diamonds\nare my weakness.  What does it matter if he is asleep?  What's my knife\ngot to do with you?\"\n\nBrother Higgs reeled back and a mist passed before his eyes.  He came to\nhimself at the sound of a door opening, and impelled with a vague idea of\ndefending his property, snatched up his candle and looked out on to the\nlanding.\n\nThe light fell on Brother Burge, fully dressed and holding his boots in\nhis hand.  For a moment they gazed at each other in silence; then the\njeweller found his voice.\n\n\"I thought you were ill, Brother,\" he faltered.\n\nAn ugly scowl lit up the other's features.  \"Don't you tell me any of\nyour lies,\" he said fiercely.  \"You're watching me; that's what you're\ndoing.  Spying on me.\"\n\n\"I thought that you were being tempted,\" confessed the trembling Mr.\nHiggs.\n\nAn expression of satisfaction which he strove to suppress appeared on Mr.\nBurge's face.\n\n\"So I was,\" he said sternly.  \"So I was; but that's my business.  I don't\nwant your assistance; I can fight my own battles.  You go to bed--I'm\ngoing to tell the congregation I won the fight single-'anded.\"\n\n\"So you have, Brother,\" said the other eagerly; \"but it's doing me good\nto see it.  It's a lesson to me; a lesson to all of us the way you\nwrestled.\"\n\n\"I thought you was asleep,\" growled Brother Burge, turning back to his\nroom and speaking over his shoulder.  \"You get back to bed; the fight\nain't half over yet.  Get back to bed and keep quiet.\"\n\nThe door closed behind him, and Mr. Higgs, still trembling, regained his\nroom and looked in agony at the clock.  It was only half-past twelve and\nthe sun did not rise until six.  He sat and shivered until a second\ninstalment of groans in the next room brought him in desperation to his\nfeet.\n\nBrother Burge was in the toils again, and the jeweller despite his fears\ncould not help realizing what a sensation the story of his temptation\nwould create.  Brother Burge was now going round and round his room like\nan animal in a cage, and sounds as of a soul wrought almost beyond\nendurance smote upon the listener's quivering ear.  Then there was a long\nsilence more alarming even than the noise of the conflict.  Had Brother\nBurge won, and was he now sleeping the sleep of the righteous, or----\nMr. Higgs shivered and put his other ear to the wall.  Then he heard his\nguest move stealthily across the floor; the boards creaked and the handle\nof the door turned.\n\nMr. Higgs started, and with a sudden flash of courage born of anger and\ndesperation seized a small brass poker from the fire-place, and taking\nthe candle in his other hand went out on to the landing again.  Brother\nBurge was closing his door softly, and his face when he turned it upon\nthe jeweller was terrible in its wrath.  His small eyes snapped with\nfury, and his huge hands opened and shut convulsively.\n\n\"What, agin!\" he said in a low growl.  \"After all I told you!\"\n\nMr. Higgs backed slowly as he advanced.\n\n\"No noise,\" said Mr. Burge in a dreadful whisper.  \"One scream and I'll--\nWhat were you going to do with that poker?\"\n\nHe took a stealthy step forward.\n\n\"I--I,\" began the jeweller.  His voice failed him.  \"Burglars,\" he\nmouthed, \"downstairs.\"\n\n\"What?\" said the other, pausing.\n\nMr. Higgs threw truth to the winds. \"I heard them in the shop,\" he said,\nrecovering, \"that's why I took up the poker.  Can't you hear them?\"\n\nMr. Burge listened for the fraction of a second.  \"Nonsense,\" he said\nhuskily.\n\n\"I heard them talking,\" said the other recklessly.  \"Let's go down and\ncall the police.\"\n\n\"Call 'em from the winder,\" said Brother Burge, backing with some haste,\n\"they might 'ave pistols or something, and they're ugly customers when\nthey're disturbed.\"\n\nHe stood with strained face listening.\n\n\"Here they come,\" whispered the jeweller with a sudden movement of alarm.\n\nBrother Burge turned, and bolting into his room clapped the door to and\nlocked it.  The jeweller stood dumbfounded on the landing; then he heard\nthe window go up and the voice of Brother Burge, much strengthened by the\nreligious exercises of the past six months, bellowing lustily for the\npolice.\n\nFor a few seconds Mr. Higgs stood listening and wondering what\nexplanation he should give.  Still thinking, he ran downstairs, and,\nthrowing open the pantry window, unlocked the door leading into the shop\nand scattered a few of his cherished possessions about the floor.  By the\ntime he had done this, people were already beating upon the street-door\nand exchanging hurried remarks with Mr. Burge at the window above.  The\njeweller shot back the bolts, and half-a-dozen neighbours, headed by the\nbutcher opposite, clad in his nightgown and armed with a cleaver, burst\ninto the passage.  A constable came running up just as the pallid face of\nBrother Burge peered over the balusters.  The constable went upstairs\nthree at a time, and twisting his hand in the ex-burglar's neck-cloth\nbore him backwards.\n\n\"I've got one,\" he shouted.  \"Come up and hold him while I look round.\"\n\nThe butcher was beside him in a moment; Brother Burge struggling wildly,\ncalled loudly upon the name of Brother Higgs.\n\n\"That's all right, constable,\" said the latter, \"that's a friend of\nmine.\"\n\n\"Friend o' yours, sir?\" said the disappointed officer, still holding him.\n\nThe jeweller nodded.  \"Mr. Samuel Burge the Converted Burglar,\" he said\nmechanically.\n\n\"Conver----\" gasped the astonished constable.  \"Converted burglar?\nHere!\"\n\n\"He is a preacher now,\" added Mr. Higgs.\n\n\"Preacher?\" retorted the constable.  \"Why it's as plain as a pikestaff.\nConfederates: his part was to go down and let 'em in.\"\n\nMr. Burge raised a piteous outcry.  \"I hope you may be forgiven for them\nwords,\" he cried piously.\n\n\"What time did you go up to bed?\" pursued the constable.\n\n\"About half-past eleven,\" replied Mr. Higgs.\n\nThe other grunted with satisfaction.  \"And he's fully dressed, with his\nboots off,\" he remarked.  \"Did you hear him go out of his room at all?\"\n\n\"He did go out,\" said the jeweller truth-fully, \"but----\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" said the constable, turning to his prisoner with\naffectionate solicitude.  \"Now you come along o' me.  Come quietly,\nbecause it'll be the best for you in the end.\"\n\n\"You won't get your skull split open then,\" added the butcher, toying\nwith his cleaver.\n\nThe jeweller hesitated.  He had no desire to be left alone with Mr. Burge\nagain; and a sense of humour, which many years' association with the\nPrimitive Apostles had not quite eradicated, strove for hearing.\n\n\"Think of the sermon it'll make,\" he said encouragingly to the frantic\nMr. Burge, \"think of the congregation!\"\n\nBrother Burge replied in language which he had not used in public since\nhe had joined the Apostles.  The butcher and another man stood guard over\nhim while the constable searched the premises and made all secure again.\nThen with a final appeal to Mr. Higgs who was keeping in the background,\nhe was pitched to the police-station by the energetic constable and five\nzealous assistants.\n\nA diffidence, natural in the circumstances, prevented him from narrating\nthe story of his temptation to the magistrates next morning, and Mr.\nHiggs was equally reticent.  He was put back while the police\ncommunicated with London, and in the meantime Brother Clark and a band\nof Apostles flanked down to his support.\n\nOn his second appearance before the magistrates he was confronted with\nhis past; and his past to the great astonishment of the Brethren being\nfree from all blemish with the solitary exception of fourteen days for\nstealing milk-cans, he was discharged with a caution.  The disillusioned\nPrimitive Apostles also gave him his freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
