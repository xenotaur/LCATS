    "body": "\nNEARLY TWO hundred years of habit carried the chairman of Exodus\nCorporation through the morning ritual of crossing the executive floor.\nGiles made the expected comments, smiled the proper smiles and greeted\nhis staff by the right names, but it was purely automatic. Somehow,\nthinking had grown difficult in the mornings recently.\n\nInside his private office, he dropped all pretense and slumped into the\npadding of his chair, gasping for breath and feeling his heart hammering\nin his chest. He\u2019d been a fool to come to work, he realized. But with\nthe Procyon shuttle arriving yesterday, there was no telling what might\nturn up. Besides, that fool of a medicist had sworn the shot would cure\nany allergy or asthma.\n\nGiles heard his secretary come in, but it wasn\u2019t until the smell of the\ncoffee reached his nose that he looked up. She handed him a filled cup\nand set the carafe down on the age-polished surface of the big desk. She\nwatched solicitously as he drank.\n\n\u201cThat bad, Arthur?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cJust a little tired,\u201d he told her, refilling the cup. She\u2019d made the\ncoffee stronger than usual and it seemed to cut through some of the\nthickness in his head. \u201cI guess I\u2019m getting old, Amanda.\u201d\n\nShe smiled dutifully at the time-worn joke, but he knew she wasn\u2019t\nfooled. She\u2019d cycled to middle age four times in her job and she\nprobably knew him better than he knew himself\u2014which wouldn\u2019t be hard, he\nthought. He\u2019d hardly recognized the stranger in the mirror as he tried\nto shave. His normal thinness had looked almost gaunt and there were\nhollows in his face and circles under his eyes. Even his hair had seemed\nthinner, though that, of course, was impossible.\n\n\u201cAnything urgent on the Procyon shuttle?\u201d he asked as she continue\nstaring at him with worried eyes.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nSHE JERKED her gaze away guiltily and turned to the incoming basket.\n\u201cMostly drugs for experimenting. A personal letter for you, relayed from\nsome place I never heard of. And one of the super-light missiles! They\nfound it drifting half a light-year out and captured it. Jordan\u2019s got a\nreport on it and he\u2019s going crazy. But if you don\u2019t feel well\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all right!\u201d he told her sharply. Then he steadied himself and\nmanaged to smile. \u201cThanks for the coffee, Amanda.\u201d\n\nShe accepted dismissal reluctantly. When she was gone, he sat gazing at\nthe report from Jordan at Research.\n\nFor eighty years now, they\u2019d been sending out the little ships that\nvanished at greater than the speed of light, equipped with every\nconceivable device to make them return automatically after taking\npictures of wherever they arrived. So far, none had ever returned or\nbeen located. This was the first hope they\u2019d found that the century-long\ntrips between stars in the ponderous shuttles might be ended and he\nshould have been filled with excitement at Jordan\u2019s hasty preliminary\nreport.\n\nHe leafed through it. The little ship apparently had been picked up by\naccident when it almost collided with a Sirius-local ship. Scientists\nthere had puzzled over it, reset it and sent it back. The two white rats\non it had still been alive.\n\nGiles dropped the report wearily and picked up the personal message that\nhad come on the shuttle. He fingered the microstrip inside while he\ndrank another coffee, and finally pulled out the microviewer. There were\nthree frames to the message, he saw with some surprise.\n\nHe didn\u2019t need to see the signature on the first projection. Only his\nyoungest son would have sent an elaborate tercentenary greeting\nverse\u2014one that would arrive ninety years too late! Harry had been born\njust before Earth passed the drastic birth limitation act and his mother\nhad spoiled him. He\u2019d even tried to avoid the compulsory emigration\ndraft and stay on with his mother. It had been the bitter quarrels over\nthat which had finally broken Giles\u2019 fifth marriage.\n\nOddly enough, the message in the next frame showed none of that. Harry\nhad nothing but praise for the solar system where he\u2019d been sent. He\nbarely mentioned being married on the way or his dozen children, but\nfilled most of the frame with glowing description and a plea for his\nfather to join him there!\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nGILES SNORTED and turned to the third frame, which showed a group\npicture of the family in some sort of vehicle, against the background of\nan alien but attractive world.\n\nHe had no desire to spend ninety years cooped up with a bunch of callow\nyoung emigrants, even in one of the improved Exodus shuttles. And even\nif Exodus ever got the super-light drive working, there was no reason he\nshould give up his work. The discovery that men could live practically\nforever had put an end to most family ties; sentiment wore thin in half\na century\u2014which wasn\u2019t much time now, though it had once seemed long\nenough.\n\nStrange how the years seemed to get shorter as their number increased.\nThere\u2019d been a song once\u2014something about the years dwindling down. He\ngroped for the lines and couldn\u2019t remember. Drat it! Now he\u2019d probably\nlie awake most of the night again, trying to recall them.\n\nThe outside line buzzed musically, flashing Research\u2019s number. Giles\ngrunted in irritation. He wasn\u2019t ready to face Jordan yet. But he\nshrugged and pressed the button.\n\nThe intense face that looked from the screen was frowning as Jordan\u2019s\neyes seemed to sweep around the room. He was still young\u2014one of the few\nunder a hundred who\u2019d escaped deportation because of special ability\u2014and\npatience was still foreign to him.\n\nThen the frown vanished as an expression of shock replaced it, and Giles\nfelt a sinking sensation. If he looked _that_ bad\u2014\n\nBut Jordan wasn\u2019t looking at him; the man\u2019s interest lay in the\nprojected picture from Harry, across the desk from the communicator.\n\n\u201cAntigravity!\u201d His voice was unbelieving as he turned his head to face\nthe older man. \u201cWhat world is that?\u201d\n\nGiles forced his attention on the picture again and this time he noticed\nthe vehicle shown. It was enough like an old model Earth conveyance to\npass casual inspection, but it floated wheellessly above the ground.\nFaint blur lines indicated it had been moving when the picture was\ntaken.\n\n\u201cOne of my sons\u2014\u201d Giles started to answer. \u201cI could find the star\u2019s\ndesignation....\u201d\n\nJordan cursed harshly. \u201cSo we can send a message on the shuttle, begging\nfor their secret in a couple of hundred years! While a hundred other\nworlds make a thousand major discoveries they don\u2019t bother reporting!\nCan\u2019t the Council see _anything_?\u201d\n\nGiles had heard it all before. Earth was becoming a backwater world; no\nreal progress had been made in two centuries; the young men were sent\nout as soon as their first fifty years of education were finished, and\nthe older men were too conservative for really new thinking. There was a\nmeasure of truth in it, unfortunately.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll slow up when their populations fill,\u201d Giles repeated his old\nanswers. \u201cWe\u2019re still ahead in medicine and we\u2019ll get the other\ndiscoveries eventually, without interrupting the work of making the\nEarth fit for our longevity. We can wait. We\u2019ll have to.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE YOUNGER man stared at him with the strange puzzled look Giles had\nseen too often lately. \u201cDamn it, haven\u2019t you read my report? We know the\nsuper-light drive works! That missile reached Sirius in less than ten\ndays. We can have the secret of this antigravity in less than a year!\nWe\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Giles felt the thickness pushing back at his mind and\ntried to fight it off. He\u2019d only skimmed the report, but this made no\nsense. \u201cYou mean you can calibrate your guiding devices accurately\nenough to get a missile where you want it and back?\u201d\n\n\u201c_What?_\u201d Jordan\u2019s voice rattled the speaker. \u201cOf course not! It took\ntwo accidents to get the thing back to us\u2014and with a half-light-year\nmiss that delayed it about twenty years before the Procyon shuttle heard\nits signal. Pre-setting a course may take centuries, if we can ever\nmaster it. Even with Sirius expecting the missiles and ready to\ncooperate. I mean the big ship. We\u2019ve had it drafted for building long\nenough; now we can finish it in three months. We know the drive works.\nWe know it\u2019s fast enough to reach Procyon in two weeks. We even know\nlife can stand the trip. The rats were unharmed.\u201d\n\nGiles shook his head at what the other was proposing, only partly\nbelieving it. \u201cRats don\u2019t have minds that could show any real damage\nsuch as the loss of power to rejuvenate. We can\u2019t put human pilots into\na ship with our drive until we\u2019ve tested it more thoroughly, Bill, even\nif they could correct for errors on arrival. Maybe if we put in stronger\nsignaling transmitters....\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Maybe in two centuries we\u2019d have a through route charted to\nSirius. And we still wouldn\u2019t have proved it safe for human pilots. Mr.\nGiles, we\u2019ve got to have the big ship. All we need is _one_ volunteer!\u201d\n\nIt occurred to Giles then that the man had been too fired with the idea\nto think. He leaned back, shaking his head again wearily. \u201cAll right,\nBill. Find me one volunteer. Or how about you? Do you really want to\nrisk losing the rest of your life rather than waiting a couple more\ncenturies until we know it\u2019s safe? If you do, I\u2019ll order the big ship.\u201d\n\nJordan opened his mouth and for a second Giles\u2019 heart caught in a flux\nof emotions as the man\u2019s offer hovered on his lips. Then the engineer\nshut his mouth slowly. The belligerence ran out of him.\n\nHe looked sick, for he had no answer.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nNO SANE man would risk a chance for near eternity against such a\nrelatively short wait. Heroism had belonged to those who knew their days\nwere numbered, anyhow.\n\n\u201cForget it, Bill,\u201d Giles advised. \u201cIt may take longer, but eventually\nwe\u2019ll find a way. With time enough, we\u2019re bound to. And when we do, the\nship will be ready.\u201d\n\nThe engineer nodded miserably and clicked off. Giles turned from the\nblank screen to stare out of the windows, while his hand came up to\ntwist at the lock of hair over his forehead. Eternity! They had to plan\nand build for it. They couldn\u2019t risk that plan for short-term benefits.\nUsually it was too easy to realize that, and the sight of the solid,\ntime-enduring buildings outside should have given him a sense of\nsecurity.\n\nToday, though, nothing seemed to help. He felt choked, imprisoned,\nsomehow lost; the city beyond the window blurred as he studied it, and\nhe swung the chair back so violently that his hand jerked painfully on\nthe forelock he\u2019d been twisting.\n\nThen he was staring unbelievingly at the single white hair that was\ntwisted with the dark ones between his fingers.\n\nLike an automaton, he bent forward, his other hand groping for the\nmirror that should be in one of the drawers. The dull pain in his chest\nsharpened and his breath was hoarse in his throat, but he hardly noticed\nas he found the mirror and brought it up. His eyes focused reluctantly.\nThere were other white strands in his dark hair.\n\nThe mirror crashed to the floor as he staggered out of the office.\n\nIt was only two blocks to Giles\u2019 residence club, but he had to stop\ntwice to catch his breath and fight against the pain that clawed at his\nchest. When he reached the wood-paneled lobby, he was barely able to\nstand.\n\nDubbins was at his side almost at once, with a hand under his arm to\nguide him toward his suite.\n\n\u201cLet me help you, sir,\u201d Dubbins suggested, in the tones Giles hadn\u2019t\nheard since the man had been his valet, back when it was still possible\nto find personal servants. Now he managed the club on a level of\nquasi-equality with the members. For the moment, though, he\u2019d slipped\nback into the old ways.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nGILES FOUND himself lying on his couch, partially undressed, with the\npillows just right and a long drink in his hand. The alcohol combined\nwith the reaction from his panic to leave him almost himself again.\nAfter all, there was nothing to worry about; Earth\u2019s doctors could cure\nanything.\n\n\u201cI guess you\u2019d better call Dr. Vincenti,\u201d he decided. Vincenti was a\nmember and would probably be the quickest to get.\n\nDubbins shook his head. \u201cDr. Vincenti isn\u2019t with us, sir. He left a year\nago to visit a son in the Centauri system. There\u2019s a Dr. Cobb whose\nreputation is very good, sir.\u201d\n\nGiles puzzled over it doubtfully. Vincenti had been an oddly morose man\nthe last few times he\u2019d seen him, but that could hardly explain his\ntaking a twenty-year shuttle trip for such a slim reason. It was no\nconcern of his, though. \u201cDr. Cobb, then,\u201d he said.\n\nGiles heard the other man\u2019s voice on the study phone, too low for the\nwords to be distinguishable. He finished the drink, feeling still\nbetter, and was sitting up when Dubbins came back.\n\n\u201cDr. Cobb wants you to come to his office at once, sir,\u201d he said,\ndropping to his knee to help Giles with his shoes. \u201cI\u2019d be pleased to\ndrive you there.\u201d\n\nGiles frowned. He\u2019d expected Cobb to come to him. Then he grimaced at\nhis own thoughts. Dubbins\u2019 manners must have carried him back into the\npast; doctors didn\u2019t go in for home visits now\u2014they preferred to see\ntheir patients in the laboratories that housed their offices. If this\nkept on, he\u2019d be missing the old days when he\u2019d had a mansion and\ncounted his wealth in possessions, instead of the treasures he could\nbuild inside himself for the future ahead. He was getting positively\nchildish!\n\nYet he relished the feeling of having Dubbins drive his car. More than\nanything else, he\u2019d loved being driven. Even after chauffeurs were a\nthing of the past, Harry had driven him around. Now he\u2019d taken to\nwalking, as so many others had, for even with modern safety measures so\nstrict, there was always a small chance of some accident and nobody had\nany desire to spend the long future as a cripple.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you, sir,\u201d Dubbins offered as they stopped beside the\nlow, massive medical building.\n\nIt was almost too much consideration. Giles nodded, got out and headed\ndown the hall uncertainly. Just how bad did he look? Well, he\u2019d soon\nfind out.\n\nHe located the directory and finally found the right office, its\nreception room wall covered with all the degrees Dr. Cobb had picked up\nin some three hundred years of practice. Giles felt better, realizing it\nwouldn\u2019t be one of the younger men.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nCOBB APPEARED himself, before the nurse could take over, and led Giles\ninto a room with an old-fashioned desk and chairs that almost concealed\nthe cabinets of equipment beyond.\n\nHe listened as Giles stumbled out his story. Halfway through, the nurse\ntook a blood sample with one of the little mosquito needles and the\nmachinery behind the doctor began working on it.\n\n\u201cYour friend told me about the gray hair, of course,\u201d Cobb said. At\nGiles\u2019 look, he smiled faintly. \u201cSurely you didn\u2019t think people could\nmiss that in this day and age? Let\u2019s see it.\u201d\n\nHe inspected it and began making tests. Some were older than Giles could\nremember\u2014knee reflex, blood pressure, pulse and fluoroscope. Others\ninvolved complicated little gadgets that ran over his body, while meters\nbobbed and wiggled. The blood check came through and Cobb studied it, to\ngo back and make further inspections of his own.\n\nAt last he nodded slowly. \u201cHyper-catabolism, of course. I thought it\nmight be. How long since you had your last rejuvenation? And who gave\nit?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout ten years ago,\u201d Giles answered. He found his identity card and\npassed it over, while the doctor studied it. \u201cMy sixteenth.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t going right. He could feel it. Some of the panic symptoms were\nreturning; the pulse in his neck was pounding and his breath was growing\ndifficult. Sweat ran down his sides from his armpit and he wiped his\npalms against his coat.\n\n\u201cAny particular emotional strain when you were treated\u2014some major upset\nin your life?\u201d Cobb asked.\n\nGiles thought as carefully as he could, but he remembered nothing like\nthat. \u201cYou mean\u2014it didn\u2019t take? But I never had any trouble, Doctor. I\nwas one of the first million cases, when a lot of people couldn\u2019t\nrejuvenate at all, and I had no trouble even then.\u201d\n\nCobb considered it, hesitated as if making up his mind to be frank\nagainst his better judgment. \u201cI can\u2019t see any other explanation. You\u2019ve\ngot a slight case of angina\u2014nothing serious, but quite definite\u2014as well\nas other signs of aging. I\u2019m afraid the treatment didn\u2019t take fully. It\nmight have been some unconscious block on your part, some infection not\ndiagnosed at the time, or even a fault in the treatment. That\u2019s pretty\nrare, but we can\u2019t neglect the possibility.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHE STUDIED his charts again and then smiled. \u201cSo we\u2019ll give you another\ntreatment. Any reason you can\u2019t begin immediately?\u201d\n\nGiles remembered that Dubbins was waiting for him, but this was more\nimportant. It hadn\u2019t been a joke about his growing old, after all. But\nnow, in a few days, he\u2019d be his old\u2014no, of course not\u2014his young self\nagain!\n\nThey went down the hall to another office, where Giles waited outside\nwhile Cobb conferred with another doctor and technician, with much\nwaving of charts. He resented every second of it. It was as if the\nalmost forgotten specter of age stood beside him, counting the seconds.\nBut at last they were through and he was led into the quiet rejuvenation\nroom, where the clamps were adjusted about his head and the earpieces\nwere fitted. The drugs were shot painlessly into his arm and the\nlight-pulser was adjusted to his brain-wave pattern.\n\nIt had been nothing like this his first time. Then it had required\nmonths of mental training, followed by crude mechanical and drug\nhypnosis for other months. Somewhere in every human brain lay the memory\nof what his cells had been like when he was young. Or perhaps it lay in\nthe cells themselves, with the brain as only a linkage to it. They\u2019d\ndiscovered that, and the fact that the mind could effect physical\nchanges in the body. Even such things as cancer could be willed out of\nexistence\u2014provided the brain could be reached far below the conscious\nlevel and forced to operate.\n\nThere had been impossible faith cures for millenia\u2014cataracts removed\nfrom blinded eyes within minutes, even\u2014but finding the mechanism in the\nbrain that worked those miracles had taken an incredible amount of study\nand finding a means of bringing it under control had taken even longer.\n\nNow they did it with dozens of mechanical aids in addition to the\nhypnotic instructions\u2014and did it usually in a single sitting, with the\nfull transformation of the body taking less than a week after the\ntreatment!\n\nBut with all the equipment, it wasn\u2019t impossible for a mistake to\nhappen. It had been no fault of his ... he was sure of that ... his mind\nwas easy to reach ... he could relax so easily....\n\nHe came out of it without even a headache, while they were removing the\nprobes, but the fatigue on the operator\u2019s face told him it had been a\nlong and difficult job. He stretched experimentally, with the eternal\nunconscious expectation that he would find himself suddenly young again.\nBut that, of course, was ridiculous. It took days for the mind to work\non all the cells and to repair the damage of time.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nCOBB LED him back to the first office, where he was given an injection\nof some kind and another sample of his blood was taken, while the\nearlier tests were repeated. But finally the doctor nodded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all for now, Mr. Giles. You might drop in tomorrow morning,\nafter I\u2019ve had a chance to complete my study of all this. We\u2019ll know by\nthen whether you\u2019ll need more treatment. Ten o\u2019clock okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll be all right?\u201d\n\nCobb smiled the automatic reassurance of his profession. \u201cWe haven\u2019t\nlost a patient in two hundred years, to my knowledge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Giles. \u201cTen o\u2019clock is fine.\u201d\n\nDubbins was still waiting, reading a paper whose headlined feature\ncarried a glowing account of the discovery of the super-light missile\nand what it might mean. He took a quick look at Giles and pointed to it.\n\u201cGreat work, Mr. Giles. Maybe we\u2019ll all get to see some of those other\nworlds yet.\u201d Then he studied Giles more carefully. \u201cEverything\u2019s in good\nshape now, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctor says everything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d Giles answered.\n\nIt was then he realized for the first time that Cobb had said no such\nthing. A statement that lightning had never struck a house was no\nguarantee that it never would. It was an evasion meant to give such an\nimpression.\n\nThe worry nagged at him all the way back. Word had already gone around\nthe club that he\u2019d had some kind of attack and there were endless\nquestions that kept it on his mind. And even when it had been covered\nand recovered, he could still sense the glances of the others, as if he\nwere Vincenti in one of the man\u2019s more morose moods.\n\nHe found a single table in the dining room and picked his way through\nthe meal, listening to the conversation about him only when it was\nnecessary because someone called across to him. Ordinarily, he was quick\nto support the idea of clubs in place of private families. A man here\ncould choose his group and grow into them. Yet he wasn\u2019t swallowed by\nthem, as he might be by a family. Giles had been living here for nearly\na century now and he\u2019d never regretted it. But tonight his own group\nirritated him.\n\nHe puzzled over it, finding no real reason. Certainly they weren\u2019t\nforcing themselves on him. He remembered once when he\u2019d had a cold,\nbefore they finally licked that; Harry had been a complete nuisance,\nrunning around with various nostrums, giving him no peace. Constant\nquestions about how he felt, constant little looks of worry\u2014until he\u2019d\nbeen ready to yell at the boy. In fact, he had.\n\nFunny, he couldn\u2019t picture really losing his temper here. Families did\nodd things to a man.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHE LISTENED to a few of the discussions after the dinner, but he\u2019d heard\nthem all before, except for one about the super-speed drive, and there\nhe had no wish to talk until he could study the final report. He gave up\nat last and went to his own suite. What he needed was a good night\u2019s\nsleep after a little relaxation.\n\nEven that failed him, though. He\u2019d developed one of the finest chess\ncollections in the world, but tonight it held no interest. And when he\ndrew out his tools and tried working on the delicate, lovely jade for\nthe set he was carving his hands seemed to be all thumbs. None of the\nother interests he\u2019d developed through the years helped to add to the\nrichness of living now.\n\nHe gave it up and went to bed\u2014to have the fragment of that song pop into\nhis head. Now there was no escaping it. Something about the years\u2014or was\nit days\u2014dwindling down to something or other.\n\nCould they really dwindle down? Suppose he couldn\u2019t rejuvenate all the\nway? He knew that there were some people who didn\u2019t respond as well as\nothers. Sol Graves, for instance. He\u2019d been fifty when he finally\nlearned how to work with the doctors and they could only bring him back\nto about thirty, instead of the normal early twenties. Would that reduce\nthe slice of eternity that rejuvenation meant? And what had happened to\nSol?\n\nOr suppose it wasn\u2019t rejuvenation, after all; suppose something had gone\nwrong with him permanently?\n\nHe fought that off, but he couldn\u2019t escape the nagging doubts at the\ndoctor\u2019s words.\n\nHe got up once to stare at himself in the mirror. Ten hours had gone by\nand there should have been some signs of improvement. He couldn\u2019t be\nsure, though, whether there were or not.\n\nHe looked no better the next morning when he finally dragged himself up\nfrom the little sleep he\u2019d managed to get. The hollows were still there\nand the circles under his eyes. He searched for the gray in his hair,\nbut the traitorous strands had been removed at the doctor\u2019s office and\nhe could find no new ones.\n\nHe looked into the dining room and then went by hastily. He wanted no\nsolicitous glances this morning. Drat it, maybe he should move out.\nMaybe trying family life again would give him some new interests. Amanda\nprobably would be willing to marry him; she\u2019d hinted at a date once.\n\nHe stopped, shocked by the awareness that he hadn\u2019t been out with a\nwoman for....\n\nHe couldn\u2019t remember how long it had been. Nor why.\n\n\u201cIn the spring, a young man\u2019s fancy,\u201d he quoted to himself, and then\nshuddered.\n\nIt hadn\u2019t been that kind of spring for him\u2014not this rejuvenation nor the\nlast, nor the one before that.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nGILES TRIED to stop scaring himself and partially succeeded, until he\nreached the doctor\u2019s office. Then it was no longer necessary to frighten\nhimself. The wrongness was too strong, no matter how professional Cobb\u2019s\nsmile!\n\nHe didn\u2019t hear the preliminary words. He watched the smile vanish as the\nstack of reports came out. There was no nurse here now. The machines\nwere quiet\u2014and all the doors were shut.\n\nGiles shook his head, interrupting the doctor\u2019s technical jargon. Now\nthat he knew there was reason for his fear, it seemed to vanish, leaving\na coldness that numbed him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather know the whole truth,\u201d he said. His voice sounded dead in\nhis ears. \u201cThe worst first. The rejuvenation...?\u201d\n\nCobb sighed and yet seemed relieved. \u201cFailed.\u201d He stopped, and his hands\ntouched the reports on his desk. \u201cCompletely,\u201d he added in a low,\ndefeated tone.\n\n\u201cBut I thought that was impossible!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did I. I wouldn\u2019t believe it even yet\u2014but now I find it isn\u2019t the\nfirst case. I spent the night at Medical Center going up the ranks until\nI found men who really know about it. And now I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d His\nvoice ran down and he gathered himself together by an effort. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nshock to me, too, Mr. Giles. But\u2014well, to simplify it, no memory is\nperfect\u2014even cellular memory. It loses a little each time. And the\neffect is cumulative. It\u2019s like an asymptotic curve\u2014the further it goes,\nthe steeper the curve. And\u2014well, you\u2019ve passed too far.\u201d\n\nHe faced away from Giles, dropping the reports into a drawer and locking\nit. \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to tell you, of course. It\u2019s going to be tough\nenough when they\u2019re ready to let people know. But you aren\u2019t the first\nand you won\u2019t be the last, if that\u2019s any consolation. We\u2019ve got a longer\ntime scale than we used to have\u2014but it\u2019s in centuries, not in eons. For\neverybody, not just you.\u201d\n\nIt was no consolation. Giles nodded mechanically. \u201cI won\u2019t talk, of\ncourse. How\u2014how long?\u201d\n\nCobb spread his hands unhappily. \u201cThirty years, maybe. But we can make\nthem better. Geriatric knowledge is still on record. We can fix the\nheart and all the rest. You\u2019ll be in good physical condition, better\nthan your grandfather\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then....\u201d Giles couldn\u2019t pronounce the words. He\u2019d grown old and\nhe\u2019d grow older. And eventually he\u2019d die!\n\nAn immortal man had suddenly found death hovering on his trail. The\nyears had dwindled and gone, and only a few were left.\n\nHe stood up, holding out his hand. \u201cThank you, Doctor,\u201d he said, and was\nsurprised to find he meant it. The man had done all he could and had at\nleast saved him the suspense of growing doubt and horrible eventual\ndiscovery.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nOUTSIDE ON the street, he looked up at the Sun and then at the buildings\nbuilt to last for thousands of years. Their eternity was no longer a\npart of him.\n\nEven his car would outlast him.\n\nHe climbed into it, still partly numbed, and began driving mechanically,\nno longer wondering about the dangers that might possibly arise. Those\nwouldn\u2019t matter much now. For a man who had thought of living almost\nforever, thirty years was too short a time to count.\n\nHe was passing near the club and started to slow. Then he went on\nwithout stopping. He wanted no chance to have them asking questions he\ncouldn\u2019t answer. It was none of their business. Dubbins had been\nkind\u2014but now Giles wanted no kindness.\n\nThe street led to the office and he drove on. What else was there for\nhim? There, at least, he could still fill his time with work\u2014work that\nmight even be useful. In the future, men would need the super-light\ndrive if they were to span much more of the Universe than now. And he\ncould speed up the work in some ways still, even if he could never see\nits finish.\n\nIt would be cold comfort but it was something. And he might keep busy\nenough to forget sometimes that the years were gone for him.\n\nAutomatic habit carried him through the office again, to Amanda\u2019s desk,\nwhere her worry was still riding her. He managed a grin and somehow the\nright words came to his lips. \u201cI saw the doctor, Amanda, so you can stop\nfiguring ways to get me there.\u201d\n\nShe smiled back suddenly, without feigning it. \u201cThen you\u2019re all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs all right as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey tell me I\u2019m just\ngrowing old.\u201d\n\nThis time her laugh was heartier. He caught himself before he could echo\nher mirth in a different voice and went inside where she had the coffee\nwaiting for him.\n\nOddly, it still tasted good to him.\n\nThe projection was off, he saw, wondering whether he\u2019d left it on or\nnot. He snapped the switch and saw the screen light up, with the people\nstill in the odd, wheelless vehicle on the alien planet.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nFOR A long moment, he stared at the picture without thinking, and then\nbent closer. Harry\u2019s face hadn\u2019t changed much. Giles had almost\nforgotten it, but there was still the same grin there. And his\ngrandchildren had a touch of it, too. And of their grandfather\u2019s nose,\nhe thought. Funny, he\u2019d never seen even pictures of his other\ngrandchildren. Family ties melted away too fast for interstellar travel.\n\nYet there seemed to be no slackening of them in Harry\u2019s case, and\nsomehow it looked like a family, rather than a mere group. A very\npleasant family in a very pleasant world.\n\nHe read Harry\u2019s note again, with its praise for the planet and its\ninvitation. He wondered if Dr. Vincenti had received an invitation like\nthat, before he left. Or had he even been one of those to whom the same\nreport had been delivered by some doctor? It didn\u2019t matter, but it would\nexplain things, at least.\n\nTwenty years to Centaurus, while the years dwindled down\u2014\n\nThen abruptly the line finished itself. \u201cThe years dwindle down to a\nprecious few....\u201d he remembered. \u201cA precious few.\u201d\n\nThose dwindling years had been precious once. He unexpectedly recalled\nhis own grandfather holding him on an old knee and slipping him candy\nthat was forbidden. The years seemed precious to the old man then.\n\nAmanda\u2019s voice came abruptly over the intercom. \u201cJordan wants to talk to\nyou,\u201d she said, and the irritation was sharp in her voice. \u201cHe won\u2019t\ntake no!\u201d\n\nGiles shrugged and reached for the projector, to cut it off. Then, on\nimpulse, he set it back to the picture, studying the group again as he\nswitched on Jordan\u2019s wire.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t wait for the hot words about whatever was the trouble.\n\n\u201cBill,\u201d he said, \u201cstart getting the big ship into production. I\u2019ve found\na volunteer.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d been driven to it, he knew, as he watched the man\u2019s amazed face\nsnap from the screen. From the first suspicion of his trouble, something\ninside him had been forcing him to make this decision. And maybe it\nwould do no good. Maybe the ship would fail. But thirty years was a\nnumber a man could risk.\n\nIf he made it, though....\n\nWell, he\u2019d see those grandchildren of his this year\u2014and Harry. Maybe\nhe\u2019d even tell Harry the truth, once they got done celebrating the\nreunion. And there\u2019d be other grandchildren. With the ship, he\u2019d have\ntime enough to look them up. Plenty of time!\n\nThirty years was a long time, when he stopped to think of it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nItalicized phrases are presented by surrounding the text with\n_underscores_.\n\nThe cover belongs to the entire publication, and does not particularly\nrelate to this etext.\n\nMinor changes in presentation have been made from the layout of the\noriginal paper publication.\n\nPunctuation has been normalized.
