    "body": "I suppose that every guy reaches a point once in his lifetime when he\ngets one hundred and forty per cent fed up with his wife.\n\nUnderstand now--I've got nothing against marriage or any thing\nlike that. Marriage is great. It's a good old red-blooded American\nInstitution. Except that it's got one defect in it big enough to throw\na cat through, especially when you happen to be married to a woman\nlike Marge--\n\nIt's so _permanent_.\n\nOh, I'd have divorced Marge in a minute if we'd been living in the\nBlissful 'Fifties--but with the Family Solidarity Amendment of 1968,\nand all the divorce taxes we have these days since the women got\ntheir teeth into politics, to say nothing of the Aggrieved Spouse\nCompensation Act, I'd have been a pauper for the rest of my life if\nI'd tried it. That's aside from the social repercussions involved.\n\nYou can't really blame me for looking for another way out. But a man\nhas to be desperate to try to buy himself an Ego Prime.\n\nSo, all right, I was desperate. I'd spent eight years trying to keep\nMarge happy, which was exactly seven and a half years too long.\n\nMarge was a dream to look at, with her tawny hair and her sulky eyes\nand a shape that could set your teeth chattering--but that was where\nthe dream stopped.\n\nShe had a tongue like a #10 wood rasp and a list of grievances long\nenough to paper the bedroom wall. When she wasn't complaining, she was\ncrying, and when she wasn't crying, she was pointing out in chilling\ndetail exactly where George Faircloth fell short as a model husband,\nwhich happened to be everywhere. Half of the time she had a \"beastly\nheadache\" (for which I was personally responsible) and the other half\nshe was sore about something, so ninety-nine per cent of the time we\ngot along like a couple of tomcats in a packing case.\n\n\n\nMaybe we just weren't meant for each other. I don't know. I used to\nenvy guys like Harry Folsom at the office. His wife is no joy to live\nwith either, but at least he could take a spin down to Rio once in a\nwhile with one of the stenographers and get away with it.\n\nI knew better than to try. Marge was already so jealous that I couldn't\neven smile at the company receptionist without a twinge of guilt. Give\nMarge something real to howl about, and I'd be ready for the Rehab\nCenter in a week.\n\nBut I'd underestimated Marge. She didn't need anything real, as I found\nout when Jeree came along.\n\nBusiness was booming and the secretaries at the office got shuffled\naround from time to time. Since I had an executive-type job, I got an\nexecutive-type secretary. Her name was Jeree and she was gorgeous. As\na matter of fact, she was better than gorgeous. She was the sort of\nsecretary every businessman ought to have in his office. Not to do any\nwork--just to sit there.\n\nJeree was tall and dark, and she could convey more without saying\nanything than I ever dreamed was possible. The first day she was\nthere, she conveyed to me very clearly that if I cared to supply the\nopportunity, she'd be glad to supply the motive.\n\nThat night, I could tell that Marge had been thinking something over\nduring the day. She let me get the first bite of dinner halfway to my\nmouth, and then she said, \"I hear you got a new secretary today.\"\n\nI muttered something into my coffee cup and pretended not to hear.\n\nMarge turned on her Accusing Look #7. \"I also hear that she's\nfive-foot-eight and tapes out at 38-25-36 and thinks you're handsome.\"\n\nMarge had quite a spy system.\n\n\"She couldn't be much of a secretary,\" she added.\n\n\"She's a perfectly good secretary,\" I blurted, and kicked myself\nmentally. I should have known Marge's traps by then.\n\nMarge exploded. I didn't get any supper, and she was still going strong\nat midnight. I tried to argue, but when Marge got going, there was no\nstopping her. I had my ultimatum, as far as Jeree was concerned.\n\nHarry Folsom administered the _coup de grace_ at coffee next morning.\n\"What you need is an Ego Prime,\" he said with a grin. \"Solve all your\nproblems. I hear they work like a charm.\"\n\nI set my coffee cup down. Bells were ringing in my ears. \"Don't be\nridiculous. It's against the law. Anyway, I wouldn't think of such a\nthing. It's--it's indecent.\"\n\nHarry shrugged. \"Just joking, old man, just joking. Still, it's fun to\nthink about, eh? Freedom from wife. Absolutely safe and harmless. Not\neven too expensive, if you've got the right contacts. And I've got a\nfriend who knows a guy--\"\n\nJust then, Jeree walked past us and flashed me a big smile. I gripped\nmy cup for dear life and still spilled coffee on my tie.\n\nAs I said, a guy gets fed up.\n\nAnd maybe opportunity would only knock once.\n\nAnd an Ego Prime would solve all my problems, as Harry had told me.\n\n\n\nIt was completely illegal, of course. The wonder was that Ego Prime,\nInc., ever got to put their product on the market at all, once the\nnation's housewives got wind of just what their product was.\n\nFrom the first, there was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the\nuse of Primes right down to the local level. You could get a license\nfor a Utility model Prime if you were a big business executive, or a\nhigh public official, or a movie star, or something like that; but even\nthen his circuits had to be inspected every two months, and he had to\nhave a thousand built-in Paralyzers, and you had to specify in advance\nexactly what you wanted your Prime to be able to do when, where, how,\nwhy, and under what circumstances.\n\nThe law didn't leave a man much leeway.\n\nBut everybody knew that if you _really_ wanted a personal Prime with\nall his circuits open and no questions asked, you could get one. Black\nmarket prices were steep and you ran your own risk, but it could be\ndone.\n\nHarry Folsom told his friend who knew a guy, and a few greenbacks got\nlost somewhere, and I found myself looking at a greasy little man with\na black mustache and a bald spot, up in a dingy fourth-story warehouse\noff lower Broadway.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" the little man said. \"Mr. Faircloth. We've been expecting\nyou.\"\n\n\n\nI didn't like the looks of the guy any more than the looks of the\nplace. \"I've been told you can supply me with a--\"\n\nHe coughed. \"Yes, yes. I understand. It might be possible.\" He fingered\nhis mustache and regarded me from pouchy eyes. \"Busy executives often\ncome to us to avoid the--ah--unpleasantness of formal arrangements.\nNaturally, we only act as agents, you might say. We never see the\nmerchandise ourselves--\" He wiped his hands on his trousers. \"Now were\nyou interested in the ordinary Utility model, Mr. Faircloth?\"\n\nI assumed he was just being polite. You didn't come to the back door\nfor Utility models.\n\n\"Or perhaps you'd require one of our Deluxe models. Very careful\nworkmanship. Only a few key Paralyzers in operation and practically\ncomplete circuit duplication. Very useful for--ah--close contact work,\nyou know. Social engagements, conferences--\"\n\nI was shaking my head. \"I want a _Super_ Deluxe model,\" I told him.\n\nHe grinned and winked. \"Ah, indeed! You want perfect duplication.\nYes, indeed. Domestic situations can be--awkward, shall we say. Very\nawkward--\"\n\nI gave him a cold stare. I couldn't see where my domestic problems were\nany affairs of his. He got the idea and hurried me back to a storeroom.\n\n\"We keep a few blanks here for the basic measurement. You'll go to our\nlaboratory on 14th Street to have the minute impressions taken. But I\ncan assure you you'll be delighted, simply delighted.\"\n\nThe blanks weren't very impressive--clay and putty and steel, faceless,\nbrainless. He went over me like a tailor, checking measurements of all\nsorts. He was thorough--embarrassingly thorough, in fact--but finally\nhe was finished. I went on to the laboratory.\n\nAnd that was all there was to it.\n\n\n\nPractical androids had been a pipe dream until Hunyadi invented the\nNeuro-pantograph. Hunyadi had no idea in the world what to do with it\nonce he'd invented it, but a couple of enterprising engineers bought\nhim body and soul, sub-contracted the problems of anatomy, design,\nartistry, audio and visio circuitry, and so forth, and ended up with\nthe modern Ego Primes we have today.\n\nI spent a busy two hours under the NP microprobes; the artists worked\noutside while the NP technicians worked inside. I came out of it pretty\nwoozy, but a shot of Happy-O set that straight. Then I waited in the\nrecovery room for another two hours, dreaming up ways to use my Prime\nwhen I got him. Finally the door opened and the head technician walked\nin, followed by a tall, sandy-haired man with worried blue eyes and a\ntired look on his face.\n\n\"Meet George Faircloth Prime,\" the technician said, grinning at me like\na nursing mother.\n\nI shook hands with myself. Good firm handshake, I thought admiringly.\nNothing flabby about it.\n\nI slapped George Prime on the shoulder happily. \"Come on, Brother,\" I\nsaid. \"You've got a job to do.\"\n\nBut, secretly, I was wondering what Jeree was doing that night.\n\nGeorge Prime had remote controls, as well as a completely recorded\nneurological analogue of his boss, who was me. George Prime thought\nwhat I thought about the same things I did in the same way I did. The\nonly difference was that what I told George Prime to do, George Prime\ndid.\n\nIf I told him to go to a business conference in San Francisco and make\nthe smallest possible concessions for the largest possible orders,\nhe would go there and do precisely that. His signature would be my\nsignature. It would hold up in court.\n\nAnd if I told him that my wife Marge was really a sweet, good-hearted\ngirl and that he was to stay home and keep her quiet and happy any time\nI chose, he'd do that, too.\n\nGeorge Prime was a duplicate of me right down to the sandy hairs on\nthe back of my hands. Our fingerprints were the same. We had the same\nmannerisms and used the same figures of speech. The only physical\ndifference apparent even to an expert was the tiny finger-depression\nburied in the hair above his ear. A little pressure there would stop\nGeorge Prime dead in his tracks.\n\nHe was so lifelike, even I kept forgetting that he was basically just a\npile of gears.\n\nI'd planned very carefully how I meant to use him, of course.\n\nEvery man who's been married eight years has a sanctuary. He builds it\nup and maintains it against assault in the very teeth of his wife's\nnatural instinct to clean, poke, pry and rearrange things. Sometimes\nit takes him years of diligent work to establish his hideout and be\nconfident that it will stay inviolate, but if he starts early enough,\nand sticks with it long enough, and is fierce enough and persistent\nenough and crafty enough, he'll probably win in the end. The girls hate\nhim for it, but he'll win.\n\nWith some men, it's just a box on their dressers, or a desk, or a\ncorner of an unused back room. But I had set my sights high early in\nthe game. With me, it was the whole workshop in the garage.\n\n\n\nAt first, Marge tried open warfare. She had to clean the place up, she\nsaid. I told her I didn't _want_ her to clean it up. She could clean\nthe whole house as often as she chose, but _I_ would clean up the\nworkshop.\n\nAfter a couple of sharp engagements on that field, Marge staged a\nstrategic withdrawal and reorganized her attack. A little pile of wood\nshavings would be on the workshop floor one night and be gone the next.\nA wrench would be back on the rack--upside down, of course. An open\npaint can would have a cover on it.\n\nI always knew. I screamed loudly and bitterly. I ranted and raved. I\nswore I'd rig up a booby-trap with a shotgun.\n\nSo she quit trying to clean in there and just went in once in a while\nto take a look around. I fixed that with the old toothpick-in-the-door\nroutine. Every time she so much as set foot in that workshop, she had a\nbattle on her hands for the next week or so. She could count on it. It\nwas that predictable.\n\nShe never found out how I knew, and after seven years or so, it wore\nher down. She didn't go into the workshop any more.\n\nAs I said, you've got to be persistent, but you'll win.\n\nEventually.\n\nIf you're _really_ persistent.\n\nNow all my effort paid off. I got Marge out of the house for an hour\nor two that day and had George Prime delivered and stored in the big\ncloset in the workshop. They hooked his controls up and left me a\nmanual of instructions for running him. When I got home that night,\nthere he was, just waiting to be put to work.\n\nAfter supper, I went out to the workshop--to get the pipe I'd left\nthere, I said. I pushed George Prime's button, winked at him and\nswitched on the free-behavior circuits.\n\n\"Go to it, Brother,\" I said.\n\nGeorge Prime put my pipe in his mouth, lit it and walked back into the\nhouse.\n\nFive minutes later, I heard them fighting.\n\nIt sounded so familiar that I laughed out loud. Then I caught a cab on\nthe corner and headed uptown.\n\nWe had quite a night, Jeree and I. I got home just about time to start\nfor work, and sure enough, there was George Prime starting my car,\nbusiness suit on, briefcase under his arm.\n\nI pushed the recall and George Prime got out of the car and walked into\nthe workshop. He stepped into his cradle in the closet. I turned him\noff and then drove away in the car.\n\nBless his metallic soul, he'd even kissed Marge good-by for me!\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, the affairs of George Faircloth took on a new sparkle\nwith George Prime on hand to cover the home front.\n\nFor the first week, I was hardly home at all. I must say I felt a\nlittle guilty, leaving poor old George Prime to cope with Marge all\nthe time--he looked and acted so human, it was easy to forget that\nhe literally couldn't care less. But I felt apologetic all the same\nwhenever I took him out of his closet.\n\n\"She's really a sweet girl underneath it all,\" I'd say. \"You'll learn\nto like her after a bit.\"\n\n\"Of course I like her,\" George Prime said. \"You told me to, didn't you?\nStop worrying. She's really a sweet girl underneath it all.\"\n\nHe sounded convincing enough, but still it bothered me. \"You're sure\nyou understand the exchange mechanism?\" I asked. I didn't want any\nfoul-ups there, as you can imagine.\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said George Prime. \"When you buzz the recall, I wait for\nthe first logical opportunity I can find to come out to the workshop,\nand you take over.\"\n\n\"But you might get nervous. You might inadvertently tip her off.\"\n\nGeorge Prime looked pained. \"Really, old man! I'm a Super Deluxe model,\nremember? I don't have fourteen activated Hunyadi tubes up in this\ncranial vault of mine just for nothing. You're the one that's nervous.\nI'll take care of everything. Relax.\"\n\nSo I did.\n\nJeree made good all her tacit promises and then some. She had a very\ncozy little apartment on 34th Street where we went to relax after\na hard day at the office. When we weren't doing the town, that is.\nAs long as Jeree didn't try too much conversation, everything was\nwonderful.\n\nAnd then, when Jeree got a little boring, there was Sybil in the\naccounting department. Or Dorothy in promotion. Or Jane. Or Ingrid.\n\nI could go on at some length, but I won't. I was building quite a\nreputation for myself around the office.\n\nOf course, it was like buying your first 3-V set. In a week or so, the\nnovelty wears off a little and you start eating on schedule again. It\ntook a little while, but I finally had things down to a reasonable\nprogram.\n\nTuesday and Thursday nights, I was informally \"out\" while formally\n\"in.\" Sometimes I took Sunday nights \"out\" if things got too sticky\naround the house over the weekend. The rest of the time, George Prime\ncooled his heels in his closet. Locked up, of course. Can't completely\ntrust a wife to observe a taboo, no matter how well trained she is.\n\nThere, was an irreconcilable amount of risk. George Prime had to\nquick-step some questions about my work at the office--there was no\nway to supply him with current data until the time for his regular\ntwo-month refill and pattern-accommodation at the laboratory. In the\nmeantime, George Prime had to make do with what he had.\n\nBut as he himself pointed out he was a Super Deluxe model.\n\n\n\nMarge didn't suspect a thing. In fact, George Prime seemed to be having\na remarkable effect on her. I didn't notice anything at first--I was\nhardly ever home. But one night I found my pipe and slippers laid out\nfor me, and the evening paper neatly folded on my chair, and it brought\nme up short. Marge had been extremely docile lately. We hadn't had a\ngood fight in days. Weeks, come to think of it.\n\nI thought it over and shrugged. Old age, I figured. She was bound to\nmellow sometime.\n\nBut pretty soon I began to wonder if she wasn't mellowing a little too\nmuch.\n\nOne night when I got home, she kissed me almost as though she really\nmeant it. There wasn't an unpleasant word all through dinner, which\nhappened to be steak with mushrooms, served in the dining room (!) by\ncandlelight (!!) with dinner music that Marge could never bear, chiefly\nbecause I liked it.\n\nWe sat over coffee and cigarettes, and it seemed almost like old\ntimes. _Very_ old times, in fact I even caught myself looking at Marge\nagain--really _looking_ at her, watching the light catch in her hair,\nalmost admiring the sparkle in her brown eyes. Sparkle, I said, not\nglint.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Marge was always easy to look at. That night,\nshe was practically ravishing.\n\n\"What are you doing to her?\" I asked George Prime later, out in the\nworkshop.\n\n\"Why, nothing,\" said George Prime, looking innocent. He couldn't fool\nme with his look, though, because it was exactly the look I use when\nI'm guilty and pretending to be innocent.\n\n\"There must be _something_.\"\n\nGeorge Prime shrugged. \"Any woman will warm up if you spend enough time\ntelling her all the things she wants to hear and pay all the attention\nto her that she wants paid to her. That's elemental psychology. I can\ngive you page references.\"\n\nI ought to mention that George Prime had a complete set of basic texts\nrun into his circuits, at a slightly additional charge. Never can tell\nwhen an odd bit of information will come in useful.\n\n\"Well, you must be doing quite a job,\" I said. _I'd_ never managed to\nwarm Marge up much.\n\n\"I try,\" said George Prime.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not complaining,\" I hastened to add, forgetting that a Prime's\nfeelings can't be hurt and that he was only acting like me because it\nwas in character. \"I was just curious.\"\n\n\"Of course, George.\"\n\n\"I'm really delighted that you're doing so well.\"\n\n\"Thank you, George.\"\n\nBut the next night when I was with Dawn, who happens to be a gorgeous\nredhead who could put Marge to shame on practically any field of battle\nexcept maybe brains, I kept thinking about Marge all evening long, and\nwondering if things weren't getting just a little out of hand.\n\n\n\nThe next evening I almost tripped over George Prime coming out of a\nliquor store. I ducked quickly into an alley and flagged him. \"_What\nare you doing out on the street?_\"\n\nHe gave me my martyred look. \"Just buying some bourbon. You were out.\"\n\n\"But you're not supposed to be off the premises--\"\n\n\"Marge asked me to come. I couldn't tell her I was sorry, but her\nhusband wouldn't let me, could I?\"\n\n\"Well, certainly not--\"\n\n\"You want me to keep her happy, don't you? You don't want her to get\nsuspicious.\"\n\n\"No, but suppose somebody saw us together! If she ever got a hint--\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" George Prime said contritely. \"It seemed the right thing\nto do. _You_ would have done it. At least that's what my judgment\ncenter maintained. We had quite an argument.\"\n\n\"Well, tell your judgment center to use a little sense,\" I snapped. \"I\ndon't want it to happen again.\"\n\nThe next night, I stayed home, even though it was Tuesday night. I was\nbeginning to get worried. Of course, I did have complete control--I\ncould snap George Prime off any time I wanted, or even take him in for\na complete recircuiting--but it seemed a pity. He was doing such a nice\njob.\n\nMarge was docile as a kitten, even more so than before. She sympathized\nwith my hard day at the office and agreed heartily that the boss,\ndespite all appearances, was in reality a jabbering idiot. After\ndinner, I suggested a movie, but Marge gave me an odd sort of look and\nsaid she thought it would be much nicer to spend the evening at home by\nthe fire.\n\nI'd just gotten settled with the paper when she came into the living\nroom and sat down beside me. She was wearing some sort of filmy affair\nI'd never laid eyes on before, and I caught a whiff of my favorite\nperfume.\n\n\"Georgie?\" she said.\n\n\"Uh?\"\n\n\"Do you still love me?\"\n\nI set the paper down and stared at her. \"How's that? Of course I\nstill--\"\n\n\"Well, sometimes you don't act much like it.\"\n\n\"Mm. I guess I've--uh--got an awful headache tonight.\" Damn that\nperfume!\n\n\"Oh,\" said Marge.\n\n\"In fact, I thought I'd turn in early and get some sleep--\"\n\n\"Sleep,\" said Marge. There was no mistaking the disappointment in her\nvoice. Now I knew that things were out of hand.\n\nThe next evening, I activated George Prime and caught the taxi at the\ncorner, but I called Ruby and broke my date with her. I took in an\nearly movie alone and was back by ten o'clock. I left the cab at the\ncorner and walked quietly up the path toward the garage.\n\nThen I stopped. I could see Marge and George Prime through the living\nroom windows.\n\nGeorge Prime was kissing my wife the way I hadn't kissed her in eight\nlong years. It made my hair stand on end. And Marge wasn't exactly\nfighting him off, either. She was coming back for more. After a little,\nthe lights went off.\n\nGeorge Prime was a Super Deluxe model, all right.\n\n\n\nI dashed into the workshop and punched the recall button as hard as I\ncould, swearing under my breath. How long had this been going on? I\npunched the button again, viciously, and waited.\n\nGeorge Prime didn't come out.\n\nIt was plenty cold out in the workshop that night and I didn't sleep\na wink. About dawn, out came George Prime, looking like a man with a\nfour-day hangover.\n\nOur conversation got down to fundamentals. George Prime kept insisting\nblandly that, according to my own directions, he was to pick the first\nlogical opportunity to come out when I buzzed, and that was exactly\nwhat he'd done.\n\nI was furious all the way to work. I'd take care of this nonsense, all\nright. I'd have George Prime rewired from top to bottom as soon as the\nlaboratory could take him.\n\nBut I never phoned the laboratory. The bank was calling me when I got\nto the office. They wanted to know what I planned to do about that\ncheck of mine that had just bounced.\n\n\"What check?\" I asked.\n\n\"The one you wrote to cash yesterday--five hundred dollars--against\nyour regular account, Mr. Faircloth.\"\n\nThe last I'd looked, I'd had about three thousand dollars in that\naccount. I told the man so rather bluntly.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir. That is, you _did_ until last week. But all these checks\nyou've been cashing have emptied the account.\"\n\nHe flashed the checks on the desk screen. My signature was on every one\nof them.\n\n\"What about my special account?\" I'd learned long before that an\naccount Marge didn't know about was sound rear-guard strategy.\n\n\"That's been closed out for two weeks.\"\n\nI hadn't written a check against that account for over a year! I glared\nat the ceiling and tried to think things through.\n\nI came up with a horrible thought.\n\nMarge had always had her heart set on a trip to Bermuda. Just to get\naway from it all, she'd say. A second honeymoon.\n\nI got a list of travel agencies from the business directory and started\ndown them. The third one I tried had a pleasant tenor voice. \"No, sir,\nnot _Mrs._ Faircloth. _You_ bought two tickets. One way. Champagne\nflight to Bermuda.\"\n\n\"When?\" I choked out.\n\n\"Why, today, as a matter of fact. It leaves Idlewild at eleven\no'clock--\"\n\nI let him worry about my amnesia and started home fast. I didn't know\nwhat they'd given that Prime for circuits, but there was no question\nnow that he was out of control--_way_ out of control. And poor Marge,\nall worked up for a second honeymoon--\n\nThen it struck me. Poor Marge? Poor sucker George! No Prime in his\nright circuits would behave this way without some human guidance and\nthat meant only one thing: Marge had spotted him. It had happened\nbefore. Couple of nasty court battles I'd read about. And she'd known\nall about George Prime.\n\n_For how long?_\n\n\n\nWhen I got home, the house was empty. George Prime wasn't in his\ncloset. And Marge wasn't in the house.\n\nThey were gone.\n\nI started to call the police, but caught myself just in time. I\ncouldn't very well complain to the cops that my wife had run off with\nan android.\n\nWorse yet, I could get twenty years for having an illegal Prime\nwandering around.\n\nI sat down and poured myself a stiff drink.\n\nMy own wife deserting me for a pile of bearings.\n\nIt was indecent.\n\nThen I heard the front door open and there was Marge, her arms full of\ngrocery bundles. \"Why, darling! You're home early!\"\n\nI just blinked for a moment. Then I said, \"You're still here!\"\n\n\"Of course. Where did you think I'd be?\"\n\n\"But I thought--I mean the ticket office--\"\n\nShe set down the bundles and kissed me and looked up into my eyes,\nalmost smiling, half reproachful. \"You didn't really think I'd go\nrunning off with something out of a lab, did you?\"\n\n\"Then--you knew?\"\n\n\"Certainly I knew, silly. You didn't do a very good job of instructing\nhim, either. You gave him far too much latitude. Let him have ideas of\nhis own and all that. And next thing I knew, he was trying to get me to\nrun off with him to Hawaii or someplace.\"\n\n\"Bermuda,\" I said.\n\nAnd then Marge was in my arms, kissing me and snuggling her cheek\nagainst my chest.\n\n\"Even though he looked like you, I knew he couldn't be,\" she said. \"He\nwas like you, but he wasn't _you_, darling. And all I ever want is you.\nI just never appreciated you before....\"\n\nI held her close and tried to keep my hands from shaking. George\nFaircloth, Idiot, I thought. She'd never been more beautiful. \"But what\ndid you do with him?\"\n\n\"I sent him back to the factory, naturally. They said they could blot\nhim out and use him over again. But let's not talk about that any more.\nWe've got more interesting things to discuss.\"\n\nMaybe we had, but we didn't waste a lot of time talking. It was the\nMarge I'd once known and I was beginning to wonder how I could have\nbeen so wrong about her. In fact unless my memory was getting awfully\nporous, the old Marge was _never_ like this--\n\nI kissed her tenderly and ran my hands through her hair, and felt\nthe depression with my fore-finger, and then I knew what had really\nhappened.\n\nThat Marge always had been a sly one.\n\nI wondered how she was liking things in Bermuda.\n\n\n\nMarge probably thought she'd really put me where I belonged, but the\nlaugh was on her, after all.\n\nAs I said, the old Marge was never like the new one. Marge Prime makes\nJeree and Sybil and Dorothy and Dawn and Jane and Ruby all look pretty\nsad by comparison.\n\nShe cooks like a dream and she always brings me my pipe and slippers.\nAs they say, there's nothing a man likes more than to be appreciated.\n\nA hundred per cent appreciated, with a factory guarantee to correct any\nslippage, which would only be temporary, anyhow.\n\nOne of these days, we'll take that second honeymoon. But I think we'll\ngo to Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\n",
