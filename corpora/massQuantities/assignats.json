These men were sitting on their haunches staring out\nover the Japan Sea. Ivan spoke to them in English.\n\n\u201cI have a ship,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first man glanced at the second; the second stared at the third.\nThey rose from their haunches and wrapped their rags around gaunt\nlimbs.\n\n\u201cA ship in this accursed port?\u201d asked one.\n\n\u201cA bloody lie!\u201d exclaimed a second castaway.\n\n\u201cAh hae me doots,\u201d rasped a third derelict.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact, gentlemen,\u201d said Ivan with the long surname. \u201cThe ship\nis loading between here and Vladivostok. She wants but a master, a\nmate and an engineer.\u201d\n\nThe three men grew sad. They had been broken on the rack of peace.\nThey had come ashore at Novgorod in a leaking sampan. The government\nof Japan was at that moment interested in their whereabouts.\n\n\u201cOur papers were lost in a great storm at sea,\u201d said the leader of\nthe trio, whom men called \u201cMicky\u201d McMasters. \u201cYou mind the vast\nsimoom?\u201d\n\nIvan, the Russian, spread out his hands. His great spade-shaped beard\nfluttered in the warm Japanese breeze. He thumped a be-medaled chest.\n\n\u201cCome with me!\u201d he said. \u201cPapers or no papers--it is you three who\nshall take the _Shongpong_ out across the sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe talks like a poet writes,\u201d whispered \u201cRed\u201d Landyard, a Yankee\nmate, to Mike Monkey, the Scotch engineer.\n\n\u201cAh hae noo doot he\u2019s read a wee bit. How otherwise would he know we\nwere on the beach at Novgorod? There is a price on our heads.\u201d\n\nMicky McMasters edged the big Russian away from his whispering\ncompanions.\n\n\u201cThis ship,\u201d asked the little skipper, \u201cthis boat you \u2019ave loading\nbetween \u2019ere and Vladivostok--what flag does she fly?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer home flag is Chinese. Her crew are loyal Russians. Her cargo,\nnow going aboard, is caravan tea. This tea must be taken to America\nwhere Victoria on the Island of Vancouver is. Do you know the route?\u201d\n\nMicky felt his heart thump like a mallet inside a cask. He had\nsweated and toiled and starved on the mud flats of Novgorod. He\nsensed the coming of a bitter Winter. And here was a hard-eyed\nRussian offering him and his mates a ship for the Pacific broadside,\nwhere white men walked and roses bloomed and shirts could be worn.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve steamed and sailed, man and boy,\u201d he explained, \u201cgoing on\nthirty years. I\u2019m \u2019Umber born--at Great Grimsby on the North Sea. My\nmate, the tall man with the red face, is an American out of New\nBedford. My first engineer came from Tyneside--where they build good\nships. We take no back-slack from nobody. Show me your ship, says I,\nand I\u2019ll work \u2019er across the Japan Sea and east by the line to\nVictoria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is settled,\u201d said Ivan Alexandrovski. \u201cYou may come with me.\u201d\n\nMicky McMasters gathered the tattered collar of his dungaree coat\naround his unshaven neck.\n\n\u201cOne more question before it becomes a contract,\u201d he said\nsuspiciously. \u201cAre you loyal Russian or are you Bolshevik?\u201d\n\nIvan with the long surname smiled blandly. He stroked his straggling\nbeard. He stared down at the little castaway.\n\n\u201cLoyal Russian,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a home in Vladivostok--where Allied\ntroops are guarding.\u201d\n\nMicky turned, jerked his head toward his mates who stood shivering in\ntheir rags, and shouted:\n\n\u201cThe contract\u2019s signed! A fair thing for all of us. We work the\n_Shongpong_ across the western Pacific.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe arranged about terms?\u201d asked Mike Monkey, siding up to the\nskipper and glancing at the Russian.\n\n\u201cTerms?\u201d\n\n\u201cBonuses and wages?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave that to our noble friend.\u201d\n\nMike gulped and spat to the mud flat.\n\n\u201cLast time Ah left that,\u201d he said, \u201cAh had nothing coming to me when\nAh went ashore.\u201d\n\nThe Russian drew himself erect.\n\n\u201cThe scale of wages,\u201d he declared, \u201cshall be, for you three officers,\none thousand rubles a week--paid at Victoria.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much is a ruble?\u201d asked Mike.\n\n\u201cTwo shillin\u2019,\u201d hissed the cockney skipper.\n\n\u201cTwa shillin\u2019? That make a hundred pun a week! Ah hae noo doot it\u2019ll\nbe well earned before the end of the passage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the ship?\u201d asked Red Landyard. \u201cShow me the _Shongpong_!\u201d\n\nThe Russian led the way up the beach. Two hours stiff walking brought\nthe castaways to a cove in which lay a rusty tramp flying the Chinese\nflag and swarming with coolies--like ants on a cockroach.\n\nMike Monkey stared at the boxes which the coolies were carrying\naboard the ship.\n\n\u201cTay!\u201d he spat. \u201cAya, it may be tay and it may be something else.\nThem ain\u2019t Chinese marks on the sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussian!\u201d explained Ivan. \u201cCome with me aboard my ship. You can see\nthe boxes are marked with Russian letters.\u201d\n\nMicky McMasters jabbed the engineer in the ribs as they trailed up a\nshaky gangplank and sprang from the _Shongpong\u2019s_ unpolished rail at\nthe waist.\n\n\u201cBe careful!\u201d he warned. \u201cDon\u2019t ask no bloomin\u2019 questions. Wait till\nwe cross the Sea o\u2019 Japan!\u201d\n\nMike gulped. He eyed the decrepit back-stays and standing rigging of\nthe tramp. He ranged a fluttering glance along the dirty planks of\nthe freighter. He shifted his tongue in his mouth as he stared at the\ndrunken-looking funnel, which bore evidences of poorly patched shot\nholes.\n\n\u201cA rum hooker,\u201d he told Red Landyard. \u201cShe\u2019s had her name painted out\nabout five times. She\u2019s no more\u2019n eight hundred tons, if she\u2019s that.\nShe\u2019s a broodin\u2019 menace ov some kind. Ah wash my hands of this\nvoyage.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re \u2019ands need washin\u2019!\u201d snapped Micky McMasters. \u201cDrop below and\nlook over the engines. See hif there\u2019s any coal or supplies aboard.\nReport to me on the bridge.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019ye call that a bridge?\u201d Mike pointed forward of the tipsy funnel,\nwhich was painted light blue.\n\n\u201cHit\u2019s a better bridge than the mud flats of Novgorod!\u201d Micky said.\n\u201cGet below and report. I\u2019m skipper \u2019ere!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nMike\u2019s report, delivered between champs upon a chew of Chinese\ntobacco borrowed from a coolie, was tense and bitter.\n\n\u201cYe hae no conception of the state of things below,\u201d he told Micky\nMcMasters. \u201cThere\u2019s only one double-door boiler. It was made in\nCanton--China. The engines are cross-compound of the vintage of Isaac\nWatt and Robert Fulton. The coal is Japanese--twa bunkers of it. The\nstokehold leaks and the shaft-alley is full of bilge muck. Ah saw the\nstuffin\u2019-boxes jettin\u2019 water myself. The last engineer of this packet\nwrote wot he thought of it on the ditty-box door. He said enough. His\nname was MacFarland.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with hus?\u201d\n\nMike walked from starboard to port of the tramp. He stared down at\nthe line of coolies who were staggering aboard under the last of the\nboxes. He watched the yellow hands of the gang in the forehold reach\nfor the cargo. He came back to Micky McMasters.\n\n\u201cWot\u2019s it got to do with us?\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s got a lot. Ah doot\nif we make Japan--let alone Victoria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try,\u201d said Micky sadly. \u201cThe Russian says we can clear at\nnightfall. \u2019E and \u2019is crew are coming aboard then. I tested the\nsteering-gear. It works. Who got steam up?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree coolies who are sittin\u2019 in the engine-room waiting to go\nashore. Ah borrowed some cut-plug from them--enough to last the\nvoyage--if it lasts. They can\u2019t talk anything but pidgin English.\nTheir clothes are not worth taking--or I\u2019d of taken them.\u201d\n\nMicky McMasters rubbed a bristly chin reflectively. He stared at Mike\nMonkey\u2019s faded outfit. He swung his gaze to where Red Landyard stood\non the forecastle deck, directing a gang of coolies who were clearing\naway wreckage which had fallen about the capstan.\n\n\u201cThis Russian,\u201d he said with an anxious glance at the dark outlines\nof the shore, \u201cthis man who hired us at a thousand rubles a week is\nsome kind of a big labor captain or prince. The coolies salute him.\nThe two Tatars standing guard at that shed ashore bowed when he spoke\nto them. There\u2019s a whackin\u2019 mystery \u2019ere!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh thought ye would get yer foot in it when ah saw ye chinnin\u2019 with\nthat Russian on the mud flat. He is a smuggler!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! \u2019E don\u2019t look like one.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks is only skin deep. He ought to be skinned--with his thousand\nrubles a week.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019E \u2019as nobody to navigate the ship, and the tea \u2019as got to be taken\nhover the western Pacific.\u201d\n\n\u201cTay? Ye are daft? D\u2019ye call that tay?\u201d\n\nMike Monkey pointed a scornful finger at the boxes piled around the\nfore-hatch. He spat to the bridge-deck.\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t tay! That\u2019s opium or hashish or fireworks of some sort.\nAh never saw tay boxes with Russian letters on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is good tea grown in some parts of Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s grown! Aye, it\u2019s grown! Wot\u2019s to prove this cargo growed there.\nIt may have been brought to this cove in a sampan--it may have been\nbrought in a Chinese junk--it may have----\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Vast with your \u2018may-have\u2019s!\u2019 Get below to the boiler! \u2019Ere comes a\ncaravan or a funeral. They\u2019re Russians of the province of the Don.\nSee their beards and their robes. There\u2019s the big fellow who hired\nus. \u2019E\u2019s a bloomin\u2019 juke, that\u2019s wot \u2019e is! Kow-tow when \u2019e comes\naboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe told me to go below.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019urry hup! Never mind the kowtowin\u2019. You walk straight and take my\norders until we get on the \u2019igh seas.\u201d\n\nThe first engineer fluttered a pair of pale lashes in the general\ndirection of the squad of Russians who were winding around the shore\nshed. He climbed down the rusty bridge-ladder and glided for the\nengine-room companion. He went through the single grating and thrust\nhis hands into the broken pockets of his dungaree trousers as he eyed\nthe three coolies sitting on the crank-shaft of the cross-compound\nengine.\n\n\u201cOn deck!\u201d he roared at the chinamen. \u201cYe all get on deck, and don\u2019t\nshow yer miserable faces here again. Ye\u2019re discharged! Ye built my\nfires in Oriental fashion--upside down with all the Japanese coal on\nthe grates. Ye left me nothing but clinkers and salt water in the\nboiler and leaking gaskets and----\u201d\n\nThe last yellow man stared down through the grating on his way to the\ndeck and departure.\n\n\u201cPlenty much you learn by and by,\u201d he said softly--too softly.\n\u201cPlenty much----\u201d\n\nMike picked up a rusty spanner. He had drawn this back when there\nsounded the raucous clang of an ancient gong in the engine-room.\nMicky McMasters, wasting no time, had rung for quarter-speed forward\nbefore the Russian crew were well aboard.\n\nTwo men came down the engine-room ladder in awkward fashion. They\nblinked at Mike. They stared at the engine as if it were an idol in a\ntemple. They stroked their whiskers.\n\n\u201cAre ye coal-passers?\u201d asked Mike.\n\n\u201cPassengers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWot?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are passengers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh asked ye if ye are coal-passers?\u201d\n\nMike Monkey pointed toward the low door through the bulkhead which\nseparated the engine-room from the stoke hold.\n\n\u201cGet forrard!\u201d he rasped. \u201cD\u2019ye know the skipper rang for a turn on\nthe engines? D\u2019ye know there\u2019s only thirty pounds ov steam?\u201d\n\nThe Russians moved toward the stokehold door. Mike picked up his\nspanner and followed them. He spent the next lurid hour breaking in\ntwo green firemen whose manners were sullen and morose.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was after sundown when the _Shongpong_ clamped from her anchorage\nin the cove and started eastward over the polished waters of the\nJapan Sea.\n\nA tan-colored moon hung in the sky. A soft breeze swung out from\nManchuria. The powdered stars spangled the velvet dome of heaven.\n\nRed Landyard, Micky Masters and Mike Monkey came together on the\ndecrepit bridge of the freighter like three men making a common\nreport.\n\nIvan with the long surname and most of his following were in the\nlighted cabin where rose the quarter-deck of the freighter. A lone\nlookout stood on the forecastle head. He was smoking a long-stemmed\npipe. The ashes from the bowl of this pipe made tinder of his\nwhiskers. Now and then he pressed out the sparks and swore in\nRussian.\n\nA second and sinister figure squatted on the fore-hatch. He had a\nrifle across his knees. The end of this rifle was tipped with a\npolished bayonet.\n\n\u201cStandin\u2019 guard,\u201d said Micky McMasters. \u201cThe grand juke put \u2019im there\nto watch the tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cTay!\u201d said Mike Monkey. \u201cYe still insist it is tay?\u201d\n\nMicky squared his jaw. \u201cI know nothing,\u201d he said, \u201csave that we are\n\u2019oldin\u2019 a course for \u2019Akodate and the Inland Sea, which we should\nreach this time day after tomorrow--if the steam don\u2019t die out\naltogether.\u201d\n\nRed Landyard stared at the Russian on the fore-hatch. He eyed the\nbright point of the steel bayonet.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re quiet now,\u201d he drawled, \u201cbut we\u2019re hardly out of sight of\nland. I expect I\u2019ll have to chain a man or two before long. The\nforecastle is a volcano. Hear them talking? They\u2019re arguing some\npoint in Russian.\u201d\n\nMicky swung and eyed the break of the quarter-deck, which showed four\nlighted port-holes within the smudge of smoke that draped from the\ntipsy funnel.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing the same aft,\u201d he said. \u201cIvan, the grand juke, is\nleadin\u2019 in the prayin\u2019 or whatever it is. I never saw such a crew for\ntalking. I don\u2019t know who are passengers and who are workin\u2019 the\nship. I wish I\u2019d studied Russian.\u201d\n\n\u201cWot good would that do?\u201d asked Mike Monkey. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t reveal\ntheir secret plans to us. Wot did they bring the rifle aboard for?\nWot\u2019s to prove we ain\u2019t shipmates with a howlin\u2019 bunch of anarchists?\nThey\u2019re quiet now. Them twa in the stokehold only look at me and chew\non their beards when Ah give orders. They\u2019re waitin\u2019 for somethin\u2019!\u201d\n\nMicky strode across the bridge. He gazed sadly at the ripples that\ncurved from the _Shongpong\u2019s_ straight bow. He estimated the speed of\nthe ship to be not more than seven knots an hour. There was no\nbridge-rail log.\n\nHe came back to Mike Monkey and Red Landyard.\n\n\u201cBriefly stated,\u201d ye said, \u201cwe\u2019re in the \u2019ands of Providence.\nAnything is likely to \u2019appen with all that talking fore and aft. The\ncourse the grand juke gave me is to the Pacific--by the nearest\nstrait. I\u2019m \u2019olding that course. That\u2019s all I know. I \u2019ave a wife and\nchildren at \u2019ome. I was thinkin\u2019 of them when I took the contract to\nwork this ship to Victoria.\u201d\n\nMike studied the little skipper\u2019s dungaree jacket and unshaven face.\n\n\u201cHow many Russians are there aboard?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cSixty or seventy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen Ah resign if it comes to blows. Ah am weak from starving on the\nbeach of Novgorod. All Ah have been able to find to eat on this\nhooker is caviar and salt fish. Ah would as soon eat clinkers.\u201d\n\nA door slid open aft. A rolling voice struck forward. Ivan appeared,\nfollowed by two Russians. They were wrapped to the beards in great\ncoats trimmed with fur. They climbed the bridge-ladder and stared at\nthe binnacle.\n\n\u201cEast she is,\u201d said Micky. \u201cEast, a quarter point north.\u201d\n\nIvan swept the sea with a long glance. He nodded and pointed over the\nfreighter\u2019s stumpy jib-boom.\n\n\u201cJapan lays there?\u201d he questioned Micky.\n\n\u201cYes. Habout four \u2019undred miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you sighted any ships?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone, yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do call me on deck. Answer no signals. Keep the Chinese flag\nflying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Union Jack would look better!\u201d\n\nIvan stroked his beard.\n\n\u201cYou take my orders,\u201d he said icily. \u201cAvoid any suggestions. Keep\naway from smoke, sails and particularly gunboats of foreign powers.\nI\u2019ll double the thousand rubles which I have agreed to give you three\nofficers. I\u2019ll increase it to two thousand rubles a week.\u201d\n\nMike gulped and drew his scrawny neck deep into his collar. He waited\nuntil Ivan and the Russians had descended the bridge-ladder and\nwalked slowly aft to where the light streamed from the open cabin\ndoor.\n\n\u201cYe heard that!\u201d grated the engineer with scorn. \u201cAh thought it was\npossible to get a thousand rubles a week. Ah expect nothing now. It\u2019s\ntoo good to be true. Ah minds the likes o\u2019 that Russian! It was in\nGuatemala where I was paid three thousand pesos a month. The pesos\nwere worth sixpence on the pound.\u201d\n\nMicky McMasters shook his head.\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re on the first leg \u2019ome to blighty. We\u2019re\ngettin\u2019 a free passage. That\u2019s something!\u201d\n\nMike Monkey went below to the clanking engines. Red Landyard stared\nforward and aft. He entered the chart-house and turned in across the\nsingle seaweed mattress it contained.\n\nMicky stood the watch until midnight. He woke the Yankee mate, gave\nthe course and dropped down into the engine-room. He sat with Mike\nuntil two bells. The Scotch-Irish engineer was bitter against the\nRussians. He rose now and then and peered through the stokehold door,\nwhere a lurid light glowed.\n\n\u201cTwa stokers,\u201d he said, \u201cand no fire to speak of.\u201d\n\nMicky glanced around in caution as the engineer came back for the\nthird time.\n\n\u201cInvestigate the forehold,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFind out what is in those\ntea boxes. Don\u2019t let anybody see you doing it. There\u2019s a plot of some\nkind aboard this ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve talked enough for a revolution.\u201d\n\nThe little skipper paused on the first round of the engine-room\ngrating.\n\n\u201cGet forrard when you can,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOpen one of those boxes.\u201d\n\nMike gulped and nodded. He drowsed out the morning hours and climbed\nto the deck at the first crack of dawn. He waited all the day for a\nchance to creep through the stokehold without being detected by the\ntwo Russian stokers. A second night came and after night the\ntwinkling lights of the Inland Sea. No chance afforded itself in the\npassage between the Japanese Islands.\n\nIt was morning of the third day when Ivan with the long surname\ndashed thoughts of a discovery in the forehold by summoning all hands\nto the waist of the _Shongpong_.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nA wild seascape greeted Mike\u2019s eyes as he hurried up the engine-room\nladder and braced his spindle legs athwart the planks.\n\nThe dusky outlines of the Japanese Coast were fast fading in the\nwest. The wind swung out of a biting north. The sea had been stirred\nby the tail of a storm. The dingy freighter, with her tipsy funnel\nand standing rigging, rolled and tossed. She threatened to have the\ntwo masts out of her at any moment.\n\nMicky McMasters stood the bridge with Red Landyard. Ivan and all of\nthe Russians, including the crowd from the forecastle, were gathered\nbeneath the shelter of the quarter-deck\u2019s lift. They glanced at Mike\nMonkey and started chattering in Russian. His eyes lifted over their\nheads. He gulped and moved his Adam\u2019s apple up and down his scrawny\nthroat. He spat to the deck.\n\nThe Chinese flag which had been flying from the jack staff had been\nreplaced by a red oblong. It showed baleful in the rays of the sun.\n\nMike turned his chin. He looked at Micky. The little skipper\u2019s jaw\nwas square set. His shoulders were thrown back. There was a fighting\nfire in his eyes.\n\n\u201cWot happened?\u201d asked Mike shrilly.\n\n\u201cOur friends are in charge of the ship,\u201d said Micky over the\nbridge-rail. \u201cCome up \u2019ere! They\u2019re going to take a vote for captain,\nmate and engineer. They say all things in their government should be\nsettled by a vote. They\u2019re going to elect a citizen captain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWot is their government?\u201d\n\nMicky gripped the rail.\n\n\u201cBolshevik!\u201d he snapped.\n\nMike steadied himself on the wet planks. He spat to the deck for a\nsecond time. His glance ranged from the little skipper to Ivan\u2019s\nbroad face.\n\n\u201cAh thought so!\u201d he rasped. \u201cWe\u2019re deluded men!\u201d\n\nIvan strode from the press of Russians beneath the break of the\nquarter-deck. He mounted the main-hatch. His voice rose and fell with\nthe whine of the north wind. He spoke in gusty torrents. He pointed\nto the red flag aft. He turned and leveled an accusing finger at the\nbridge where Red Landyard and Micky stood with folded arms.\n\nMike squinted at the half-circle of Russians. They were being worked\nup to a storm by their leader. A fur cap was passed. Into this was\ndropped slips of paper upon which were scrawled names. A rifle\u2019s\nbayonet lifted above the heads of the Bolsheviki. A club swung.\n\nMike leaped for the bridge-ladder and climbed to the bridge like a\nfrightened ape. He worked his lashless brows up and down. He spat\nthrough yellow teeth:\n\n\u201cWot\u2019s the answer? Wot happened?\u201d\n\nMicky McMasters sighed. He thrust his hands in his pockets\nresignedly.\n\n\u201cHit\u2019s hall hup!\u201d he declared. \u201cThey\u2019re electing a citizen captain to\ntake my place. They\u2019re voting for an engineer and mate. They say\nthere should be equality on the sea as well as on the land. \u2019Ere\ncomes hour substitutes!\u201d\n\nMike glared at three Russians who had detached themselves from the\nothers. One was a former coal-passer. Another had come aft from the\nforecastle. Ivan made the third.\n\nThe Russian stood beneath the rocking bridge and said sternly:\n\n\u201cYou mutineers get below to the stokehold. We will guide the\n_Shongpong_ out across the Pacific. We will make our own report\nwithout your aid. We need you on deck no longer.\u201d\n\nRed Landyard snatched up a belaying pin from the lee rail.\n\n\u201c---- you!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI signed on as mate--and I\u2019ll be mate!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m captain!\u201d shrieked Micky.\n\nThe fight which followed was all one-sided. A hoarse command from\nIvan was answered by a determined rush forward. The Bolshevik horde\nswarmed over the bridge of the wallowing freighter. Micky and Red\nLandyard fought them tooth and nail. They swung belaying-pins and a\nchart-case. They finished their end of the struggle upon their\nknees--to which position they were beaten by the press of numbers.\n\nMike, considering discretion the better part of valor, managed to\ncreep along the weather rail and spring for the engine-room\ncompanion. He sprawled down the ladder head foremost. He rebounded at\nthe grating. He snatched up a spanner and glared upward. He braced a\nfoot in the pit, out of which flashed the slow-moving cranks of the\ncross-compound engines.\n\nHis chin described a quarter-circle. The companion-way was darkened\nby the form of a man. Micky, still fighting, dropped down and struck\nthe grating. Red Landyard was hurled after the little skipper. Both\nseamen had been shorn of most of their clothes. Their faces were\nbleeding. Welts showed upon their shoulders.\n\n\u201cGorblyme!\u201d cried Micky. \u201cGorblyme--give me a hose! Give me hot\nwater! Give me steam!\u201d\n\n\u201cGo easy,\u201d drawled the Yankee mate, squinting at the whiskered faces\nwhich blocked the entire companion. \u201cThere\u2019s a few of them left. We\ndidn\u2019t kill them all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ought to!\u201d spat Micky. \u201cBolsheviki? They\u2019re red-\u2019anded\nmurderers--that\u2019s wot they are!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my opinion,\u201d said Mike Monkey.\n\n\u201cYou? You!\u201d sputtered Micky. \u201cWhere were you when the fight started?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh came down here for a pinch bar. Ah was just going up when ye\njoined me--precipitously.\u201d\n\nMicky rubbed his bleeding knuckles. He turned a cold shoulder upon\nthe engineer, then stared upward. He made faces at the Bolsheviki and\nshook his broken right fist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll \u2019ave you know there\u2019s a law on the seas!\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019ll\nreport this outrage to the next British consul.\u201d\n\nIvan pushed away the men about the companion. He descended two rungs\nof the iron ladder, turned and sneered into the gloom of the\nengine-room.\n\n\u201cYou are to remain below,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cGet steam up and give us\nfull speed. You will be thrown overboard if you do not obey my\norders. The citizen captain so directs me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s me twa thousand rubles?\u201d shouted Mike Monkey. \u201cCoom down\nhere --ye scum of the steepies! Coom down!\u201d\n\nIvan started descending. He thought better of the action when Mike\nsnatched up an iron bar and brandished it with agility.\n\n\u201cCoom down, ye Bolshevik dog! Coom down if ye dare!\u201d\n\nIvan called in Russian. A ferocious face appeared over the edge of\nthe companion. The sharp point of a bayonet extended into plain view.\nThe muzzle of the rifle deflected until it was directly aimed at\nMike. He dropped the iron bar to the grating.\n\nHe held up his hands.\n\n\u201cThat let\u2019s me out!\u201d he cried through chattering teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t\nshoot!\u201d\n\n\u201cGo forward,\u201d Ivan ordered. \u201cYou and the American go forward and put\ncoal on the fires. You, McMasters, attend to the engines. None of you\nthree men will be allowed on deck. You will all be shot if you do not\nkeep the ship moving at full speed. Those are the orders of the\ncitizen captain.\u201d\n\nMicky picked up an oil can. He squirted a stream at the nearest\ncrank.\n\n\u201cSteam on the engine!\u201d he said to Mike and Red.\n\nThe two castaways went through the stokehold doorway. The shovels\ngrated on the iron apron before the double fire-boxes. A biting\nScotch oath rolled into the engine-room. Micky eyed the steam-gage on\nthe main steam pipe. It was climbing. He glanced upward. The\nferocious Russian was standing guard with the rifle. Ivan had\ndisappeared.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nDays passed in unending drudgery. Food was lowered down at the end of\na line. The sentry was changed each watch. Ivan kept away from the\ncompanion, though his voice was heard in loud argument concerning the\nposition of the freighter. Micky, stripped to his sweating waist and\nsmarting from the blows he had received, grinned through the\nknuckle-thick bristle on his lips.\n\nHe kept the engines oiled. He saw to it that the throttle-wheel was\nwide open. Once he relieved Mike at passing coal. The ship made\nprogress of a kind. It was evident that the citizen captain had\nheaded for the center of the north Pacific. There was little danger\nof a lee shore.\n\n\u201cAnd may he wander like the Flyin\u2019 Dutchman!\u201d said Mike Monkey on the\nsixteenth day. \u201cAh hope he\u2019s lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Red Landyard, \u201che\u2019s heading somewhere. The course is\nalways east. I can tell by the sun. He hasn\u2019t changed a quarter\npoint.\u201d\n\nMicky McMasters glared at his two mates. They resembled stokers of\nHades. Their skin was blistered. The callouses on their hands had\nbecome small cushions. The fighting fire in their eyes alone remained\nto remind the little cockney skipper what manner of men they were and\nhad been.\n\n\u201cThe plot,\u201d said Micky, \u201cis thick and \u2019ard to fathom. For why are\nthey \u2019eadin\u2019 to the States or Canada? No one wants them over there.\nThey\u2019ll run their bloody \u2019eads hinto a noose.\u201d\n\nMike Monkey cocked a grease-lined ear. He blinked.\n\n\u201cYe hear them chatterin\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey\u2019re sea lawyers! Ah hae\nhopes they start to massacre themselves.\u201d\n\nMicky rubbed the bristles on his chin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll reach land in a day or two,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll find out the\nanswer for the boxes of tea and the voyage and the other questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cTay!\u201d exclaimed Mike. \u201cYe always said it was tay. This looks like a\ntay party. It--it----\u201d\n\nThe Scotch-Irish engineer\u2019s statement was broken by the appearance of\nIvan\u2019s bulky form in the companion. The Russian came down to the\ngrating. The sentry pointed the rifle at the group. Mike dodged\nbeneath the forward bulkhead door and waited there with bent head.\n\n\u201cMcMasters!\u201d called Ivan. \u201cCome here, McMasters!\u201d\n\nMicky folded his arms across his hairy breast and stared at the\nRussian.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you want?\u201d he asked.\n\nIvan peered through the engine-room gloom.\n\n\u201cWe have decided,\u201d he said heavily, \u201cthat you can join us as a\nbrother. We have voted on it. We will make you rich. You can be one\nof us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be a dirty stoker than one of your breed!\u201d replied Micky.\n\n\u201cWe are going to give you a chance. You can help us navigate to our\nport of call. The citizen captain is not sure of his exact position.\nAssist us to obtain a reading and we will honor you by admission to\nthe Benevolent Order of Reds. We intend to raise one billion dollars\nin Canada and the United States. We shall give you a share in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo ---- with you and your billion!\u201d\n\nMicky screamed, brandishing a broken fist. \u201cGet hout of the gangway!\u201d\n\n\u201cYe did right,\u201d whispered Mike as Ivan climbed hurriedly through the\nengine-room companion and disappeared on deck. \u201cYe were not to be\nbribed by the scum o\u2019 Russia. Wot\u2019s the answer to the billion\ndollars?\u201d\n\nMicky stared at the point of the bayonet which crossed the sky over\nhis head. He glanced at the flashing cranks of the cross-compound\nengines. He raised his voice above the noise of their wallowing\npassage.\n\n\u201cThe answer is this!\u201d he snapped. \u201cThey\u2019re going to Victoria and\nCanada to raise a revolution. There are a lot of Bolsheviki in\n\u2019iding--from Victoria to the Atlantic seaboard. This is a plot to\nstart somethin\u2019 against law and order. I\u2019ll smash that big grand juke\nwith a \u2019ammer the next time \u2019e talks to me. \u2018E\u2019s insulted a British\nseaman--\u2019e \u2019as!\u201d\n\nMike shot a crafty glance at the stokehold door. He scratched his\ngreasy neck.\n\n\u201cA plot?\u201d he said. \u201cAh hae noo doot we can nip it in the bud. All we\ngot to do is to open the bilge-cocks and drown the rats.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we go down with them?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d\n\nMicky shook his head.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not martyrs,\u201d he suggested cuttingly. \u201cThere may be a better\nway to get rid of the scum of Siberia.\u201d\n\n\u201cSet the hooker on fire?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll roast with it!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u2019ll think it over, then.\u201d\n\nMike Monkey disappeared through the bulkhead door. Micky watched the\nengines for a long minute. He raised his eyes and saw a shadow cross\nthe companion opening. A second bayonet joined the first. Ivan had\nposted two guards to watch the three men between decks. The big\nRussian also signaled for more speed. He was answered by oaths from\nMike Monkey and Red Landyard.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nA long, hot day passed. The heat of the stokehold and engine-room was\na thing to remember.\n\nThe three castaways sweated beneath the menace of the two bayonets\nand Ivan\u2019s brutal oaths. The sounds from the deck were those of a\nmadhouse. It was evident that the citizen captain did not know his\nposition on the ocean. Once the _Shongpong_ headed due south. Her\ncourse was changed to northeast. She steadied and clamped onward,\nholding an uncertain path.\n\nNight brought some relief from the heat. The Japan current was\nswinging along the American shore. A breeze sprang up. The ship\nrolled. Lurid oaths from the Russians came down the rusty\nventilators. This was music to the castaways\u2019 ears.\n\nMidnight and eight bells brought diversion. Running feet sounded on\nthe ship\u2019s planks. A muffled cannon-shot echoed from the distance. A\nshell burst over the freighter\u2019s rigging.\n\nClanging bells for more speed drove Micky from the engine-room into\nthe stokehold.\n\n\u201cA gunboat!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWe\u2019re being chased!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh thought we would be!\u201d rasped Mike Monkey. \u201cShall Ah draw the\nfires?\u201d\n\nThe engineer\u2019s question was answered by a curdling oath from Ivan.\nThe leader of the Bolsheviki descended to the stokehold door. He\npeered through the gloom.\n\n\u201cYou heard the bells!\u201d he snarled through his beard. \u201cYou all die if\nyou don\u2019t keep up steam. We\u2019re going to escape from the cutter.\nFortunately it is an old one.\u201d\n\nMicky McMasters shook his head toward his two mates. He followed the\nRussian into the engine-room and picked up an oil can as Ivan\nmotioned for the sentries to get on deck. A silence fell upon the\nbrooding ocean.\n\nRed Landyard appeared between the stokehold and the engine-room. He\nbraced his legs and toyed with a short iron bar. Now and then he\nstared forward to where the crimson light glowed from the fire doors.\nThe steam mounted in the gages. Mike Monkey worked alone. The\nScotch-Irish engineer had evolved an idea out of the situation. He\nhad sent Red to the stokehold door in order to stand guard.\n\n\u201cWhat is \u2019e doing?\u201d asked Micky in a whisper.\n\n\u201c_Sist!_\u201d said the Yankee. \u201cPretend to oil the engines and keep busy.\nDon\u2019t let the sentries suspect anything. Watch the steam. It\u2019s going\nup to the bursting point.\u201d\n\nMicky watched the gage on the main steam leader. It started climbing\nfrom one hundred and seventy to one hundred and ninety. It went over\nthe two hundred mark. It dropped and mounted again.\n\nThe little cockney skipper heard the fire doors clanging. A baleful\nlight streamed past Red Landyard. A roar sounded in the single\nfunnel. It was as if the ship were equipped with a double-fan forced\ndraft. The cross-compound engine spun like a turbine.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2019e putting on the fires?\u201d questioned Micky.\n\n\u201cThe tea!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe boxes of tea in the forehold,\u201d husked Red. \u201cWe broke through and\nlooked the Bolshevik cargo over. It\u2019s combustible all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cTNT?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope! Look out! That sentry is cocking his gun. Duck aft. Don\u2019t let\nhim see you talking with me.\u201d\n\nMicky crawled down the narrow shaft-alley. He sat on the thrust block\nand searched his heated brain for an answer to Mike\u2019s energy. Hours\nlater he heard the scraping of rocks and shale under the\n_Shongpong\u2019s_ keel. The ship heeled and plunged on. Her bow crashed\nupon a shelving beach. The Bolsheviki cursed. A mast went by the\nboard. It splintered the deck. The funnel fell with its load of soot.\nThe engine-room filled with choking smoke.\n\nMike Monkey burst through this pall. He started mounting the ladder\nto the companion. Red and Micky followed the engineer. They stood on\ndeck and ranged their smarting eyes over a desperate scene.\n\nThe citizen captain of the _Shongpong_ had found his port of call--a\nwooded cove on Vancouver Island. In his zeal at the discovery of the\nrendezvous he had neglected to stop the ship. The freighter lay with\na seven-degree list to starboard. Her deck was a mass of wreckage\nfrom fallen standing rigging, mast and funnel. Above this melee of\ntwisted lines and back-stays and smoking ventilators, towered Ivan of\nthe long surname, his great spade-shaped beard lifted on high.\n\nHis followers swarmed around him on the tottering bridge. A red light\nshowed through the tall stems of fir-trees. This fight moved as a\nsignal. A score of furtive shadows flitted in the underbrush at the\nhead of the cove. Russian faces stared out over the shoal waters of\nthe rendezvous. A shout of brotherhood passed between ship and shore.\n\n\u201cLoom on,\u201d whispered Mike Monkey to Micky and the Yankee seaman.\n\u201cLoom aft. They\u2019re too busy forrard to notice us. We\u2019ll lower the\ndingey and escape.\u201d\n\nThe cockney skipper climbed over the deserted quarter-deck and\nloosened the falls. He dropped the bow of the small boat into the\nwaves that curled astern of the grounded freighter. Red Landyard\nlowered the after part of the dingey. The three castaways found oars.\nThey rowed for a dark cape that struck out into the cove. They gained\nthe beach of this point and staggered ashore. They turned and stared\nat the canted freighter.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d said Mike Monkey. \u201cThey\u2019re opening the forehold. Ah wish them\nluck in wot they find beneath the hatch.\u201d\n\nMicky squinted through the gloom. He discerned dancing figures on the\ndeck of the _Shongpong_. A bloodthirsty yell of baffled rage rose to\nthe western stars. It was echoed by the conspirators ashore.\n\n\u201cAh hae noo doot,\u201d Mike Monkey rasped, \u201cthey found ah had burned all\nthe tay. Didn\u2019t Old Whiskers ask us to keep the fires burning hot and\nnice? Ah kept them burning--at a price. Ah put all of the tay boxes\nthrough the fire doors. There\u2019s none left.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was in them?\u201d asked Micky.\n\nMike closed a lashless eyelid. He drew a greasy handful of papers\nfrom beneath his shirt. He offered them to the little skipper.\n\n\u201cRubles!\u201d he said. \u201cBolshevik bonds and rubles! They were bringing\nthem to Canada and the States. Ah hae an idea they were going to sell\nthem to the Reds in both countries. All ah know to be sure is--there\nain\u2019t no rubles left. Ah found them better to burn than the miserable\nslag called Japanese coal.\u201d\n\nMicky saw a light. He squareset his unshaven chin and pointed south\nalong the coast.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll walk the beach,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil we come to a coast guard. No\ndoubt the cutter that chased the Bolsheviki is nosin\u2019 around. We\u2019ll\nshow it where to go.\u201d\n\nMike thrust his ruble notes back within his shirt.\n\n\u201cAh\u2019ll keep these!\u201d he declared. \u201cThey ain\u2019t worth a ha\u2019penny, but\nthey\u2019re what we can expect to get for wages if the Reds start runnin\u2019\nthe governments.\u201d\n\n\nTHE END",
