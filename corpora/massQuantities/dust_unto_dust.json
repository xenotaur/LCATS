    "body": "Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\n\nHe saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n\nHe frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n\nWass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n\nMartin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city--even a city like this one--in such surroundings.\n\nThe men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet--the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n\n\"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n\nMartin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n\nRodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\n\nWass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n\nThree feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n\nWass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n\nMartin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\n\nRodney nodded.\n\nAfter a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\n\nMartin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis--was--for.\"\n\n\"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n\n\"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\n\nThe three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n\nRodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not--not very big. Is it?\"\n\nWass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the--well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n\nRodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering--\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n\nA nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out--and the image\nfaded.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen--\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n\n\"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\n\nRodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n\n\"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n\nHe straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n\n\"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n\n\"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\n\nThe blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively--\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\n\nMartin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\n\nWass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n\nAgain Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n\nParallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n\nRodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nThe bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw--I thought I\nsaw--something--moving--\"\n\nAnger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!\"\n\nRodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n\n\"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\n\nRodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That--\"\n\n\"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\"\n\n\n\nRodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up.\n\nWass said, more quietly, \"Remember that metal band? It's all clear now,\nand glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a\nglass wall.\"\n\n\"We're trapped, we're trapped, they are--\"\n\n\"Shut up, Rodney! Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge. I'll check\nhere.\"\n\nMartin clapped a hand on Rodney's shoulder again, starting him moving,\ntoward the city's edge, past the black, silent buildings.\n\nThe glittering band was here, too, like a halo around a silhouette.\n\n\"No go,\" Martin said to Wass. He bit at his lower lip. \"I think it must\nbe all around us.\" He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences\nof this. Then--\"We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we\nseparated.\"\n\nWalking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic\nthrough the radio receiver against his ear. \"What do you suppose caused\nthis?\"\n\nHe shook his head angrily, saying, \"Judging by reports of the rest of\nthe planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of\nit.\"\n\n\"Man-made radiation, you mean.\"\n\nMartin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. \"Well,\nalien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war.\"\n\nWass' voice sounded startled. \"Anti-radiation screen?\"\n\nRodney interrupted, \"There hasn't been enough radiation around here for\nhundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.\"\n\nWass said coldly, \"He's right, Martin.\"\n\nMartin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. \"You're\nboth wrong,\" he said. \"We landed here today.\"\n\nRodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at\nMartin. \"The wind--?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then.\" Rodney stood\nstraighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer.\n\nThey reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass,\nand stood watching him labor along the metal toward them.\n\nWass' face, Martin saw, was sober. \"I tried to call the ship. No luck.\"\n\n\"The shield?\"\n\nWass nodded. \"What else?\"\n\n\"I don't know--\"\n\n\"If we went to the roof of the tallest building,\" Rodney offered, \"we\nmight--\"\n\nMartin shook his head. \"No. To be effective, the shield would have to\ncover the city.\"\n\nWass stared down at the metal street, as if he could look through it.\n\"I wonder where it gets its power?\"\n\n\"Down below, probably. If there is a down below.\" Martin hesitated. \"We\nmay have to....\"\n\n\"What?\" Rodney prompted.\n\nMartin shrugged. \"Let's look.\"\n\nHe led the way through a shoulder-high arch in one of the tall\nbuildings surrounding the square. The corridor inside was dim and\nplain, and he switched on his flashlight, the other two immediately\nfollowing his example. The walls and the rounded ceiling of the\ncorridor were of the same dull metal as the buildings' facades, and\nthe streets. There were a multitude of doors and arches set into\neither side of the corridor.\n\nIt was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive.\n\nMartin chose an arch, with beyond it a metal ramp, which tilted\ndownward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch.\n\nA call from Rodney halted him. \"Back here,\" the tall man repeated. \"It\nlooks like a switchboard.\"\n\nThe three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a\ngreat arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had\ncome to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining\nthrough the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick\nrope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal\nroof.\n\n\"Is this it,\" Wass murmured, \"or an auxiliary?\"\n\nMartin shrugged. \"The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently.\"\n\n\"Another assumption,\" Wass said. \"We have done nothing but make\nassumptions ever since we got here.\"\n\n\"What would you suggest, instead?\" Martin asked calmly.\n\nRodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch.\n\n\"No!\" Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make.\n\nRodney turned. \"But--\"\n\n\"No. Wass, how much time have we?\"\n\n\"The ship leaves in eleven hours.\"\n\n\"Eleven hours,\" Rodney repeated. \"Eleven hours!\" He reached out for the\nswitch again. Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly.\n\nHe directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. \"What do you\nthink you're doing?\"\n\n\"We have to find out what all this stuff's for!\"\n\n\"Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves.\"\n\n\"We've got to--\"\n\n\"No!\" Then, more quietly--\"We still have eleven hours to find a way\nout.\"\n\n\"Ten hours and forty-five minutes,\" Wass disagreed softly. \"Minus the\ntime it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow\nit, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet.\nAnd Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin.\"\n\n\"You too, Wass?\"\n\n\"Up to the point of accuracy, yes.\"\n\nMartin said, \"Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always\nthinking of your own tender hide, of course.\"\n\nRodney cursed. \"And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us\nthat much less time to find a way out. Martin--\"\n\n\"Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you\nstand!\"\n\n\n\nWass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. \"We all\nhave guns, Martin.\"\n\n\"I'm holding mine.\" Martin waited.\n\nAfter a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly,\n\"He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here.\"\n\n\"Well....\" Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. \"Let's get out\nof here, then!\"\n\nMartin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down the\nmetal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called a\nhalt. \"If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must\nbe at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city.\"\n\nRodney said, \"To search every building next to the dome clean around\nthe city would take years.\"\n\nMartin nodded. \"But there must be central roads beneath this main level\nleading to them. Up here there are too many roads.\"\n\nWass laughed rudely.\n\n\"Have you a better idea?\"\n\nWass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, \"That\nleads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible for\nthe dome, does it project down into the ground as well?\"\n\n\"You mean _dig_ out?\" Martin asked.\n\n\"Sure. Why not?\"\n\n\"We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have no\nequipment.\"\n\n\"That shouldn't be hard to come by.\"\n\nMartin smiled, banishing Wass' idea.\n\nRodney said, \"They may have had their digging equipment built right in\nto themselves.\"\n\n\"Anyway,\" Martin decided, \"we can take a look down below.\"\n\n\"In the pitch dark,\" Wass added.\n\nMartin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp.\nThe incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feet\nperhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort,\ngleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of the\ndarkness before the men.\n\nAt length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city.\n\nMartin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example.\nMetal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone down\non them.\n\nWass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly in\na circle. \"No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that up\nthere?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I have no idea.\" Martin gestured toward the ramp with\nhis light. \"Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar to\nyou?\"\n\nRodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers. \"Here?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Martin answered impatiently, \"not just here. I mean the whole\ncity.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Wass said dryly, \"it does. I'm sure this is where all my\nnightmares stay when they're not on shift.\"\n\nMartin turned on his heel and started down a metal avenue which, he\nthought, paralleled the street above. And Rodney and Wass followed him\nsilently. They moved along the metal, past unfamiliar shapes made more\nso by gloom and moving shadows, past doors dancing grotesquely in the\nthree lights, past openings in the occasional high metal partitions,\npast something which was perhaps a conveyor belt, past another\nsomething which could have been anything at all.\n\nThe metal street ended eventually in a blank metal wall.\n\nThe edge of the city--the city which was a dome of force above and a\nbowl of metal below.\n\nAfter a long time, Wass sighed. \"Well, skipper...?\"\n\n\"We go back, I guess,\" Martin said.\n\nRodney turned swiftly to face him. Martin thought the tall man was\nholding his gun. \"To the switchboard, Martin?\"\n\n\"Unless someone has a better idea,\" Martin conceded. He waited. But\nRodney was holding the gun ... and Wass was.... Then--\"I can't think of\nanything else.\"\n\nThey began to retrace their steps along the metal street, back past\nthe same dancing shapes of metal, the partitions, the odd windows, all\nlooking different now in the new angles of illumination.\n\nMartin was in the lead. Wass followed him silently. Rodney, tall,\nmatchstick thin, even in his cumbersome suit, swayed with jaunty\ntriumph in the rear.\n\nMartin looked at the metal street lined with its metal objects and he\nsighed. He remembered how the dark buildings of the city looked at\nsurface level, how the city itself looked when they were landing, and\nthen when they were walking toward it. The dream was gone again for\nnow. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn.\nBut--The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'd\never explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, and\nMartin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who at\nsome point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by a\nsort of racial insanity.\n\nNo, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be.\nViewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity,\na faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alien\nmetal, which was making him theorize so wildly.\n\nThen Wass touched his elbow. \"Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp.\"\n\nLight from their torches was reflected, as from glass.\n\n\"All right,\" Rodney said belligerently into his radio. \"What's holding\nup the procession?\"\n\nMartin was silent.\n\nWass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. It\nwas in Wass' own interest. In a moment, all three were standing before\na bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far as\nthe combined light of their torches would reach.\n\n\"Seeds!\" Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass.\n\nMartin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips.\n\nWass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section\nof the bank.\n\nMartin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city. If they\nwouldn't grow there.... Or had they, once? \"Don't, Wass!\"\n\nTorchlight reflected from Wass' faceplate as he turned his head. \"Why\nnot?\"\n\nThey were like children.... \"We don't know, released, what they'll do.\"\n\n\"Skipper,\" Wass said carefully, \"if we don't get out of this place by\nthe deadline we may be eating these.\"\n\nMartin raised his arm tensely. \"Opening a seed bank doesn't help us\nfind a way out of here.\" He started up the ramp. \"Besides, we've no\nwater.\"\n\nRodney came last up the ramp, less jaunty now, but still holding the\ngun. His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. \"For\na plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water.\nMaybe--\" he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing with\nsuper-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits \"--only the\nlittle moisture in the atmosphere.\"\n\n\n\nThey stood before the switchboard again. Martin and Wass side by side,\nRodney, still holding his gun, slightly to the rear.\n\nRodney moved forward a little toward the switches. His breathing was\nloud and rather uneven in the radio receivers.\n\nMartin made a final effort. \"Rodney, it's still almost nine hours to\ntake off. Let's search awhile first. Let this be a last resort.\"\n\nRodney jerked his head negatively. \"No. Now, I know you, Martin.\nPostpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves without\nus and we're stranded here to eat seeds and gradually dehydrate\nourselves and God only knows what else and--\"\n\nHe reached out convulsively and yanked a switch.\n\nMartin leaped, knocking him to the floor. Rodney's gun skittered away\nsilently, like a live thing, out of the range of the torches.\n\nThe radio receivers impersonally recorded the grating sounds of\nRodney's sobs.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Martin said, without feeling. He turned quickly. \"Wass?\"\n\nThe slight, blond man stood unmoving. \"I'm with you, Martin, but, as\na last resort it might be better to be blown sky high than to die\ngradually--\"\n\nMartin was watching Rodney, struggling to get up. \"I agree. As a last\nresort. We still have a little time.\"\n\nRodney's tall, spare figure looked bowed and tired in the torchlight,\nnow that he was up again. \"Martin, I--\"\n\nMartin turned his back. \"Skip it, Rodney,\" he said gently.\n\n\"Water,\" Wass said thoughtfully. \"There must be reservoirs under this\ncity somewhere.\"\n\nRodney said, \"How does water help us get out?\"\n\nMartin glanced at Wass, then started out of the switchboard room, not\nlooking back. \"It got in and out of the city some way. Perhaps we can\nleave the same way.\"\n\nDown the ramp again.\n\n\"There's another ramp,\" Wass murmured.\n\nRodney looked down it. \"I wonder how many there are, all told.\"\n\nMartin placed one foot on the metal incline. He angled his torch down,\npicking out shadowy, geometrical shapes, duplicates of the ones on the\npresent level. \"We'll find out,\" he said, \"how many there are.\"\n\nEleven levels later Rodney asked, \"How much time have we now?\"\n\n\"Seven hours,\" Wass said quietly, \"until take-off.\"\n\n\"One more level,\" Martin said, ignoring the reference to time. \"I ...\nthink it's the last.\"\n\nThey walked down the ramp and stood together, silent in a dim pool of\nartificial light on the bottom level of the alien city.\n\nRodney played his torch about the metal figures carefully placed about\nthe floor. \"Martin, what if there are no reservoirs? What if there are\ncemeteries instead? Or cold storage units? Maybe the switch I pulled--\"\n\n\"Rodney! Stop it!\"\n\nRodney swallowed audibly. \"This place scares me....\"\n\n\"The first time I was ever in a rocket, it scared me. I was thirteen.\"\n\n\"This is different,\" Wass said. \"Built-in traps--\"\n\n\"They had a war,\" Martin said.\n\nWass agreed. \"And the survivors retired here. Why?\"\n\nMartin said, \"They wanted to rebuild. Or maybe this was already built\nbefore the war as a retreat.\" He turned impatiently. \"How should I\nknow?\"\n\nWass turned, too, persistent. \"But the planet was through with them.\"\n\n\"In a minute,\" Martin said, too irritably, \"we'll have a sentient\nplanet.\" From the corner of his eye he saw Rodney start at that. \"Knock\nit off, Wass. We're looking for reservoirs, you know.\"\n\nThey moved slowly down the metal avenue, between the twisted shadow\nshapes, looking carefully about them.\n\nRodney paused. \"We might not recognize one.\"\n\nMartin urged him on. \"You know what a man-hole cover looks like.\" He\nadded dryly, \"Use your imagination.\"\n\nThey reached the metal wall at the end of the avenue and paused again,\nuncertain.\n\nMartin swung his flashlight, illuminating the distorted metal shapes.\n\nWass said, \"All this had a purpose, once....\"\n\n\"We'll disperse and search carefully,\" Martin said.\n\n\"I wonder what the pattern was.\"\n\n\"... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for later\nexpeditions to study. So will we if we don't find a way to get out.\"\n\nTheir radios recorded Rodney's gasp. Then--\"Martin! Martin! I think\nI've found something!\"\n\nMartin began to run. After a moment's hesitation, Wass swung in behind\nhim.\n\n\"Here,\" Rodney said, as they came up to him, out of breath. \"Here. See?\nRight here.\"\n\nThree flashlights centered on a dark, metal disk raised a foot or more\nfrom the floor.\n\n\"Well, they had hands.\" With his torch Wass indicated a small wheel of\nthe same metal as everything else in the city, set beside the disk.\n\nFrom its design Martin assumed that the disk was meant to be grasped\nand turned. He wondered what precisely they were standing over.\n\n\"Well, Skipper, are you going to do the honors?\"\n\nMartin kneeled, grasped the wheel. It turned easily--almost too\neasily--rotating the disk as it turned.\n\nSuddenly, without a sound, the disk rose, like a hatch, on a concealed\nhinge.\n\nThe three men, clad in their suits and helmets, grouped around the\nsix-foot opening, shining their torches down into the thing that\ndrifted and eddied directly beneath them.\n\nRodney's sudden grip on Martin's wrist nearly shattered the bone.\n\"Martin! It's all alive! It's moving!\"\n\nMartin hesitated long enough for a coil to move sinuously up toward the\nopening. Then he spun the wheel and the hatch slammed down.\n\nHe was shaking.\n\n\n\nAfter a time he said, \"Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Remember\nthe wind? Air currents are moving it.\"\n\nRodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing.\nThen--\"It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?\"\n\nMartin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him,\notherwise. He said merely, \"At first I wasn't sure myself.\"\n\nRodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gun\nloosely, and his hand shook. \"Then prove it. Open it again.\"\n\nMartin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodney\nand he, too, had drawn his gun.\n\nThe hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it,\noutlined in the light of two torches.\n\nFor a little while he was alone.\n\nThen--causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney--a\ntenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about\nMartin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight,\nobscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strange\nobjects.\n\nMartin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmering\nspirals.\n\nRodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He said\nnothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, and\nnow, himself.\n\n\"How deep,\" Wass said, from his safe distance.\n\n\"We'll have to lower a flashlight,\" Martin answered.\n\nRodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with a\ntorch swinging wildly on the end of it.\n\nThe torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gently\nrolling mounds of fine, white stuff.\n\nMartin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lip\nof the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. \"You'd rather monkey with the\nswitches and blow yourself to smithereens?\"\n\nWass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at him\ndisgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering into\nthe infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottom\nof the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. He\nstamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standing\njump. He sank no farther than his knees.\n\nHe sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearest\nedge of the city. \"I think we'll be all right,\" he called out, \"as long\nas we avoid the drifts.\"\n\nRodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.\n\n\"All right, Wass,\" Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope and\nsank into the dust.\n\n\"Not me,\" the answer came back quickly. \"You two fools go your way,\nI'll go mine.\"\n\n\"Wass!\"\n\nThere was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.\n\nThe going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddied\nand swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits were\nhard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.\n\n\"Are we going straight?\" Rodney asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" Martin growled.\n\nThere was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.\nThe two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriously\nplunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, times\nwithout number.\n\nThen Wass broke his silence, taunting. \"The ship leaves in two hours,\nMartin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?\"\n\nMartin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in his\nthroat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust,\nhis flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed.\n\nA grate.\n\nRodney stared. \"Wass!\" he shouted. \"We've found a way out!\"\n\nTheir radios recorded Wass' laughter. \"I'm at the switchboard now,\nMartin. I--\"\n\nThere was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.\n\nThe grate groaned upward and stopped.\n\nWass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then he\nbegan to scream.\n\nMartin switched off his radio, sick.\n\nHe turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I've been trying to get you,\" Rodney said, frantically. \"Why didn't\nyou answer?\"\n\n\"We couldn't do anything for him.\"\n\nRodney's face was white and drawn. \"But he did this for us.\"\n\n\"So he did,\" Martin said, very quietly.\n\nRodney said nothing.\n\nThen Martin said, \"Did you listen until the end?\"\n\nRodney nodded, jerkily. \"He pulled three more switches. I couldn't\nunderstand it all. But--Martin, dying alone like that in a place like\nthis--!\"\n\nMartin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted up\ntoward the surface. \"Come on, Rodney. Last lap.\"\n\nAn hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from the\nedge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of force\nshimmering, almost invisible, about it.\n\nAhead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship.\nMartin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew members\nstanding by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to run\ntoward them.\n\n\"Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe,\" someone said. It\nwas the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed.\n\n\n\n\n",
