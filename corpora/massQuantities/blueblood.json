    "body": "Even if I'm only a space pilot, I'm not dumb. I mean I'm not _that_\ndumb. I admit that Dr. Ellik and Dr. Chon outrank me, because that's\nthe way it's got to be. A pilot is only an expendable part. But I had\nbeen the first one to see the natives on this planet, and I was the\nfirst one to point out that they came in two attractive shades of blue,\nlight blue and dark blue.\n\nFour Indigos were carrying an Azure. I called the others over to the\nscreen.\n\n\"A sedan chair,\" identified Lee Chon. \"Think the light-skinned one is a\nkind of a priest?\"\n\nMike Ellik shook his head. \"I doubt it. The chair isn't ornate enough.\nI think that's probably the standard method of travel--at least for a\ncertain social elite.\"\n\n\"Do you notice anything unusual about those bully boys?\"\n\n\"You tell me what you see,\" Ellik evaded.\n\n\"Three of them are mongoloid idiots,\" said Chon.\n\n\"I thought so,\" Ellik said, \"but I wasn't quite sure--aliens and all.\"\n\n\"They're humanoids,\" Chon said, \"and humanoids are my specialty. I\nknow.\"\n\n\"The fourth one doesn't look much better.\"\n\n\"His features are slack and his jaw is loose, all right, but they\naren't _made_ that way. It's an expression he could change. His head\nisn't shaped like that.\"\n\n\"Um. The man in the chair is a striking specimen. No cerebral damage in\nhim.\"\n\n\"I don't think the answer is brain damage. If the 'noble' trusts those\nfour to carry him, their actions and reflexes must be pretty well\ncoordinated. They can't have anything like palsy or epilepsy.\"\n\n\"They must breed a special type of slave for the job,\" Ellik suggested.\n\n\"They aren't slaves, Mike,\" I told him.\n\n\"No?\" Ellik said, like talking to a kid. \"And what are they, Mike?\"\n\n\n\nI breathed out hard, a little disgusted that big brains like Ellik and\nChon couldn't see the translucent truth. \"They are just four dumb slobs\nwho can't get a better job, so they are hauling His Highness around\nbecause they have to make a living the hard way.\"\n\n\"That doesn't quite cover it, Johnny,\" Chon said. \"The carriers are a\ncompletely different race.\"\n\n\"What's different about them?\" I asked. \"They've got hands to work\nwith, eyes to see with, noses to smell with. If you kick one of them, I\nbet he'll hurt. It's just their bad luck to be dumb slobs.\"\n\nEllik grunted. \"Unfortunately, Johnny, there are subtler differences.\nThe darker aliens, the indigo-colored ones, seem to be definitely down\nfurther on the scale of local evolution. They must be an inferior race\nto the lighter, azure species.\"\n\nChon had been looking at us and listening to everything. Finally he\nsaid, \"You can't be sure of that, Mike. You haven't seen all of the\nIndigos. Some of them may not be as far down as the common carriers.\"\n\nEllik sighed. \"Explorers have to make snap decisions on insufficient\ndata. We don't have time to see the whole damned planet before we write\nup a report.\"\n\n\"Yes, explorers have to make snap decisions,\" Chon repeated to himself.\n\"Are you going to take a look at those buildings, see if it's a\nvillage?\"\n\n\"I thought I'd see if our blueblood friend out there wants to show it\nto me,\" said Mike Ellik.\n\n\"He won't,\" I said.\n\nThey both looked at me.\n\n\"You don't have any chair and nobody to carry you,\" I went on. \"He'll\nthink you're just a slob.\"\n\n\"Jonathan,\" Ellik said, \"you show occasional flashes of genius.\"\n\nI smiled and shrugged it off. \"I know I'm not nearly as smart as you\nboys. But that doesn't mean I can't think _at all_.\"\n\nEllik clapped me on the shoulder. \"Of course it doesn't.\"\n\nBut his grip was too strong.\n\n\"Johnny,\" Ellik said gravely, \"do you think _you_ could carry me?\"\n\n\"Wait a minute. You want me to act like one of those slobs? That's\nasking a lot.\"\n\n\"But could you?\"\n\n\"Not all the way to those buildings. What was the gravity reading, Lee?\"\n\n\n\nChon closed his eyes a second. \"Point nine seven three.\"\n\n\"There!\" I said. \"I couldn't tote you three or four miles piggy-back.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Chon said, \"we can strip down a magnetic flyer and you can ride\nthe seat, Mike. Johnny can pretend to carry you, like on a platter.\nIt'll impress the yokels with the strength of our flunkies.\"\n\n\"_Mike_ could carry _me_,\" I pointed out.\n\nChon laid a delicate hand on my back. \"But, buddy, Mike outranks you.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Not that way, he doesn't.\"\n\n\"We may be going to a lot of trouble for nothing,\" Mike said. \"That\ngang may jump us as soon as we decant and try to have us for dinner.\"\n\n\"There's always that risk,\" Chon agreed solemnly, \"but naturally I will\nremain on duty at the controls of the stun cannon.\"\n\n\"Securely inside,\" Ellik added.\n\n\"Always on duty,\" Chon said.\n\n\"Always inside,\" Ellik said.\n\n\"It's in the records, Ellik. I took the last one.\" Lee said it a little\ntoo sharp and it cut the kidding.\n\n\"Go soak your soft head in brine,\" Ellik said, disgruntled.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Chon called.\n\nEllik turned back. \"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Don't forget to take your communicator with you.\" Chon's voice was\nchoked. \"You may get out of line of sight if you go off with that\ntroupe.\"\n\n\"I know this business,\" Ellik said, turning away.\n\n\"Mike, I'm sorry if I offended you. Shake, huh?\"\n\nEllik smiled sourly. \"Forget it.\"\n\n\"Come on, shake.\"\n\n\"Okay, we're buddies. Do I actually have to pump your clammy paw?\"\n\n\"Please!\"\n\n\"Oh, for Pete's sake!\" Ellik turned around and kissed Chon on the\nforehead.\n\nEllik was just sore, of course. But the manual warns against that sort\nof horseplay when you've been out a long time.\n\n\"Satisfied now?\" Ellik asked.\n\n\"No.\" Chon's voice was strained tight. \"It should have been me to kiss\nyou.\" Chon turned to me. \"Luck out there, Johnny.\"\n\nI grabbed his hand and levered it fast, before he could decide I needed\nkissing. \"Sure thing, Lee. Thanks.\"\n\n\n\nThe buildings weren't much to see, but they were a step above primitive\nhuts. They were adobe, or maybe plastic. The aliens understood the\nstress principles of the dome, Ellik said, because all the buildings\nhad curved roofs. Unbaked pottery was what they looked like to me,\nand they looked as if they would be brittle as coffee-colored chalk.\nActually, their ceramic surfaces were at least as hard as steel.\n\nThe Azure had welcomed Ellik with an outstretched hand. Mike wasn't one\nto jump to conclusions, so he just held out his own hand. The native\ngrabbed and let it go after pulling it some.\n\nThe alien saw me apparently carrying Ellik on a seat cushion with one\nhand, and he kicked me in the leg. To test my muscles, I guess. I\nmanaged to keep from yelling or jumping. The Azure looked impressed and\nthe Indigos did a bad job of hiding a lot of envy and hate.\n\nAs the Indigos toted their man along on the litter and I guided Ellik's\nseat cushion along the channel of magnetic feedback, the two riders\nbegan talking. Ellik's translator collar broke the language barrier,\nof course. It was a two-way communicator on a direct hook-up to our\ncybernetic calculator on the ship. The brain analyzed the phonetic\nstructure of the alien language under various systems of logic or\nanti-logic and fed the translation into Ellik's ear. Then it went\nthrough its memory banks and played back the right sounds to translate\nEllik's talk into the alien language. I understand things like that.\nI'm a pretty good mechanic.\n\nI didn't have my translator turned on, but it seemed to me that somehow\nI could understand what the plug-uglies, the Indigos, were saying.\n\nEllik told me that it was because all their speech was based on the\none universal humanoid sound, \"mama.\" Everything good in the way of\nnouns and verbs (there were no other particles of speech) was some\ninflection of \"m-m\" and everything bad was \"uh-m-m.\"\n\nEllik was pretty \"uh-m-m.\"\n\nI was _plenty_ \"uh-m-m.\" I threatened their jobs, they thought.\n\nThey were a real miserable bunch of slobs, those Indigos.\n\nWe passed through the wide places between the houses--I wouldn't call\nthem streets--and saw a lot of Indigos crouched in doorways, watching\nus, and Azures being toted around.\n\nThe clothing they wore was also pretty universal for sentient bipeds--a\ntunic or sarong, kind of. For the Azures, it was smooth and colorful;\nand for the Indigos, a loincloth of some rough, dun-colored stuff.\n\nEllik chinned off his translator switch and leaned down toward my ear.\n\"They are two distinct races, Johnny. Notice that _all_ the Indigos\nare menials. There does not appear to be anything to correspond to a\nfreedman or even a higher-ranked house servant. The Azures treat the\nIndigos only as animals.\"\n\n\"Slobs,\" I said. \"Poor dumb slobs.\"\n\nThe nuclear flash washed over us, peppering us with a few excess\nroentgens.\n\nWe couldn't look at the spaceship going up, but we knew it was going.\nIt was making a dawn.\n\nThe aliens were all frightened. They fell on the ground and started\npraying to the ship, all of them, the Azures and the Indigos.\n\n\"What's wrong with that crazy Chinaman?\" Ellik yelped.\n\n\"Lee knows what he's doing,\" I said.\n\nEllik unsnapped his communicator from his belt. \"Johnny says you know\nwhat you're doing, Chon. _Do you?_\"\n\n\"I know.\" Chon's voice sounded right beside us, perfectly natural. Belt\ncommunicators work just as well as those consoles. People only buy\nconsoles for prestige.\n\n\"Well?\" Ellik demanded. \"What _are_ you doing, Lee?\"\n\nI thought maybe something had gone wrong with the communicator.\n\nChon's voice finally reached us.\n\n\"I'm leaving you and Johnny on this planet, Mike,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAn Indigo brought us in our morning supply of fruit.\n\nEllik kicked the Indigo. \"It's overripe, blockhead. _Amum, amum._\"\n\nThe Indigo backed out, bowing, eyes very round.\n\nEllik felt me looking at him.\n\n\"Well, I don't _like_ kicking the oaf, but that's all he's been\nconditioned to understand as a sign of disapproval.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said.\n\nEllik passed through the scimitar of gray shadow into the sunlight that\nwashed lines and years out of his face. He braced a hand against the\ndoorframe and craned his head back. It stopped and steadied.\n\n\"He's still there,\" Ellik said. \"Sometimes I wish his orbit would decay\nenough to burn him up in this damned sour air.\" He coughed into his\nfist.\n\n\"He could probably correct,\" I suggested.\n\nEllik sneered. \"He hasn't got the brains.\"\n\n\"Pretty hard for one man to manage a takeoff. He was lucky to make it\ninto orbit.\"\n\n\"I just wish he would come down. Somehow, someway, I'd get to him, no\nmatter where he went on this planet.\"\n\n\"I suppose that's why he stays up.\"\n\nEllik slammed his fist into his palm. \"I'm going to call him again. He\ncan't get away without us. If he fouled up a takeoff that badly, he's\nnot going to try to solo into hyperspace.\"\n\n\"I don't think anyone would solo into hyperspace. I don't think he\nwould be able to come back.\"\n\n\"Oh, what do you know about it?\" Ellik said shortly. \"He's just\nbuilding up his courage to try the big jump. He's yellow, sure, but\nsooner or later he'll get desperate enough, or scared enough, to\nactually go. Then we'll be stranded for fair. This planet may not be\ncolonized for centuries!\"\n\n\"Probably never,\" I said. \"Not after Lee's reports.\"\n\n\"You think he would falsify reports?\" Ellik asked, blinking at me.\n\n\"I suppose he'll have to.\"\n\nEllik held his head with his hands. \"Of course, of course. There's no\nlimit to the depths to which he would plummet.\" He ran over to the\ncorner and snatched a communicator off the pile of our gear. \"I'm going\nto call him and tell him what I think of him and his wild obsession.\"\n\nI didn't remind Ellik that he had been telling Chon just that at least\nonce a day for a month. I knew his nerves got tighter and tighter and\ncussing out Chon helped release them and make him feel better.\n\n\"Come down, Lee!\" Ellik called. \"The three of us can make the jump\ntogether. You're martyring yourself for a crazy reason!\"\n\n\"We've talked this over before,\" Chon answered. \"This is the last time\nI'm going to respond to your call. I've made it clear to you that I\nthink knowledge of this world will cause great suffering, a lot of\ndeath, among the majority of Earth's people.\"\n\n\"You're talking prejudice, Lee! _Your_ prejudice. People aren't like\nthat any more.\"\n\n\"We haven't gone _that_ far, Mike. The bigots, the hatemongers, the\npettiness and xenophobia lurking in everybody haven't been asleep\nthat long. Just look at it from _my_ side, Mike. What will the white\npeople of Earth think about the Orientals, Negroes and Indians of\nEarth when they find out the dark-skinned humanoids of another\nplanet are--measurably, unquestionably, vastly--_inferior_ to the\nlight-skinned race of the same world? I ask you, Mike!\"\n\n\n\nMike Ellik said, \"It's an inept analogy, Lee, and you know it.\"\n\n\"But most people reason by analogy,\" said Lee Chon. \"No, Mike. I have\nto leave you and Johnny to prevent a recurrence of racial hatred,\nintolerance and all the ugly consequences on both sides. This is the\nlast time I'll answer you, Mike. I'm getting lonesome. In a few years,\nI'll get hungry for human companionship. I don't want to be tempted\ndown. Good-by, Johnny. So long, Mike.\"\n\nEllik screamed. \"Wait! Answer one more call, Lee. It's the least you\ncan do for me. I don't know when I'll make it. It may be in a few weeks\nor a few years. It won't be just argument, Lee. I'll have something\nyou'll _want_ to tell Earth about this place and these people.\"\n\n\"I'm still here. Tell it to me now,\" Chon's voice said.\n\n\"No. I want to get proof. Let me rig up some kind of video circuit for\nyou. I can use parts out of our tape camera and the translators. I want\nto get it all across to you.\"\n\nI could hear Chon breathing. \"Very well. I'll answer your next call.\"\n\n\"Lee,\" I called out, \"Mike and me will be expecting you to answer.\"\n\nChon laughed. \"I'm not going anywhere, Johnny. Only around this world\nevery couple of hours.\"\n\n\"You couldn't make the jump through hyperspace without us, Lee,\" Ellik\nsaid.\n\n\"That's right, Mike. I'm--I'm sorry to quarantine you two down there.\"\n\n\"_Quarantine!_\" Ellik stormed. \"_We're_ not sick, Lee. _You_ are the\nsick one!\"\n\nThere wasn't any sound, not even of breathing.\n\n\"You have an idea to change Lee's mind, Mike?\" I asked.\n\nHe cupped his hand on the back of my neck. \"Affirmative, Jonathan. A\npretty damned good one, too.\"\n\nEllik stood staring out the door, gnawing on one of his knuckles,\nletting the sun turn the front of him into gold, so he looked like half\na statue, and half a man.\n\n\"I suppose it had to come out in him sooner or later,\" he said.\n\n\"What, Mike?\"\n\n\"What could we expect? It's the basic quality of treachery in the\nOriental mind.\"\n\n\n\nWhen the shadows were at their longest and the alien sun was down the\nclosest to the horizon without actually going under, Ellik marched up\nthe path shoving a new Indigo. The Azures supplied Mike with all the\nflunkies he wanted to gather food and the like for him, as his natural\nright. But I thought we had enough of them hanging around our quarters.\nI couldn't imagine what he would want with another one.\n\nThe alien hovered at the door. Ellik kicked him in the calf to make him\nunderstand he was to go inside.\n\n\"Look at him, Johnny,\" Ellik said, pushing the fellow forward. \"Not a\nmongoloid, would you say?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe alien looked stupid--blue and stupid. His face was hanging there,\nbut it wasn't pushed out of shape any more than the faces of the\nAzures. The Indigo blinked back at me. What he also looked was not\nfriendly.\n\nEllik took the Indigo's cheeks in his hand and angled the face toward\nthe light. \"He's a half-breed, Johnny, or otherwise the gene was\nrecessive. He wasn't damaged before birth, only after--when he started\nto breathe.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Mike?\"\n\n\"You ever hear of cyanosis, Johnny?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, these creatures have something like it. The Indigos don't get\nenough oxygen in their blood cells. It makes them sluggish; it turns\nthem blue like the pictures of 'blue babies' in the old books.\"\n\n\"I never saw a picture like that in an old book,\" I said.\n\n\"Did you ever _see_ a book? Sorry, Johnny. Just kidding.\" Ellik\nrubbed his hands together. \"Well! I theorized that there is no basic\ndifference in the Azures and the Indigos except improper aeration of\ntheir blood. So, you see, an Indigo is only a _sick_ Azure, and I am\ngoing to make this Indigo _well_.\"\n\n\"How can you do that?\"\n\n\"It's simple,\" Mike said irritably. \"The Indigos must have a\nmalformation of the heart causing an abnormal communication between\nthe venous and arterial side of the circulation system. A little\nsurgery and I adjust a valve in the heart. No more communication.\nProper aeration. Enough oxygen. The deep blue color goes, leaving only\nthe lighter blue of the natural pigmentation. The patient feels better,\nacts better, thinks better, looks better. In short, he is no longer an\nIndigo but an Azure.\"\n\n\"Is--is this what you're going to show Lee?\" I ventured.\n\n\"Of course! It proves the Indigos _aren't_ an inferior race. They are\nthe same as the Azures except that they are sick. Their being sick\ncan't reflect unfavourably on any terrestrial colored race. There is no\nanalogy. But I have to prove it to Chon. We're going to tape the whole\nprocess and feed it to him.\"\n\n\"I think,\" I said, \"that that might get to him.\"\n\n\"Sure it will.\" Ellik's jaw muscles flexed. \"I should ruin Lee with\nthis thing, but I won't. I'm not a vindictive man. Lee and I will\nprobably be working together for years. But whenever he gets out of\nline--has some stubborn idea about doing something his way--don't think\nI won't remind him of this!\"\n\nSuddenly, he was smiling again. He turned to the gawking Indigo. He\npointed two fingers at him.\n\n\"_Mmr?_\" Ellik asked.\n\nThe alien tapped himself on his chest cavity twice. \"_Mhaw_,\" he gave\nhis name.\n\n\"_Mhaw M'i uh M'i m M'm'-uh?_\" Ellik asked him, without even using the\ntranslators.\n\n\"_M-m-M-m-M_,\" the alien went, slapping himself on the chest with his\nopened palms.\n\nEllik turned to me, grinning. \"I asked him if he wanted to stop being\nan Indigo and become an Azure. He thinks I can do anything and he's all\nfor it.\"\n\n\n\nAfter we fed Mhaw a dose of null-shock from our packs, Doc Ellik\nstarted to slice him open with a ceramic knife he had borrowed from the\nAzures.\n\nBut Ellik had forgotten that the alien might get frightened seeing\nhimself cut open, even if he couldn't feel any pain. It had never\nhappened to him before.\n\nThe alien lumbered to his feet, his chest hanging open, showing his\nheart beating like some animal caught inside a blueberry pudding.\n\nI drove a right cross into his jaw, and felt the jar all the way up to\nmy shoulder.\n\nHe melted back down onto the pallet.\n\n\"Good work, Johnny,\" Ellik said, stooping and starting his work.\n\nRight away, Mhaw started to lose that Indigo color and get real\nlight--lighter than the Azures, in fact. None of the blue of the race\nwas actually in the pigmentation, Mike found out. Even the Azures\nsuffered some degree of improper aeration of the blood.\n\n\"You going to call Lee Chon now?\" I asked Mike. \"You going to show him\nthe tape we had running during the operation and all?\"\n\n\"Not quite yet, Johnny,\" he said. \"First I want to educate Mhaw a bit,\nup to the Azure level or better. That should convince Lee.\"\n\nMhaw learned fast, probably faster than the Azures, even. Almost the\nfirst thing he wanted was for us to stop calling him Mhaw and start\nusing an Azure name, Aedo.\n\nOnce a day, Ellik left our hut to take some exercise--a walk along\nthe alien esplanade, he called it. I used to stay with the doctored\nalien, now Aedo, but we finally learned we could trust him to follow\nour orders--which were to stay inside, away from the others, since we\ndidn't know how they would take him. So I got to walking along with\nEllik.\n\nAs dusk lengthened, we could see the spark that was our ship in its\norbit along the retreating horizon.\n\nEllik twisted back his head and the side of his mouth. \"Look at him up\nthere--_look!_\"\n\nThe spark burned brighter and danced in another direction.\n\n\"He's gone! He left us!\" Ellik said.\n\n\"It's okay. He's still there. Just corrected the orbit a little, I\nguess.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" Ellik said. \"He started to make another try. But he got\nafraid to try to go into hyperspace alone.\"\n\n\"He was just correcting for orbital decay.\"\n\n\"You don't understand, Johnny. He's a coward. That makes him dangerous.\nHe's getting desperate. That desperation will burst the dam of his own\nweakness and wash away our hope, _our lives_.\"\n\nHis voice hushed. He stood staring starkly ahead, his palms\noutstretched at his sides.\n\n\"Maybe he isn't _that_ cowardly,\" I said hopefully.\n\n\n\n\"Finished,\" Ellik announced. He meant he had finished editing the tape\nshowing the operation on the alien and his recovery from his blue\ndisease, from being an Indigo to better than an Azure.\n\n\"The transmitter is finished too,\" I said.\n\nEllik had suggested a way of switching the tape camera to a video\nconverter for one of the audio communicators, and I had been able to\ndo it easy. It took parts from both our communicators and translators\ntoo.\n\nEllik fitted the coiled snake of tape into place. \"This will be a great\nday for your people, Aedo. After our friend from heaven lands, we will\nbe able to teach you a way to cure all of your sick, to make all the\nIndigos like you.\"\n\n\"Like me? Make like me?\" Aedo said in the pidgin terrestrial that Mike\nEllik had taught him.\n\n\"Yes. We'll show them how we cured you and how all can be cured.\"\n\n\"You make show fellow like me? Make tell make that fellow like fellow\nlike me?\"\n\n\"Everything's ready, Mike,\" I called.\n\n\"That's right, Aedo,\" Mike said. \"You'll show your people the way to\nequality.\"\n\n\"Make all fellow like this fellow?\" Aedo asked.\n\n\"Shall I call in Lee?\" I asked Mike.\n\n\"Yes, that's right, Aedo. Just right.\"\n\n\"No,\" Aedo said.\n\nThe alien stomped the tape camera and the communicator to bits before I\ncould get a hammerlock on him.\n\nEllik just stared at the complete wreck of our only means of\ncommunication with the spaceship.\n\n\"I be much man now. I much smart. Much smart than Azure hicks and\nIndigo slobs. I much smart all. I much man! Not to be all same now.\n_No._\" The snarl hung on in Aedo's throat.\n\nEllik lifted his head and sort of smiled. But not quite.\n\n\"Well,\" he said slowly and sadly, \"what could you expect in the way of\ngratitude from a dirty alien?\"\n\n\n\nThe Azures did accept Aedo all right. They seem to think he must have\ncome from some other tribe. They don't associate him with the Indigo\nthat disappeared. No Indigo ever became an Azure before.\n\nOf course, Azures sometimes become Indigos, we found out.\n\nIt seems there's a virus of what Ellik called pseudo-cyanosis in the\nair. The Azures have become a pretty resistant breed to it, while the\nIndigos are all easy victims. But once in a while an Azure will come\ndown with it and turn Indigo.\n\nMike Ellik caught it too.\n\nIt happened pretty fast. By the time we realized what it was, he was\nalready too stupid to finish the operation he started on himself. I had\nto sew him up, not very neatly.\n\nEllik is treated pretty much like the rest of the Indigos. So am I. He\ntakes it all pretty calm. He can still talk a little Earth. Whenever\nanybody kicks him, Ellik just mutters something about, \"What can fellow\nexpect bunch lousy creeps like those fellow?\"\n\nI guess I'll get it too. I think I am getting it.\n\nIt won't be so bad for me. Just like maybe going around drunk all the\ntime, not being able to think or coordinate very well.\n\nIt will be kind of bad being a member of an inferior race, but the\nthing I'll hate about it the most isn't that, or even leaving old Lee\nup there, circling around and waiting for our call forever.\n\nNo, the thing I hate is having it happen _now_, just when I'm beginning\nto _learn_ something.\n\nI'm not dead sure I know just exactly what I learned, but I think maybe\nI do:\n\nYou get just what you damned well expected all along from a bunch of\nblue-blooded mongrels!\n\n\n\n\n",
