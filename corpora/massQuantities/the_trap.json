    "body": "Old Miss Barbara Noble twitched aside the edge of the white scrim\ncurtain to get a better look at the young man coming down the street.\nHe might be the one.\n\nThe young man bent a little under the weight of the battered black\nsuitcase as he crossed Maple and started up Prospect on Miss Noble's\nside. She could see him set the case down on the wide porch of the\nRaney house and wipe his forehead with a handkerchief. Then she lost\nsight of him as he advanced to the door. He could be a visitor to the\nRaney's, but they were out of town on vacation. He could be a\nsalesman.\n\nMiss Barbara shifted her rocker to the other side of the window where\nshe could watch without having to disturb the curtain. This\nsecond-floor sitting room made an excellent lookout. She quickly\nscanned the street in the other direction, but there was no sign of\nmovement in the hot sunlight. She settled down to watch the black\nsuitcase sitting uncommunicatively at the edge of the porch.\n\nIt must have been all of two minutes before the young man appeared\nfrom under the over-hanging roof and picked up the case. A persistent\nfellow. He went down to the sidewalk and approached her own house,\ncame up on her own front doorstep, tried to set the case down on the\nnarrow stoop, couldn't, straightened up and rang the bell. A raucous\nbuzz filled the sitting room.\n\n\n\nBarbara Noble leaned toward the window, pulled back the curtain a\nscant inch, and studied his back as he looked at the windows on the\nother side of the front door. Limp yellow hair and a big perspiration\nstain in the middle of a dark sport shirt were her chief impressions.\nHe could be a bona fide salesman working hard at it. She wouldn't let\nhim in, of course; but she felt a little sorry for him lugging that\nbig case around in this weather. Then he turned and looked straight at\nthe window behind which she was hiding, and she let the curtain go\nsuddenly. Had he seen it move? The buzzer sounded again, imperiously.\n\nMiss Barbara got up stiffly, moved to the big vizer screen in the\nnearest corner, and switched it on. The man might have something\ninteresting and she couldn't get out to shop the way she used to. She\nsmoothed her lilac housedress and left the room to descend the stairs\nto the front door.\n\nIn the tiny front hall she hesitated, then opened the door inward\nabout eight inches. Deftly the man stuck the broad brown toe of his\nshoe into the opening and looked down at her. She grinned as she saw\nhis expression of shock.\n\nShe was old, really old. Her sparse white hair was pulled so tightly\ninto a knob on top of her head that the plentiful wrinkles on her\nforehead and around her eyes seemed to run vertically, giving her an\noriental look. The hand she rested on the door jamb was a waxy-white\nclaw, a blue vein standing up prominently under the skin tight-drawn\nover gnarly finger joints. He had probably never seen a woman much\npast middle age.\n\n\"Well?\" Her croak was high and rough.\n\n\n\nThe young man recovered himself and began his spiel. \"Madame, I\nrepresent one of the best-known and most reputable firms in the\ncountry. Our products have received three international medals for\npurity and effective performance. They....\"\n\n\"What are you selling, young man?\"\n\n\"I have the privilege of being a field representative for Taffeta\nBeauty Aids. Please accept this generous ten-ounce bottle of our\nDiamond Dew Refreshest Lotion....\" He reached into his side pocket and\nbrought it out, offered it with the most appreciative smile, his 'you\nhardly need this' smile.\n\nHer hand did not reach out. \"I don't want any. Goodbye!\" The door\ntightened against his foot.\n\n\"But madame,\" his foot did not budge and his smile became both\nengaging and pleading, \"all I ask is a chance to show you our line.\nOur products sell themselves. Besides, I'm paid on a demonstration\nbasis--so much for every potential customer who receives our free\nsample and so much for every home demonstration. You wouldn't want me\nto lose two-fifty when it would take only six and a third minutes of\nyour time exactly to look over one of the most amazing displays\never....\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know....\"\n\n\"I know you'll enjoy watching our Tissue Cleanser in action and seeing\nthe new simplicity of our Home Re--....\" (oops, he'd almost said it)\n\"... Hair Relustrification Kit. I promise you that your few minutes\nwon't be wasted.\"\n\n\"Yours would be, young man. I don't buy that stuff.\"\n\n\"You may be one of the lucky few women who don't need our products,\nbut I don't think you can say that before you've seen them.\"\n\n\"I never did see such persistence, honest to goodness!\" Her face\nassumed a crabbed smile. \"Come along then.\"\n\n\n\nShe moved back from the door into the darkness of the house; and the\nsalesman shifted his case back to his left hand, pushed the front door\nwide and took a quick long step inside. He was just in time to hear\nthe slight click of the closing of a second door in front of him. He\nreached for the knob, turned it; but the door was locked. The outside\ndoor still stood open, caught by the end of the sample case.\n\nThe July daylight from outside showed him that he was in a tiny\nentrance hall not more than forty inches each way. He pulled the case\nin and by squeezing against the inner door allowed the front door to\nclose. Anyhow, he was inside the house. He rapped sharply on the inner\ndoor.\n\nThe latch on the front door snapped to and instantly the hall was\nflooded with light from a tremendous bulb in the ceiling, which,\nsurprisingly, was twenty feet above him.\n\nA harsh voice, tinny with tremendous amplification but unmistakably\nthat of the old woman, filled the hall, \"ALL RIGHT, YOUNG MAN. I HAVE\nTHE VIZER TURNED ON YOU. LET'S SEE THE DEMONSTRATION. I BELIEVE YOU\nSAID SIX MINUTES. GET ON WITH IT.\"\n\nScreening his eyes with his fingers, the salesman scanned the walls\nand ceiling for the vizer lens, found it beside the five-hundred watt\nbulb pouring blindingly down on him, on the other side of a speaker\ngrille.\n\n\"C-certainly, madame.\" What a layout. As he automatically laid his\ncase on the floor and opened back the top against the front door, his\neyes searched the walls for indications of openings which might mean\nunexpected defenses such as anesthetic tanks. The only breaks in the\ntwo smooth white plaster surfaces which he could see as he squatted\nbefore the case were a horizontal row of glass bosses on each side at\nabout the height of his knees.\n\n\"Now, since my face,\" he closed his eyes and flashed a toothy smile,\nlike a video actor, up at the vizer lens, \"is subjected to the daily\ncare of Taffeta Products,\" he turned his face down to the case and\ngritted his teeth, \"I must smear facial muscle softener into the left\nhalf to show the action and appearance of muscles which have lost\ntheir tonus.\" He whipped the cover off a small ivorine jar and rubbed\nhis cheek vigorously with a brownish salve. \"You will note that this\nsoftener also contains a percentage of grime which lodges in the\npores.\"\n\nHe heard a gasp from the speaker grille when he displayed a face whose\nleft cheek and brow were sagged, wrinkled and hideously brown\nspeckled. From somewhere behind the gasp, he heard a continuous tinkle\nof tiny bells.\n\nHis hands moved among the bottles and jars, raised a round silver box\nwhich he held up. \"The delicately perfumed applicator pads for all\napplications of Taffeta Preparations are pre-saturated with Firmol\nTone Charger. I dip the pad into this solution of Enhancing Hyssop,\"\nhe did so, \"and work it gently into the pores. The results are\ninstantaneous!\" He turned up his original video star appearance.\n\n\n\nWhile bending his body forward to reach the articles strapped to the\ntop of the case, he noticed that the tone of the distant bells was\nraised. Screwing a circular hairbrush to the thread of a collapsible\ntube, he sank back on his haunches. The bell tones were lower. He\nplaced a hand on one of the glass bosses nearest the inner door,\napparently to steady himself. An even lower tone was added to the bell\nnotes. Obviously electric eyes with a set of bell signals in the old\nwoman's present location. He smiled down at the floor--to himself.\n\n\"Now I want you to notice closely this object which I will show you.\"\nHe held up the brush with the tube screwed on its back and turned it\nabout. \"Do you know what this is?\"\n\nThere was no answer from the speaker but its own hum and the tinkle of\nthe bells. \"What does it look like?\" He spoke rapidly, pleasantly.\nThere was still no answer.\n\nHe rose quickly and tried the knob of the inner door again. He could\nhear the bell notes lower in pitch as he pressed against the door.\n\n\"LET ME SEE THE THING AGAIN, YOUNG MAN. HONEST TO GOODNESS, WHAT\nDIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHETHER OR NOT I KNOW WHAT IT IS? IT LOOKS\nLIKE A HAIRBRUSH WITH SOME DO-JIGGER ON THE TOP.\"\n\nHe jumped back to the center of the hall. \"This brush is the essential\nfeature of our sensational Hair Relustrifier Kit. The tube screwed to\nthe top feeds the specially developed Brilliancette directly through\neach hollow bristle to reach every part of the hair.\" He ran or rather\nscrubbed the brush through the right side of his long fair pompadour\nwith small rotary motions. When he removed the brush, that side of his\nhead was covered with crisp yellow ringlets which shone under the\nlight like sculptured gold.\n\n\"THAT'S SOME SORT OF A TRICK! DO IT ON THE OTHER....\" Her voice was\ninterrupted by a syncopated clicking. A telephone signal. \"JUST A\nMOMENT, YOUNG MAN.\" The hum of the speaker cut off and the sudden\nsilence seemed full of the echoes of the bells.\n\n\n\nInstantly the man dropped the gadget into the case and grabbed a\nhandful of cleansing tissues from a box in it. He snapped down the top\nof the case and whipped the straps through the buckles. Then he shoved\nthe case against one of the side walls and sat on it to flip off his\nshoes and socks. Shoving his back tightly against the wall, he bent\nhis knees up and pushed his bare feet flat against the other. After\nplacing the wad of tissues in his lap, he put his hands against the\nwall below his buttocks and, like an experienced mountain climber,\ninched his way rapidly up the 'chimney' of the hall. When his head\ntouched the ceiling, he braced himself firmly with his left hand and\nreached with his right for the tissues in his lap. Protecting his hand\nwith several of the white papers, he felt above him for the base of\nthe light bulb, unscrewed it, and dropped it gently onto the rest of\nthe tissues still in his lap. The sudden blackness was smothering.\n\nHeat seeped through the tissues more rapidly than he had expected; and\nthe effort to keep his knees from contracting and spilling him in the\nutter darkness to the floor fifteen feet below was agony.\n\nWhen he finally reached the floor, he placed the bulb on it beside the\nsample case. Then he opened the front door and closed it again,\nleaving the door caught open a fraction of an inch by the latch\nagainst the frame. Taking an anesthetic cartridge out of his pants\npocket, he broke the seal, taking care not to trigger it, and returned\nto his crevice-climbing posture. He lifted himself again above the row\nof electric eyes and waited, cartridge in hand, leg muscles cramping\npainfully.\n\n\n\nAfter Miss Noble had turned off the speakphone, she pulled herself\naway from the fascinating view of golden curls and scuttled over to a\nstiff ladder-back chair beside the telephone stand. She lifted the\nantique cradle phone (none of these modern invasions of privacy like\nthe vizerphone) and spoke warily into the mouthpiece.\n\n\"Who is it? What do you want?\"\n\n\"Barbara?\" A man's voice was urgent.\n\n\"This is Miss Noble speaking,\" she replied haughtily.\n\nThe voice was savage. \"Well, this is _Doctor_ Harris, then. Have you\nlooked at the mail today? I got my directors' meeting notice this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Yes, I got one. The fifth of August,\" she said impatiently.\n\n\"And this seems to be our year. There's been a girl here already this\nmorning with some story about my having advertised for a housekeeper.\nShe told it to the doorphone and wouldn't leave when I said I didn't\nwant anybody--but it only took one drop of skunk oil in the hallway to\nsend her packing.\" The horrid chuckle that came from the receiver was\nso raucous that Miss Noble held it away from her ear.\n\n\"Blonde or brunette?\" she asked noncommittally.\n\n\"Blonde--and really young, not a damn rejuvenee!\"\n\n\"Rod Harris! You actually went and peeked at her, you old goat!\"\n\n\"Only through the one-way.\"\n\n\"Well, since the company knows that a pretty girl is still good bait\nfor an old ninny, you're as good as a goner. They'll have _you_\nrejuvenated before long.\"\n\n\"They won't get a chance to! And I'm going to get old enough so I\ncan't even lift a hand to thumb my nose at the company. Then I'm going\nto go and die and the Juvine Perpetual Youth Corporation will scream\nin agony as it disbands and makes public property of its hallowed\nformulas as per the original articles of incorporation ... and _you_\nwill probably get a new set of false teeth and take the treatment\nagain since you could get it real cheap when the monopoly's finished\nand not have to disturb your millions salted away in the sugar bowl.\"\n\nThis mixture of facetiousness and downright sarcasm was only surpassed\nby Miss Noble, who snapped back, \"Don't you sneer at me, Doctor Roland\nHarris, when you know perfectly well that the _only_ reason I have to\ngo on living this long is to make sure that you are really dead first.\nYou didn't invent rejuvenation all by yourself without the aid of\nBarbara Noble, Ph.D., and the company has the sole right to the\nprocess until we're _both_ dead. And, if you start peeking at plump\nblonde wenches at this point, I suppose I'll have to live till Los\nAlamos freezes over!\"\n\n\"All right, all right. But she wasn't plump. She wasn't any bigger\nthan you are. Besides, you know I'd rather have dinner with you. My\nman Marko could give us roast beef with all the fixings and afterward\nI want you to hear my latest discovery. It's the best damn\nextempore-singer you've ever heard, Jeery Wade--fellow in his first\nlate fifties, no fluff-brain of a juvenee--a blood and thunder\nbaritone that'll lift that knob of hair clean off your scalp. Let's\nsay you get here about six-thirty and I'll phone him we'll be over at\nhis place for a session of hollering about eight.\"\n\n\n\nMiss Noble's scorn needed no vizer to carry it over the wire in full\nforce. \"I'm not going to budge out of this house until after the\ndirector's meeting and then only if the shops stop all delivery\nservice. This time I'm not taking any chances. Life is too much of a\nbore to have to put up with it for another eighty years even for your\nmarvelous singer who would probably go and get rejuvenated just as I\ngot to enjoy him. And _nothing_ could induce me to listen to an\nevening of your stories for the nine hundredth time. If there's one\nthing I'm thankful for in this scatter-brained age, it's the marriage\ndissolution law that's got me free from your anecdotes after three\nseparate terms of fifty years each.\"\n\n\"Now, Barbara, was it that bad?\" Roland Harris sounded distressed.\n\n\"Do you really think I could be honestly grateful to the Corporation\nfor a hundred and fifty years of listening to that disgraceful old\nthing about the Martian, the Venusian, and the robot?\"\n\n\"Well, if you feel that way about it, I'll keep my discoveries to\nmyself. I hope your fancy hallway keeps you safe till you rot.\"\n\n\"It's doing all right,\" replied the old woman smugly. \"I have a young\npup down there right now cooling his number thirteens and waiting to\npretend to interest me in some new face paint and hair gik. My\nelectric eye set and vizer are less repulsive than your skunk oil and\n_twice_ as effective.\"\n\n\"They're not going to stop me from having a good time while I last,\nanyhow. I think they're through with me for today; and I'm going to\nhear Jeery Wade, anyhow. He'll make up a hooting good song about all\nthis when I tell him.\"\n\n\"Take care of yourself, Rod ... goodbye,\" said Miss Noble, almost\nconcernedly.\n\nShe dropped the phone into its cradle, rose, and went back to the\nvizer screen, switching on the speaker as she sat down. Only then did\nshe notice that the screen was entirely dark except for a vague sliver\nof gray.\n\n\"Are you still there, young man?\" she asked the microphone.\n\nThere was silence from the speaker. The hammer on each bar of the long\nmetal xylophone of the electric eye signal hung motionless.\n\n\"He's gone ... and left the front door unlatched too. And I thought he\nwas persistent.\" She was disappointed. \"He owes me four more minutes\nof fun.\"\n\nShe got up slowly and started for the door. \"That curly hair stuff is\nnew since my last sixties, too. I wonder if it would work on white\nhair ... I'd better go down and close the door. Can't have just\nanybody coming into one's house.\"\n\n\n\nShe descended the stairs, opened the door from the front room, then\ntook one step forward into the hall. Before she could interpret the\nsoft bump of the salesman's bare feet as they struck the floor, she\nwas encircled by his strong arm; and the hiss of the anesthetic gun\nwas loud in the small area of the hall. Limply she sagged against his\narm.\n\nThe hissing of the gun stopped. The young man slipped it into his\npocket and, turning, thrust the inner door wide open with his now free\nhand. Entering the tidy front room, he kicked the door shut behind him\nand gulped in the good air before he headed for the back of the house,\ncradling the small body easily in his arms. Failing to find there what\nhe was looking for, he went up the narrow white-railed stairway to the\nsecond floor. Across the landing, the gleam of porcelain showed\nthrough a half-open door.\n\nHe laid his burden carefully on the vari-colored braided rug by the\ntub and began to draw a warm bath, testing the temperature frequently\nwith his hand. When water reached the overflow outlet, he turned off\nthe tap and sprinted downstairs for his sample case. The hall was\nstill chokingly full of gas; and after grabbing out the case, he\nslammed the door again. He brought the case up to the bathroom, where\nhe opened it on the floor beside the form of the old woman. He lifted\nout the tray, revealing masses of silvery tubing and a number of\nflasks of iridescent solutions nestling among loops of rubber\ninsulated wiring. One flask he emptied into the bath, making the water\nseethe and turn a cloudy green.\n\nThen, dashing down the stairs again, he began looking for the\ntelephone. His search became more and more hurried, as he opened\ncupboards and drawers in front room and kitchen with no success.\nReturning upstairs, he almost missed the instrument in the\nsitting-room because he was expecting the familiar sight of a round\nvizer screen. He stood over the phone and dialed.\n\n\"Hey, Alice!\"\n\n\"What luck, Riggy?\"\n\n\"I'm in. The old lady's out cold on the bathroom floor. Primer\nsolution's in the bath at five above tepid. I'm shoving her in\nnow--with all her clothes on, of course--and I've wasted a lot of time\nalready looking for this hypoblastic phone, so beat it on over here\nwith Margy and get to work.\"\n\n\"Are you ordering me around, Rigel O'Maffey?\"\n\n\"You know I never did this job on a woman. And don't forget, honey,\nwe'll get enough out of this to get a new copter together. C'mon now.\"\nHe put the phone back in, the cradle before she could answer.\n\n\n\nBack in the bathroom, he drew a long thermometer from the case, took a\ncareful reading on the water, ran in a little more hot from the faucet\nand left it running the slightest dribble.\n\nCarefully lifting the small body of Barbara Noble, Ph.D., he slid it\ngently into the water feet first over the end, smoothing down with one\nhand the percale housedress which ballooned as she went into the\nwater. Finally he knelt beside the tub, holding her head out of the\nwater in the crook of his elbow.\n\nA banging on the inner door downstairs some fifteen minutes later\nreminded him of the force with which he had slammed it in his hurry to\nreach the uncontaminated air of the front room. He looked longingly\nacross the bathroom at the racks of towels on the other side, but\nfinally, as the banging stopped and a feminine voice began yelling,\n\"Hey, Riggy! Let us in!\" he grabbed up the bright rug and wadded it\nunder the scrawny neck.\n\nThe girls scolded him all the way up the stairs for not leaving the\ndoor unlocked, while he tried to explain, at the same time, that he\nhad to hold up the woman's head.\n\n\"Screepers, Riggy, what do you think the perfectly good pair of\nwater-wings in your case is for?\"\n\nHumbled, he departed as the girls took over the beginning of the\ncomplicated, fortnight-long process of the rejuvenation of Barbara\nNoble.\n\n\n\nThe receptionist behind the ebony desk, whose gold plate proclaimed it\nas the headquarters of the Juvine Perpetual Youth Corporation, crammed\nshut the drawer before her. A metallic clink from within was the fall\nof a mirror with which she had been assisting the application of\nscarlet which now fluoresced gently on her full lips.\n\nTossing her head (which showed the crop of glistening black curls to\nthe fullest advantage) in a preoccupied manner, she addressed the man\nwho stood before her desk. \"How can the Juvine Perpetual Youth\nCorporation serve you?\" Her hastily assumed look of efficient\nimportance was replaced by melting eagerness as she took in the\nchiselled perfection of features and the broad shoulders of the young\nman in knife-creased bronze spunlon.\n\n\"I'm Harris. For the directors' meeting.\" His voice was curt.\n\n\"_You're_ Doctor Harris? The Director? Oh, do come in.\" She rose from\nthe desk and went around the end of it to open the high wrought-gold\ngate and hold it wide for him. \"You're a little early. I'll take you\ndown to the Board Room.\" Eager willingness to help was apparent in her\nevery gesture.\n\n\"Thanks, I know the way,\" he informed her, brushing past.\n\nShe followed him, however, across the patio-like reception room, with\nits exotically gardened borders and splashing fountain, down the long\ncorridor past glowing murals of men and women swimming, dancing and\nplaying tennis, past tapestry shielded doorways to the great bright\narch at the end. Before he went through, she caught his sleeve.\n\n\"I should be pleased to steno for you today, if you need me.\"\n\nHe turned and looked at her as if he had not known she was behind him.\n\"Thanks, but I sha'n't need one. It'll be a short meeting.\" He smiled\ndown and patted her cheek. \"But if I'm not entirely satisfied with the\nproceedings, maybe I can dictate a little afterward.\"\n\nShe laughed as if that were a special joke between them and retreated\nrapidly down the corridor before he had time to turn and miss the\nsplendor of her graceful carriage.\n\nHis eyebrows were still raised and the corners of his mouth curved in\nappreciation when he passed through the arch and into the vast room\nunder the clear bubble of a tremendous skydome.\n\n\n\nA girl was sitting there, her back to him, looking out over the\nsimmering city streets to the cool rise of mountains beyond. He\nrecognized at once the slight figure, the sheen of the long curling\nauburn bob, the poise of her head and slim hand resting on the arm of\nthe chair.\n\n\"Babs!\"\n\nShe turned half around. \"Hello, Rod.\"\n\nHe grinned and sank down in the next chair. \"Here we are again.\"\n\n\"Knocked out by your own skunk oil?\" she asked pointedly.\n\n\"No. Company copter man got me leaving Jeery Wade's. What happened to\nyou? I thought you were walled up neatly for the declining years.\"\n\n\"The cosmetic man ambushed me in the hall. But I've got another fifty\nyears to figure out something better ... if I still need it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean _if_ you still need it? Are you changing your mind\nabout rejuvenation?\"\n\nShe smiled. \"Well, you know it's always fun at first. But I'm having\nmy lawyer come to this meeting. I've got an idea we can change the\narticles of agreement so that the process can finally become public\nproperty at the end of another fifty years instead of only after our\ndeaths. Then if we want to go on and die, nobody\" (she waved her hand\naround the great room at the little group of athletic men and\nglamorous, expensively gowned women moving in through the arch)\n\"nobody will have any financial interest in rejuvenating us. Then,\ntoo, our own fat incomes will lapse; and since that's the reason we\nset up the articles the way they are--so we'd never be in danger of\nstarving, that is--we'd have the more interesting choice of whether to\ndie off or get young again and go back to work. Would you sign a\nfifty-year termination, Rod?\"\n\n\"Would you marry me for the fifty years, Babs?\" His voice was gentle,\npleading.\n\n\"Honest to goodness, now, aren't you really pretty tired of me?\" she\nasked earnestly, turning to face him.\n\n\"No, I can't say I am. You're pretty special, doctor, and you're\nspecial pretty.\" It was a ritual.\n\n\"You know you're the only man. I'll marry you. Will you sign?\"\n\n\"Of course I'll sign. I would have anyhow when I knew you wanted me\nto. And Babs--maybe we could get some sort of jobs now--sort of to get\nin practice. I'll bet we could rent a lab somewhere and do commercial\nanalyses for a while until we got hit by another idea for research.\"\n\n\"Rod, that's the best idea you've had in the last hundred and fifty\nyears. But we could have a honeymoon first, couldn't we?\"\n\n\"That's your best suggestion in the last seventy years. And maybe we\ncould get Jeery Wade and his wife to rejuvenate and go with us. After\nthe first couple of weeks, that is.\"\n\n\n\nThey left the meeting arm in arm, somewhat ahead of the rather\ndisgruntled group of directors, who stayed behind to lament the end of\na good thing. In the garden room, Barbara stopped to choose an orchid.\n\nRod Harris wandered on to the receptionist's desk, where the girl of\nthe black curls waited, smiling.\n\nHe looked back at Barbara, then smiled down at the girl. \"Just like I\nsaid ... a short meeting. No need for any dictating. Lucky you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" she countered coyly.\n\n\"Say, I heard a story the other day you might like. Do you like\nstories?\"\n\n\"What kind of story?\"\n\n\"You'd have to be the judge of that.\"\n\nSuddenly Barbara was with them, pinning on a bronze and green blossom.\n\"C'mon along, dear. We've got a good many things to do before we\nleave.\"\n\nHe opened the golden wicket for her and followed her out. Turning back\ntoward the desk, he called to the girl, \"I may be back in a few weeks\nto see about a job. Remind me then to tell you the one about the\nMartian, the Venusian and the robot.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
