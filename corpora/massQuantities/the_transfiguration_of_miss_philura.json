KINGSLEY\n_Registered at Stationers' Hall, London, England_\n[PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA]\nHour-Glass Stories Edition. Published March, 1902\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n\nMiss Philura Rice tied her faded bonnet-strings under her faded chin\nwith hands that trembled a little; then she leaned forward and gazed\nanxiously at the reflection which confronted her. A somewhat pinched and\nwistful face it was, with large, light-lashed blue eyes, arched over\nwith a mere pretense at eyebrows. More than once in her twenties Miss\nPhilura had ventured to eke out this scanty provision of Nature with a\nmodicum of burned match stealthily applied in the privacy of her virgin\nchamber. But the twenties, with their attendant dreams and follies, were\ndefinitely past; just how long past no one knew exactly--Miss Philura\nnever informed the curious on this point.\n\nAs for the insufficient eyebrows, they symbolized, as it were, a meagre\nand restricted life, vaguely acknowledged as the dispensation of an\nobscurely hostile but consistent Providence; a Providence far too awful\nand exalted--as well as hostile--to interest itself benignantly in so\nsmall and neutral a personality as stared back at her from the large,\ndim mirror of Cousin Maria Van Deuser's third-story back bedroom. Not\nthat Miss Philura ever admitted such dubious thoughts to the select\ncircle of her conscious reflections; more years ago than she cared to\ncount she had grappled with her discontent, had thrust it resolutely\nout of sight, and on the top of it she had planted a big stone marked\nResignation. Nevertheless, at times the stone heaved and trembled\nominously.\n\n\n\nAt sound of a brisk tap at her chamber door the lady turned with a\nguilty start to find the fresh-colored, impertinent face of the French\nmaid obtruding itself into the room.\n\n\"Ze madame waits,\" announced this individual, and with a coldly\ncomprehensive eye swept the small figure from head to foot.\n\n\"Yes, yes, my dear, I am quite ready--I am coming at once!\" faltered\nMiss Philura, with a propitiatory smile, and more than ever painfully\naware that the skirt of her best black gown was irremediably short and\nscant, that her waist was too flat, her shoulders too sloping, her\ncomplexion faded, her forehead wrinkled, and her bonnet unbecoming.\n\nAs she stepped uncertainly down the dark, narrow stairway she rebuked\nherself severely for these vain and worldly thoughts. \"To be a church\nmember, in good and regular standing, and a useful member of society,\"\nshe assured herself strenuously, \"should be and _is_ sufficient for me.\"\n\nTen minutes later, Miss Philura, looking smaller and more insignificant\nthan usual, was seated in the carriage opposite Mrs. J. Mortimer Van\nDeuser--a large, heavily upholstered lady of majestic deportment, paying\ndiligent heed to the words of wisdom which fell from the lips of her\nhostess and kinswoman.\n\n\"During your short stay in Boston,\" that lady was remarking\nimpressively, \"you will, of course, wish to avail yourself of those\nmeans of culture and advancement so sadly lacking in your own\nenvironment. This, my dear Philura, is pre-eminently the era of\nprogressive thought. We can have at best, I fear, but a faint\nconception of the degree to which mankind will be able, in the years of\nthe coming century, to shake off the gross and material limitations of\nsense.\"\n\nMrs. Van Deuser paused to settle her sables preliminary to recognizing\nwith an expansive smile an acquaintance who flashed by them in a\nvictoria; after which she adjusted the diamonds in her large, pink ears,\nand proceeded with unctuous tranquillity. \"On this occasion, my dear\nPhilura, you will have the pleasure of listening to an address by Mrs.\nB. Isabelle Smart, one of our most advanced thinkers along this line.\nYou will, I trust, be able to derive from her words aliment which will\ninfluence the entire trend of your individual experience.\"\n\n\"Where--in what place will the lady speak--I mean, will it be in the\nchurch?\" ventured Miss Philura in a depressed whisper. She sighed\napprehensively as she glanced down at the tips of her shabby gloves.\n\n\"The lecture will take place in the drawing-room of the Woman's\nOntological Club,\" responded Mrs. Van Deuser, adding with austere\nsweetness of tone: \"The club deals exclusively with those conceptions or\nprinciples which lie at the base of all phenomena; including being,\nreality, substance, time, space, motion, change, identity, difference,\nand cause--in a word, my dear Philura, with ultimate metaphysical\nphilosophy.\" A majestic and conclusive sweep of a perfectly gloved hand\nsuggested infinity and reduced Miss Philura into shrinking silence.\n\n\n\nWhen Mrs. B. Isabelle Smart began to speak she became almost directly\naware of a small, wistful face, with faded blue eyes and a shabby,\nunbecoming bonnet, which, surrounded as it was on all sides by tossing\nplumes, rich velvets and sparkling gems, with their accompaniments of\nfull-fleshed, patrician countenances, took to itself a look of positive\ndistinction. Mrs. Smart's theme, as announced by the President of the\nOntological Club, was Thought Forces and the Infinite, a somewhat\nformidable-sounding subject, but one which the pale, slight, plainly\ndressed but singularly bright-eyed lady, put forward as the speaker of\nthe afternoon, showed no hesitancy in attacking.\n\nBefore three minutes had passed Miss Philura Rice had forgotten that\nsuch things as shabby gloves, ill-fitting gowns, unbecoming bonnets and\nsuperfluous birthdays existed. In ten minutes more she was leaning\nforward in breathless attention, the faded eyes aglow, the unbecoming\nbonnet pushed back from a face more wistful than ever, but flushed with\na joyful excitement.\n\n\n\n\"This unseen Good hems us about on every side,\" the speaker was saying,\nwith a comprehensive sweep of her capable-looking hands. \"It presses\nupon us, more limitless, more inexhaustible, more free than the air that\nwe breathe! Out of it _every_ need, _every_ want, _every_ yearning of\nhumanity can be, must be, supplied. To you, who have hitherto led\nstarved lives, hungering, longing for the good things which you believe\na distant and indifferent God has denied you--to you I declare that in\nthis encircling, ever-present, invisible, exhaustless Beneficence is\nalready provided a lavish abundance of everything which you can possibly\nwant or think! Nay, desire itself is but God--Good--Love, knocking at\nthe door of your consciousness. It is impossible for you to desire\nanything that is not already your own! It only remains for you to bring\nthe invisible into visibility--to take of the everlasting substance what\nyou will!\n\n\"And how must you do this? Ask, and _believe that you have_! You have\nasked many times, perhaps, and have failed to receive. Why? You have\nfailed to _believe_. Ask, then, for what you will! Ask, and at once\nreturn thanks for what you have asked! In the asking and _believing_ is\nthe thing itself made manifest. Declare that it is yours! Expect it!\nBelieve it! Hold to it without wavering--no matter how empty your hands\nmay seem! _It is yours_, and God's infinite creation shall lapse into\nnothingness; His stars shall fall from high Heaven like withered leaves\nsooner than that you shall fail to obtain all that you have asked!\"\n\nWhen, at the close of the lecture, Mrs. B. Isabelle Smart became the\ncenter of a polite yet insistent crush of satins, velvets and\nbroadcloths, permeated by an aroma of violets and a gentle hum of\ndelicate flattery, she was aware of a timid hand upon her arm, and\nturned to look into the small, eager face under the unfashionable\nbonnet.\n\n\"You--you meant religious gifts, did you not?\" faltered the faint,\ndiscouraged voice; \"faith, hope and--and--the--the being resigned to\nGod's will, and--and endeavoring to bear the cross with patience.\"\n\n\n\n\"I meant _everything_ that _you_ want,\" answered the bright-eyed one\nwith deliberate emphasis, the bright eyes softening as they took in more\ncompletely the pinched outlines and the eager child's look shining from\nout the worn and faded woman's face.\n\n\"But--but there is so much! I--I never had anything that I really\nwanted--things, you know, that one could hardly mention in one's\nprayers.\"\n\n\"Have them now. Have them all. God is all. All is God. You are God's.\nGod is yours!\"\n\nThen the billowing surges of silk and velvet swept the small, inquiring\nface into the background with the accustomed ease and relentlessness of\nbillowing surges.\n\nHaving partaken copiously of certain \"material beliefs\" consisting of\nsalads and sandwiches, accompanied by divers cups of strong coffee, Mrs.\nJ. Mortimer Van Deuser had become pleasantly flushed and expansive. \"A\nmost unique, comprehensive and uplifting view of our spiritual\nenvironment,\" she remarked to Miss Philura when the two ladies found\nthemselves on their homeward way. Her best society smile still lingered\nblandly about the curves and creases of her stolid, high-colored visage;\nthe dying violets on her massive satin bosom gave forth their sweetest\nparting breath.\n\nThe little lady on the front seat of the carriage sat very erect; red\nspots glowed upon her faded cheeks. \"I think,\" she said tremulously,\n\"that it was just--wonderful! I--I am so very happy to have heard it.\nThank you a thousand times, dear Cousin Maria, for taking me.\"\n\nMrs. Van Deuser raised her gold-rimmed glasses and settled them under\narching brows, while the society smile faded quite away. \"Of course,\"\nshe said coldly, \"one should make due and proper allowance for facts--as\nthey exist. And also--er--consider above all what interpretation is best\nsuited to one's individual station in life. Truth, my dear Philura,\nadapts itself freely to the needs of the poor and lowly as well as to\nthe demands of those upon whom devolve the higher responsibilities of\nwealth and position; our dear Master Himself spoke of the poor as always\nwith us, you will remember. A lowly but pious life, passed in humble\nrecognition of God's chastening providence, is doubtless good and proper\nfor many worthy persons.\"\n\n\n\nMiss Philura's blue eyes flashed rebelliously for perhaps the first time\nin uncounted years. She made no answer. As for the long and presumably\ninstructive homily on the duties and prerogatives of the lowly, lasting\nquite up to the moment when the carriage stopped before the door of Mrs.\nVan Deuser's residence, it fell upon ears which heard not. Indeed, her\nnext remark was so entirely irrelevant that her august kinswoman stared\nin displeased amazement. \"I am going to purchase some--some necessaries\nto-morrow, Cousin Maria; I should like Fifine to go with me.\"\n\nMiss Philura acknowledged to herself, with a truthfulness which she felt\nto be almost brazen, that her uppermost yearnings were of a wholly\nmundane character.\n\nDuring a busy and joyous evening she endeavored to formulate these\nthronging desires; by bedtime she had even ventured--with the aid of a\nstubbed lead-pencil--to indite the most immediate and urgent of these\nwants as they knocked at the door of her consciousness. The list, hidden\nguiltily away in the depths of her shabby purse, read something as\nfollows:\n\n\"I wish to be beautiful and admired. I want two new dresses; a hat with\nplumes, and a silk petticoat that rustles. I want some new kid gloves\nand a feather boa (a long one made of ostrich feathers). I wish----\" The\nsmall, blunt pencil had been lifted in air for the space of three\nminutes before it again descended; then, with cheeks that burned, Miss\nPhilura had written the fateful words: \"I wish to have a lover and to\nbe married.\"\n\n\"There, I have done it!\" she said to herself, her little fingers\ntrembling with agitation. \"He must already exist in the encircling Good.\nHe is mine. I am engaged to be married at this very moment!\"\n\nTo lay this singular memorandum before her Maker appeared to Miss\nPhilura little short of sacrilegious; but the thought of the mysterious\nAbundance of which the seeress had spoken, urging itself, as it were,\nupon her acceptance, encouraged her. She arose from her evening orisons\nwith a glowing face. \"I have asked,\" she said aloud, \"and I _believe_ I\nshall have.\"\n\n\n\nMademoiselle Fifine passed a very enjoyable morning with Miss Philura.\nTo choose, to purchase, and above all to transform the ugly into the\nbeautiful, filled the French woman's breast with enthusiasm. Her glance,\nas it rested upon her companion's face and figure, was no longer coldly\ncritical, but cordially appreciative. \"Ze madame,\" she declared, showing\nher white teeth in a pleasant smile, \"has very many advantage. _Voil\u00e0_,\nze hair--_c'est admirable_, as any one may perceive! Pardon, while for\none little minute I arrange! Ah--_mon dieu!_ Regard ze difference!\"\n\nThe two were at this moment in a certain millinery shop conducted by a\ndiscreet and agreeable compatriot of Fifine's. This individual now\nproduced a modest hat of black, garnished with plumes, which, set\nlightly on the loosened bands of golden-brown hair, completed the effect\n\"_d\u00e9licieusement!_\" declared the French women in chorus.\n\nWith a beating heart Miss Philura stared into the mirror at her changed\nreflection. \"It is quite--quite true!\" she said aloud. \"It is all true.\"\n\nFifine and the milliner exchanged delighted shrugs and grimaces. In\ntruth, the small, erect figure, in its perfectly fitting gown, bore\nno resemblance to the plain, elderly Miss Philura of yesterday.\nAs for the face beneath the nodding plumes, it was actually\nradiant--transfigured--with joy and hope.\n\nMrs. J. Mortimer Van Deuser regarded the apparition which greeted her at\nluncheon with open disapproval. This new Miss Philura, with the prettily\nflushed cheeks, the bright eyes, the fluff of waving hair, and--yes,\nactually a knot of fragrant violets at her breast, had given her an\nunpleasant shock of surprise. \"I am sure I hope you can _afford_ all\nthis,\" was her comment, with a deliberate adjustment of eyebrows and\nglasses calculated to add mordant point and emphasis to her words.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Miss Philura tranquilly, but with heightened color;\n\"I can afford whatever I like now.\"\n\nMrs. Van Deuser stared hard at her guest. She found herself actually\nhesitating before Philura Rice. Then she drew her massive figure to its\nfull height, and again bent the compelling light of her gold-rimmed\nglasses full upon the small person of her kinswoman. \"What--er--I do not\nunderstand,\" she began lamely. \"_Where_ did you obtain the money for all\nthis!\"\n\nMiss Philura raised her eyebrows ever so little--somehow they seemed to\nsuit the clear blue eyes admirably today.\n\n\"The money?\" she repeated, in a tone of surprise. \"Why, out of the\nbank, of course.\"\n\nUpon the fact that she had drawn out and expended in a single morning\nnearly the whole of the modest sum commonly made to supply her meager\nliving for six months Miss Philura bestowed but a single thought. \"In\nthe all-encircling Good,\" she said to herself serenely, \"there is plenty\nof money for me; why, then, should I not spend this?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n\nThe village of Innisfield was treated to a singular surprise on the\nSunday morning following, when Miss Philura Rice, newly returned from\nher annual visit to Boston, walked down the aisle to her accustomed\nplace in the singers' seat. Whispered comment and surmise flew from pew\nto pew, sandwiched irreverently between hymn, prayer and sermon.\nIndeed, the last-mentioned portion of the service, being of unusual\nlength and dullness, was utilized by the female members of the\ncongregation in making a minute inventory of the amazing changes which\nhad taken place in the familiar figure of their townswoman.\n\n\"Philury's had money left her, I shouldn't wonder;\" \"Her Cousin Van\nDeuser's been fixin' her up;\" \"She's a-goin' to be married!\" were some\nof the opinions, wholly at variance with the text of the discourse,\nwhich found their way from mouth to mouth.\n\nMiss Electa Pratt attached herself with decision to her friend, Miss\nRice, directly the service was at an end. \"I'm just _dying_ to hear all\nabout it!\" she exclaimed, with a fond pressure of the arm linked within\nher own--this after the two ladies had extricated themselves from the\ncircle of curious and critical faces at the church door.\n\nMiss Philura surveyed the speaker with meditative eyes; it seemed to her\nthat Miss Pratt was curiously altered since she had seen her last.\n\n\"_Have_ you had a fortune left you?\" went on her inquisitor, blinking\nenviously at the nodding plumes which shaded Miss Philura's blue eyes.\n\"Everybody _says_ you have; and that you are going to get married soon.\nI'm sure you'll tell _me_ everything!\"\n\nMiss Philura hesitated for a moment. \"I haven't exactly had money left\nme,\" she began; then her eyes brightened. \"I have all that I need,\" she\nsaid, and straightened her small figure confidently.\n\n\"And _are_ you going to be married, dear?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Philura distinctly.\n\n\"Well, I _never_--Philura Rice!\" almost screamed her companion. \"Do tell\nme _when_; and _who_ is it?\"\n\n\"I can not tell you that--now,\" said Miss Philura simply. \"He is in----\"\nShe was about to add \"the encircling Good,\" but she reflected that Miss\nPratt might fail to comprehend her. \"I will introduce you to\nhim--later,\" she concluded with dignity.\n\nTo follow the fortunes of Miss Philura during the ensuing weeks were a\npleasant though monotonous task; the encircling Good proved itself\nwholly adequate to the demands made upon it. Though there was little\nmoney in the worn purse, there were numerous and pressing invitations\nto tea, to dinner, and to spend the day, from hosts of friends who had\nsuddenly become warm, affectionate, and cordially appreciative; and not\neven the new Methodist minister's wife could boast of such lavish\ndonations, in the shape of new-laid eggs, frosted cakes, delicate\nbiscuit, toothsome crullers and choice fruits as found their way to Miss\nPhilura's door.\n\n\n\nThe recipient of these manifold favors walked, as it were, upon air.\n\"For unto every one that hath shall be given,\" she read in the privacy\nof her own shabby little parlor, \"and he shall have abundance.\"\n\n\"Everything that I want is mine!\" cried the little lady, bedewing the\npages of Holy Writ with happy tears. The thought of the lover and\nhusband who, it is true, yet lingered in the invisible, brought a\nbecoming blush to her cheek. \"I shall see him soon,\" she reflected\ntranquilly. \"He is mine--mine!\"\n\nAt that very moment Miss Electa Pratt was seated in the awe-inspiring\nreception-room of Mrs. J. Mortimer Van Deuser's residence in Beacon\nStreet. The two ladies were engaged in earnest conversation.\n\n\n\n\"What you tell me with regard to Philura fills me with surprise and\nalarm,\" Mrs. Van Deuser was remarking with something more than her\naccustomed majesty of tone and mien. \"Philura Rice certainly did _not_\nbecome engaged to be married during her stay in Boston. Neither has she\nbeen the recipient of funds from myself, nor, to the best of my\nknowledge, from any other member of the family. Personally, I have\nalways been averse to the encouragement of extravagance and vanity in\nthose destined by a wise Providence to pass their lives in a humble\nstation. I fear exceedingly that Philura's visits to Boston have failed\nto benefit her as I wished and intended.\"\n\n\"But she _said_ that she had money, and that she was going to get\nmarried,\" persisted Miss Pratt. \"You don't suppose\"--lowering her\nstrident tones to a whisper--\"that the poor thing is going crazy?\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Van Deuser had concentrated her intellectual and penetrating orbs\nupon a certain triangular knob that garnished the handle of her\nvisitor's umbrella; she vouchsafed no reply. When she did speak, after\nthe lapse of some moments, it was to dismiss that worthy person with a\npracticed ease and adroitness which permitted of nothing further, either\nin the way of information or conjecture.\n\n\"Philura is, after all, a distant relative of my own,\" soliloquized Mrs.\nVan Deuser, \"and _as such_ is entitled to consideration.\"\n\nHer subsequent cogitations presently took shape to themselves and\nbecame a letter, dispatched in the evening mail and bearing the address\nof the Rev. Silas Pettibone, Innisfield. Mrs. Van Deuser recalled in\nthis missive Miss Philura's \"unfortunate visit\" to the Ontological Club,\nand the patent indications of its equally unfortunate consequences. \"I\nshould be inclined to take myself severely to task in the matter,\" wrote\nthe excellent and conscientious lady, \"if I had not improved the\nopportunity to explain at length, in the hearing of my misguided\nrelative, the nature and scope of God's controlling providence, as\nsignally displayed in His dealings with the humbler classes of society.\nAs an under-shepherd of the lowly flock to which Miss Rice belongs, my\ndear Mr. Pettibone, I lay her spiritual state before you, and beg that\nyou will at once endeavor to set right her erroneous views of the\noverruling guidance of the Supreme Being. I shall myself intercede for\nPhilura before the Throne of Grace.\"\n\n\n\nThe Rev. Silas Pettibone read this remarkable communication with\ninterest; indeed, after returning it to its envelope and bestowing it in\nhis most inaccessible coat-pocket, the under-shepherd of the lowly flock\nof Innisfield gave himself the task of resurrecting and reperusing the\nsuccinct yet weighty words of Mrs. Van Deuser.\n\nIf the Rev. Silas had been blessed with a wife, to whose nimbler wits he\nmight have submitted the case, it is probable that he would not have sat\nfor so long a time in his great chair brooding over the contents of the\nviolet-tinted envelope from Boston. But unfortunately the good minister\nhad been forced to lay his helpmate beneath the rough sods of the\nvillage churchyard some three years previous. Since this sad event, it\nis scarcely necessary to state, he had found it essential to his peace\nof mind to employ great discretion in his dealings with the female\nmembers of his flock. He viewed the matter in hand with vague\nmisgivings. Strangely enough, he had not heard of Miss Philura's good\nfortune, and to his masculine and impartial vision there had appeared no\nespecial change in the aspect or conduct of the the little woman.\n\n\"Let me think,\" he mused, passing his white hand through the thick, dark\nlocks, just touched with gray, which shaded his perplexed forehead. He\nwas a personable man, was the Rev. Silas Pettibone. \"Let me think: Miss\nPhilura has been very regular in her attendance at church and\nprayer-meeting of late. No, I have observed nothing wrong--nothing\nblameworthy in her walk and conversation. But I can not approve of\nthese--ah--clubs.\" He again cast his eye upon the letter. \"Ontology,\nnow, is certainly not a fit subject for the consideration of the female\nmind.\"\n\n\n\nHaving delivered himself of this sapient opinion, the reverend gentleman\nmade ready for a round of parochial visits. Foremost on his list\nappeared the name of Miss Philura Rice. As he stood upon the door-step,\nshaded on either side by fragrant lilac plumes, he resolved to be\nparticularly brief, though impressive, in his pastoral ministrations.\nIf this especial member of his flock had wandered from the straight and\nnarrow way into forbidden by-paths, it was his manifest duty to restore\nher in the spirit of meekness; but he would waste no unnecessary time or\nwords in the process.\n\nThe sunshine, pleasantly interrupted by snowy muslin curtains, streamed\nin through the open windows of Miss Philura's modest parlor, kindling\ninto scarlet flame the blossoms of the thrifty geranium which stood\nupon the sill, and flickered gently on the brown head of the little\nmistress of the house, seated with her sewing in a favorite\nrocking-chair. Miss Philura was unaffectedly glad to see her pastor. She\ntold him at once that last Sunday's sermon was inspiring; that she felt\nsure that after hearing it the unconverted could hardly fail to be\nconvinced of the error of their ways.\n\nThe Rev. Silas Pettibone seated himself opposite Miss Philura and\nregarded her attentively. The second-best new dress was undeniably\nbecoming; the blue eyes under the childish brows beamed upon him\ncordially. \"I am pleased to learn--ah--that you can approve the\ndiscourse of Sabbath morning,\" he began in somewhat labored fashion. \"I\nhave had occasion to--that is--er, my attention has been called of late\nto the fact that certain members of the church have--well, to put it\nbriefly, some have fallen grievously away from the faith.\"\n\nMiss Philura's sympathy and concern were at once apparent. \"I do not\nsee,\" she said simply, \"how one can fall away from the faith. It is so\nbeautiful to believe!\"\n\n\n\nThe small, upturned face shone with so sweet and serene a light that the\nunder-shepherd of the Innisfield flock leaned forward and fixed his\nearnest brown eyes on the clear blue eyes of the lady. In treatises\nrelating to the affections this stage of the proceedings is generally\nconceded to mark a crisis. It marked a crisis on this occasion; during\nthat moment the Rev. Silas Pettibone forgot at once and for all time the\nviolet-tinted envelope in his coat-tail pocket. It was discovered six\nmonth's later and consigned to oblivion by--but let us not anticipate.\n\n\"God is so kind, _so generous_!\" pursued Miss Philura softly. \"If we\nonce know Him as our Father we can never again be afraid, or lonely, or\npoor, or lacking for any good thing. How is it possible to fall away? I\ndo not understand. Is it not because they do not know Him?\"\n\nIt is altogether likely that the pastor of the Innisfield Presbyterian\nChurch found conditions in the spiritual state of Miss Philura which\nnecessitated earnest and prolonged admonition; at all events, the sun\nwas sinking behind the western horizon when the reverend gentleman\nslowly and thoughtfully made his way toward the parsonage. Curiously\nenough, this highly respectable domicile had taken on during his absence\nan aspect of gloom and loneliness unpleasantly apparent. \"A scarlet\ngeranium in the window might improve it,\" thought the vaguely\ndissatisfied proprietor, as he put on his dressing-gown and thrust his\nfeet into his newest pair of slippers. (Presented by Miss Electa Pratt\n\"to my pastor, with grateful affection.\")\n\n\"I believe I failed to draw Miss Philura's attention to the obvious\nrelation between faith and works,\" cogitated the reverend Silas, as he\nsat before his lonely hearth, placidly scorching the soles of his new\nslippers before the cheerful blaze. \"It will be altogether advisable, I\nthink, to set her right on that point without delay. I will--ah--just\nlook in again for a moment to-morrow afternoon.\"\n\n\n\n  \"God's purposes will ripen fast,\n    Unfolding every hour.\n  The bud may have a bitter taste,\n    But sweet will be the flower!\"\n\nsang the choir of the Innisfield Presbyterian Church one Sunday morning\na month later. And Miss Philura Rice--as was afterward remarked--sang\nthe words with such enthusiasm and earnestness that her high soprano\nsoared quite above all the other voices in the choir, and this despite\nthe fact that Miss Electa Pratt was putting forth her nasal contralto\nwith more than wonted insistence.\n\nThe last-mentioned lady found the sermon--on the text, \"Little children,\nlove one another, for love is of God\"--so extremely convincing, and her\nown subsequent spiritual state in such an agitated condition, that she\ntook occasion to seek a private conversation with her pastor in his\nstudy on that same Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"I don't know _when_ I've been so wrought up!\" declared Miss Pratt, with\na preliminary display of immaculate handkerchief. \"I cried _and cried_\nafter I got home from church this morning. Ma she sez to me, sez she,\n'What ails you Lecty?' And I sez to ma, sez I, 'Ma, it was that\n_blessed_ sermon. I don't know _when_ I ever heard anything like it!\nThat dear pastor of ours is just ripening for a better world!'\" Miss\nElecta paused a moment to shed copious tears over this statement. \"It\ndoes seem to me, _dear_ Mr. Pettibone,\" she resumed, with a tender\nglance and a comprehensive sniff, \"that you ain't looking as well as\nusual. I said so to Philura Rice as we was coming out of church, and I\nreally hate to tell you how she answered me; only I feel as though it\nwas my duty. 'Mr. Pettibone is perfectly well!' she says, and tossed\nthose feathers of hers higher'n ever. Philura's awful worldly, I _do\ngrieve_ to say--_if not worse_. I've been a-thinking for some time that\nit was my Christian duty (however painful) to tell you what Mis' Van\nDeuser, of Boston, said about----\"\n\nThe Rev. Silas Pettibone frowned with awful dignity. He brought down his\nclosed fist upon his open Bible with forensic force and suddenness.\n\"Miss Philura Rice,\" he said emphatically, \"is one of the most\nspiritual--the most lovely and consistent--Christian characters it has\never been my privilege to know. Her faith and unworldliness are\nabsolutely beyond the comprehension of--of--many of my flock. I must\nfurther tell you that I hope to have the great happiness of leading\nMiss Rice to the matrimonial altar in the near future.\"\n\nMiss Electa Pratt sank back in her chair petrified with astonishment.\n\"Well, I _must say_!\" she gasped. \"And she was engaged to you _all this\ntime_ and I never knew it!\"\n\nThe Rev. Pettibone bent his eyes coldly upon his agitated parishioner.\n\"I am at a loss to comprehend your very strange comment, Miss Pratt,\" he\nsaid; \"the engagement has been of such very short duration that I can\nnot regard it as surprising that you should not have heard of it.\nIt--ah--took place only yesterday.\"\n\nMiss Electa straightened her angular shoulders with a jerk. \"Yesterday!\"\nshe almost screamed. \"Well! I can tell _you_ that Philura Rice told _me_\nthat she was engaged to be married more than three months ago!\"\n\n\"You are certainly mistaken, madam,\" began the minister in a somewhat\nperturbed tone, which did not escape the notice of the now flushed and\ntriumphant spinster.\n\n\"More than three months ago!\" she repeated with incisive emphasis.\n\"_Now_ maybe you'll listen to me while I tell you what I know about\nPhilura Rice!\"\n\nBut the lady had reckoned without her host. The Rev. Silas arose to his\nfeet with decision. \"I certainly will _not_ listen to anything\nderogatory to Miss Rice,\" he said sternly. \"She is my promised wife,\nyou will remember.\" With that the prudent minister beat a hasty retreat,\nto entrench himself without apology or delay in the inner fastnesses of\nthe parsonage.\n\n\n\nMiss Electa rolled her greenish orbs about the chamber of learning with\na thoughtful smile. \"If Philura Rice ain't crazy,\" she said aloud; \"an'\nI guess she ain't far from it. She's told a wicked lie! In either case,\nit's my Christian duty to see this thing put a stop to!\"\n\nThat evening after service Miss Philura, her modest cheeks dyed with\npainful blushes, confessed to her promised husband that she had indeed\nannounced her intentions of matrimony some three months previous. \"I\nwanted somebody to--to love me,\" she faltered; \"somebody in particular,\nyou know; and--and I asked God to give me--a--a husband. After I had\nasked, of course I _believed_ that _I had_. He--he was already in the\nencircling Good, you know, or I should not have wanted him! When Electa\nasked me point blank, what could I say without--without denying--_God_?\"\n\nThe brave voice faltered more than once during this recital; and finally\nbroke down altogether when the Rev. Silas Pettibone, his brown eyes\nshining, exclaimed in joyful yet solemn tones, \"and God sent me!\"\n\nThe encircling Good was perfectly manifest at that moment in the shape\nof two strong arms. Miss Philura rested in them and was glad.\n\n\n\n\nTHE\n\nHOUR-GLASS\n\nSTORIES\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE COURTSHIP OF SWEET ANNE PAGE\n\nBy ELLEN V. TALBOT.
