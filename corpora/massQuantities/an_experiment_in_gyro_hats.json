When a shoe is on, it is full of foot, and when\na glove is on, it is full of hand; but a top hat is not, and never can\nbe, full of head, until such a day as heads assume a cylindrical shape,\nperfectly flat on top. And no sensible man ever expects that day to\ncome.\n\nI had, therefore, spent much of my leisure in devising methods by\nwhich the vacant space above the head in high hats might be turned\nto advantage, and my patents ranged all the way from a small filing\ncabinet that just occupied the waste space, to an extensible hat rack\non the accordion plan that could be pushed compactly into the top of\nthe top hat when the hat was worn, but could be extended into a hat and\ncoat rack when the hat was not in use. This device should have been\nvery popular, but I may say that the public received the idea coldly.\n\nMy attention had been for some time drawn away from this philanthropic\nwork by certain symptoms of uneasiness I noticed in my daughter Anne,\nand my wife and I decided after careful consideration that Anne must\nbe in love, and that her love must be unhappy. Otherwise we could not\naccount for the strange excitability of our usually imperturbable\ndaughter. As a practical hat dealer my time has been almost exclusively\ndevoted to hats and, as a good wife, my companion\u2019s attention has been\nalmost exclusively devoted to her husband, while Anne was usually so\ncalm and self-contained that she did not take my attention from my hat\nbusiness at all. But when such a daughter suddenly develops signs of\nweeping and sighs and general nervousness, any father, no matter how\ndevoted to the hat trade, must pay attention.\n\nOne of the primary necessities of a dealer in good hats is calm. An\nordinary hat dealer may not need calm. He may buy his hats as another\ndealer buys flour, in the bulk, and then trust to advertisements to\nsell them; but I am not that kind of hat dealer. Hat dealing is an\nart with me, and great art requires calm and peace in order that it\nmay reach its highest development. When I buy hats I do not think of\ndozens and dollars. No, indeed; I think of noses and ears. To be able\nto buy of a manufacturer a hat that will make the pug nose and big ears\nof a man I have never seen seem normal and beautiful when that man\nenters my store and buys a hat, requires calm. And no hatter can have\ncalm in his soul while his daughter is love sick and unhappy. I demand\nhappiness about and around me, and I must have it. So I told my wife,\nand I told her so most emphatically, and I informed her that Anne must\nbecome happy at once.\n\nPerhaps you can imagine the shock I received when my wife, after making\nthe necessary inquiries of Anne, informed me that Anne was indeed in\nlove, and in love with Walsingham Gribbs. It was not because Walsingham\nGribbs had never bought a hat of me that I was shocked. Bad hats are a\ncommon failing of mankind, and a man will try a hundred hatters before\nhe at last comes to me.\n\nThe trouble was deeper than this. The thing that staggered me was that\nWalsingham was a staggerer. (This is a joke, but I hold that a hatter\nhas as good a right to make a joke as the next man.)\n\nThat my daughter had fallen in love with Walsingham Gribbs without\nhaving met him was altogether to her credit. She first saw him when\nshe was crossing the ocean (for she travels where she pleases, my\nhat business affording her such pleasures) and that he reeled and\nstaggered about the boat did not impress her, for it was a stormy trip\nand everyone aboard reeled and staggered, even the captain of the boat.\nBut when she returned to New York and saw Walsingham Gribbs on the\nfirm pavement of Fifth Avenue, she had a harsh, cruel disillusionment.\nWalsingham Gribbs reeled and staggered on _terra firma_.\n\nI am glad to say that my daughter saw at once the impossibility of the\ndaughter of a high-class hatter mating with a permanent staggerer.\nAs she realized this, she became sad and nervous, thus creating an\natmosphere in my home that was quite opposed to the best high-class\nhatting, irritating my faculties and threatening to reduce me to the\nstate of a mere commercial hatter.\n\nFurther investigation only made the matter seem worse, for quiet\ninquiries brought out the information that Walsingham Gribbs had been\nstaggering since the year his father died. He had been constantly in a\nreeling, staggering state since his twentieth birthday. For such a man\nreform is, indeed, impossible. And what made the case more sad was that\nall proof seemed to point to the fact that Walsingham Gribbs was not a\n\u201cbounder\u201d nor a \u201crounder,\u201d two classes of men who occasionally acquire\na stagger and a reel in company with hearty boon companions.\n\nIn short, no one had ever seen Walsingham Gribbs take a drink in\npublic, and I was forced to conclude that he was of that horrid type\nthat drinks alone--\u201cAlone but with unabated zeal\u201d as that great poet,\nSir Walter Scott, has remarked in one of his charming poems.\n\nIf all these investigations of mine were conducted without the\nknowledge of Walsingham Gribbs, you must admit I did only what was\nright in keeping them secret from him; for since he had never met my\ndaughter he might have considered the efforts of a perfect stranger\nto peer into his life as being uncalled for. My wife did what she\ncould to comfort Anne, but Anne sadly replied that she could never\nmarry a man that staggered and reeled day in and day out. Thus day by\nday she became more sad, and I became so upset that I actually sold a\nnarrow-brimmed derby hat to a man with wide, outstanding ears.\n\nOf course this could not go on. No high-grade hat business could\nsupport it, and I was standing in my shop door looking gloomily out\nwhen I chanced to see Walsingham Gribbs stagger by. I had seen him\nmany times, but now, for the first time I noticed what I should have\nnoticed before--that he invariably wore a high hat, or \u201ctopper,\u201d as our\ncustomers like to call them.\n\nI observed that the shape was awful, and that the hat badly needed the\niron, and then my mind recurred to the old problem of the vacant space\nin the top of top hats; but I found I could not concentrate. Whenever\nI tried to think of top hats I thought of Walsingham Gribbs in one of\nthem, staggering and reeling up the street, and gradually the thought\ncame that it would be an excellent idea should I be able so to use the\nspace in the top of Walsingham\u2019s hat that he would no longer stagger\nand reel, and then the thought of the gyroscope hat came to me.\n\nI admit that at first I put the idea aside as futile, but it came back\nagain and again, and at length it seemed to force me into enthusiasm. I\ndropped everything and went to work on the gyro-hat.\n\nThe gyroscope is, as everyone knows, a top, and I might have called\nthe hat I invented a top hat, except that any tall cylindrical silk or\nbeaver hat is called a top hat, so I was forced to adopt the name of\ngyro-hat.\n\nA gyroscope is not an ordinary top. It is like a heavy fly wheel,\nrevolving on an axis; and if it is spun, the speed of the revolutions\nmaintains the axis in the perpendicular. A huge gyroscope is used to\nsteady the channel steamers, which would otherwise stagger and reel. A\ngyroscope has just been adopted to the monorail cars, and so long as\nthe gyroscope gyrates the monorail car cannot stagger or reel. If a\nproper gyroscope was placed on the end of a knitting needle and gyrated\nat full speed, that knitting needle could be stood on end and it would\nnot fall over.\n\nTherefore, if a gyroscope was placed in the top of a top hat, and the\ntop hat firmly fastened to the head of a man, and the gyroscope set\ngoing, that man would remain perpendicular in spite of anything. He\ncould not stagger. He could not reel. He could walk a line as straight\nas a crack.\n\nWhen I had completed this gyro-hat I showed it to my wife, and briefly\nexplained what it was and what I meant to do with it. The small but\nwonderfully powerful motor and the gyroscope itself were all concealed\ninside the hat, and I explained to my wife that Walsingham Gribbs\nneed but fasten the hat firmly on his head and he would never stagger\nagain. At first my wife seemed doubtful, but as I went on she became\nenthusiastic.\n\nThe only thing she disliked was the method of fastening the hat to the\nhead, for, as it was quite necessary that the hat be very firmly fixed\nto the head, I had sewed ear tabs to the hat, and these I tied firmly\nunder my chin. My wife said she feared it would require some time to\npersuade the public to take to silk hats with ear tabs, and that the\nsight of a man in a silk hat with ear tabs would be a sign that he was\na staggerer. She wanted another method of holding the hat on the head.\n\n\u201cVacuum suction,\u201d I said, for I am quick to catch an idea. A man has\nto be, in the hat business. \u201cBut,\u201d I added, \u201cwhere would you get the\nvacuum? A man cannot be expected to carry a can of vacuum, or whatever\nhe would need to carry vacuum in, around with him; especially the kind\nof man that would need the gyro-hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d said my wife, after a minute of thought, during which we\nboth studied the gyro-hat, \u201cI have it! Let the hat make its own vacuum.\nIf the hat is lined with air-tight aluminum, and has a rubber sweat\nband, and an expulsion valve, the gyroscope motor could pump the air\nout itself. It could create its own vacuum.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it could!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cI could rig it up so that putting\nthe hat on the head would start the gyroscope, and the gyroscope would\npump a vacuum. All any staggerer would need to do would be to put on\nhis hat, and the hat would do the rest. It would stay on his head and\nit would keep him evenly on his keel.\u201d (Of course I would not use a\nnautical term like \u201ckeel\u201d in my hat shop, but at home I allow myself\nsome liberties of that sort.)\n\nI set to work at once to perfect the gyro-hat on the plan suggested by\nmy wife and in a few days I was able to say it was a success. By this\nI mean it was a success in so far as the eye could judge by looking at\nthe hat, and all that was needed was a practical trial.\n\nAs the hat had been invented for Walsingham Gribbs more than for any\nother man, I proposed to my wife that Walsingham--we had spoken of him\nso often that we now mentioned him as Walsingham--should be the man to\ntry it out. But my wife is better posted in social matters than I, and\nshe said it would not do at all to attempt such a thing.\n\nIn the first place, none of us knew Walsingham; and in all the other\nplaces, it would be insulting to suggest such a thing to him, and might\nruin Anne\u2019s chances. I then assured my wife that I did not mean to\nallow any ordinary intoxicated man to experiment with the only gyro-hat\nI possessed, and possibly wreck and ruin it. We had too much at stake\nfor that. So, after considerable discussion, my wife and I decided upon\nwhat was, after all, the only rational course--I should try out the\ngyro-hat myself.\n\nI admit here that I am not much of a drinker. Although not so by\nprinciple, I am by action a teetotaller. I consider that the highest\ngood of a hat shop demands it. As a matter of fact I had never up to\nthis time tasted intoxicating liquor, but it was evident to my wife\nand me that the time had arrived when the hat business demanded this\nsacrifice on my part. Evidently, if a gyro-hat is meant to keep a\nstaggerer and reeler steady on his keel, the only test of the gyro-hat\nmust be on the head of a man who, without the hat, could not help\nstaggering and reeling--a thoroughly intoxicated man.\n\nWe did not, of course, admit Anne into our little conspiracy, and we\nchose a restaurant where we were sure intoxicants would be sold. We\nproceeded to the restaurant about the dinner hour; and after studying\nthe waiters carefully, I selected one that seemed likely to know\nsomething about intoxicants, and we seated ourselves at his table.\nI placed the gyro-hat carefully across my knees, first setting the\nstarter, and beckoned the waiter to us.\n\n\u201cMy good fellow,\u201d I said, when he had approached with his pencil and\norder card in hand, \u201cI desire to become intoxicated this evening, and I\npresume you know something about intoxicating liquors.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said the waiter.\n\n\u201cTell him, Henry,\u201d said my wife, \u201cthat we also wish something to\neat, but that as our principal object in coming here is to secure\nintoxicants, we wish him to be particular about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have heard what the lady said,\u201d I told the waiter, \u201cand you will\nbe guided accordingly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said the waiter, politely. \u201cDoes the lady desire to become\nintoxicated also?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeavens, no!\u201d exclaimed my wife.\n\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d said the waiter.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d I said to the waiter, \u201cyou doubtless have different kinds of\nintoxicating liquors here--some strong and some not so strong--and I\ndo not desire to drink a great quantity to obtain the result I desire.\nWhat would you recommend to give the required reeling and staggering\ncondition as quickly as possible?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cif you will let me advise, I would advise a\ncertain brandy we have. Of that brandy, sir, a little goes a long way.\nI have seen it work, sir, and I can assure you that a small quantity\nof that will make you stagger and reel to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said, \u201cyou may bring me some. I suppose a quart would be\nenough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cbut have you ever tried the brandy\nof which I speak?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen, sir,\u201d said the waiter apologetically, \u201cunless you are a very\nheavy drinker I would not advise a quart of that brandy. A quart of\nthat brandy, sir, would, if I may so speak, lay you out flat. You would\nnot reel and stagger, sir. You would be paralyzed stiff, sir, dead to\nthe world.\u201d\n\nI thanked the waiter warmly.\n\n\u201cYou observe,\u201d I said, \u201cthat I am not used to this sort of thing, and\nI appreciate the interest you are taking. I am inclined to leave the\nmatter entirely in your hands. I may not know when I have had exactly\nthe right quantity, but you, with your larger experience, will know,\nsir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. And I think the lady will know, sir,\u201d said the waiter.\n\nI found the brandy most unpleasant to the taste, but certain symptoms\nassured me that the waiter had not belied its effectiveness. Long\nbefore the waiter was satisfied that I would stagger and reel, my long\nlost vocal prowess returned and I caroled gaily some songs that had\nbeen favorites of my youth. Many of these were affectionate songs, and\nwhen I sang them I had a great longing to hold my wife\u2019s hand, and did\nso; but as she would not let me kiss her, I felt the need of kissing\nthe waiter. Here again I was repulsed, but it did not make me angry. I\nmerely slid down into my chair and waved my hand at him coquettishly.\n\n\u201cIf you please, sir,\u201d said the waiter, when I had finished another\nburst of song, \u201cI think you are pretty ripe, now. If you would just get\nup and walk a few steps I can tell more definitely.\u201d\n\nMy wife smiled at me reassuringly and nodded to me that what the waiter\nproposed had her full sanction; but even so, I was filled with a fear\nthat we were about to be parted forever, and for a few minutes I clung\nto her neck, weeping bitter tears. I then tore myself away, and I did\nindeed stagger and reel. I believe I knocked over two small tables and\nended by seating myself in the lap of a young man who was dining alone.\nHe accepted my apology before I had spoken more than fifteen minutes of\nit, and then he aided the waiter in steering me back to my table.\n\nWhatever may have been my past opinion of Walsingham Gribbs--for it was\nhe--I loved him most dearly at that moment, and in my incoherent manner\nI tried to tell him so. I think he understood. At any rate, he spoke to\nmy wife like a true gentleman.\n\n\u201cMadame,\u201d he said, \u201cI can sincerely sympathize with your husband, and\nif you will allow me, I will gladly help you assist him to a cab. I beg\nyou not to be frightened by his condition. I myself am subject to the\nsame trouble, and although he may seem drunk----\u201d\n\n\u201cSeem drunk!\u201d exclaimed my wife. \u201cSeem drunk! I beg you to know that my\nhusband is as drunk as a man can become without being senseless. Either\nthat, or we have been defrauded by this waiter!\u201d\n\nWalsingham Gribbs looked at my wife, and then smiled.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, \u201cif what you wanted was to have him drunk, I\u2019ll\nadmit that he is about the drunkest man I have ever seen. I only spoke\nas I did in order that I might spare your feelings, for most wives\nobject to seeing their husbands stagger and reel. I myself stagger and\nreel continually, and I have never tasted intoxicating liquor in my\nlife, but I can share the feelings of one who staggers and reels, or\nwho has a relative that staggers and reels.\u201d\n\nAt this my wife said:\n\n\u201cAre you not Walsingham Gribbs? If you are I am delighted to have met\nyou, even in this unconventional manner, for what brought us here will\ninterest you.\u201d\n\nShe then told him of the gyro-hat I had invented, and explained just\nwhy I had come to this place and had swallowed the strong brandy. I\ntook no part in this conversation, but Walsingham gladly agreed to\naccompany us, and he put my gyro-hat on my head.\n\nThe result was indeed marvelous. Instantly the vacuum pump began to\nwork and the gyroscope to revolve. My head, which had been lying on one\nside, straightened up. The rubber sweat band gripped my head tightly\nwith a slight pulling sensation. Without assistance I arose from my\nchair and stood erect. My brain was still confused, but I walked as\nstraight as a string direct to the door of the restaurant, and stood\nholding it open while my wife and Walsingham passed out.\n\nThe gyroscope was revolving at the rate of three thousand revolutions a\nminute, and the slight humming was hardly noticeable. I did not stagger\nand I did not reel. When I reached Gramercy Park I was full of glee. I\nhad been walking on the edge of the curb, but I now desired to climb\natop of the iron fence that surrounds the park, and walk on the points\nof the pickets.\n\nMy wife and Walsingham tried to dissuade me, but I climbed to the top\nof the fence. I not only walked on the points of the pickets easily,\nbut I was able to place the end of one toe on the point of one picket,\nand thus balanced wave the other leg in the air. My wife and Walsingham\nGribbs coaxed me to come down to the level of the walk, but as I saw no\nreason to do so, I flatly refused, and at last Walsingham reached up\nand took me by the hand and pulled me.\n\nOrdinarily a man that had imbibed a quantity of brandy would have\nfallen to the street if pulled by one hand while standing on the top\nof a row of pickets, but I did not. When Walsingham pulled my hand I\ninclined gently toward him until I was at right angles to the picket\nfence, with my feet still on top of the pickets; and when he released\nmy hand I slowly swung upright again, without any effort whatever on my\npart. I got down off that fence when I was ready, and not before.\n\nThere could be no doubt whatever that I was far more intoxicated than\nWalsingham Gribbs, and all the way home I gave vent to tremendous\nbursts of laughter over the idea that while Walsingham thought he was\nseeing me safely home I walked as straight and true as a general, and\nhe staggered and reeled except when he clung closely to my arm.\n\nMany persons stopped and looked at us, and I cannot wonder at it. For\nWalsingham is a young man of most dignified countenance, and it must\nhave seemed strange to see a young man of such sober mien reeling\ndrunkenly, while a dignified and steadily walking hatter laughed and\nshouted drunkenly. It was as if the two of us had been able to afford\nbut one spree, and had divided it in that way, he taking the stagger\nand I taking the boisterousness.\n\nMy wife was much touched by the kind attentions of Walsingham, and\nwhen we reached home she invited him in, and while I found a little\nharmless amusement in walking up the stair banisters and sliding down\nthem standing on my feet, which I was enabled to do because of the\nsteadying effect of the gyro-hat, she took Walsingham into the parlor\nand introduced him to Anne formally.\n\nMy poor daughter was quite overcome with embarrassment and pleasure,\nbut when Walsingham was sitting he showed no evidence of his stagger\nand reel whatever, and they managed to become quite well acquainted\nwhile my wife was assisting me to bed.\n\nUnfortunately I had neglected to arrange any method for letting the\nvacuum out of the gyro-hat, and although my wife tugged and pulled at\nthe hat, the suction held it fast to my head and it refused to come off\nunless my scalp came with it. My wife decided that I must sleep in the\nhat, since I was in no condition of mind to do anything about it myself.\n\nI was dying for sleep, and my wife tumbled me into bed and pulled the\nsheet over me, and that same instant I fell into a heavy slumber, but\nthe moment my wife released her grasp on me I began arising to my feet,\nirresistibly drawn to the perpendicular by the action of the gyro-hat.\nI continued to arise until I was standing upright. I can only liken the\nmanner in which I arose to the way a man might raise a stiff arm slowly\nuntil it pointed straight upward.\n\nMy wife immediately pushed me down onto the pillow again, but it was\nunavailing. Again the gyro-hat drew me to a standing position, and my\nwife was forced to let me continue my night\u2019s rest in that position.\n\nThe next morning I did not feel very well, but I never saw my wife in\nbetter spirits. She told me she was sure Walsingham had taken a great\nfancy to Anne, for he had asked permission to call again that evening,\nand my wife said that in her opinion it would be well to take up the\nmatter of the marriage with Walsingham at once, before it went any\nfurther. If he meant business he would be glad to wear the hat and be\nrid of his stagger and reel; and if he meant nothing it would be a\ngood thing to know it, and the sooner we were rid of him the better. I\nagreed with her fully, but I spent the day perfecting the vacuum outlet\non the hat.\n\nI must admit that Walsingham seemed somewhat surprised when I made\nthe suggestion to him that evening. For a few minutes he did not seem\nto know what to say. Perhaps it was a little overcoming to have the\nparents of Anne suggest the idea of a marriage in this offhand manner\nand at the same time propose the wearing of a gyro-hat; but Walsingham\nwas a gentleman, and when he glanced up, after his first surprise, and\nsaw Anne gazing at him appealingly, with her hands clasped, I could see\nthat love had won. But instead of acquiescing immediately, Walsingham\nGribbs took one of Anne\u2019s hands in his, and after patting it, spoke\ndirectly to me.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d he said, \u201cI cannot but appreciate the delicate manner in which\nyou have handled this matter, but if I am only too glad to find that\nthere is a hat that will correct my unfortunate staggering and\nreeling, and if I am glad to accept your offer of that hat, I feel it\ndue to myself to assure you that liquor has nothing whatever to do with\nmy staggering and reeling. I am the victim of an unfortunate experience\nof my youthful days.\n\n\u201cMy father was a man of many ideas, and always trying to make the world\nbetter. He had a neighbor that had a mule. It was a mouse-colored mule\nand very stubborn, and it used to wring my father\u2019s heart to see the\nneighbor belabor that mule with a heavy whip, trying to make the mule\nproceed in a direction in which it did not wish to go. The mule was\nquite willing to go toward the barn, where the feed was kept; but it\noften refused to go in the opposite direction, although it would go\nwell enough if it once started.\n\n\u201cMy father, therefore, conceived the idea of what he called the Gribbs\nMule Reverser. This was a circular platform large enough to hold a mule\nand his loaded wagon, and beneath the platform was a motor capable of\nrevolving the platform. All that was necessary was to place the mule\nand the wagon on the platform and start the mule in the direction of\nhome, and then suddenly turn the platform in the direction the mule\nwas desired to go, and the mule would proceed, unwittingly in that\ndirection.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very excellent idea,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cExcept that it would not work in the least,\u201d said Walsingham. \u201cIn the\nfirst place, it was necessary to dig a pit five feet square beneath\nthe revolving platform to contain the motor, and this was not always\nconvenient. In the second place, the platform and motor would hardly\never happen to be where the mule balked, and it would have been a great\ndeal easier to load the mule on a wagon than to load the platform and\nmotor on three wagons. And in the third place, if the mule would not\nstart homeward, neither would it start onto the platform of the Mule\nReverser.\n\n\u201cSo, after my father had tried the platform in our back yard, with a\nmule on it, and the revolutions had thrown the mule up against the\nside of the barn, breaking both the mule and the barn, he decided that\nother things were better to invent and abandoned the platform. I and\nthe lads of the neighborhood found this a good place to play, and one\nday I was standing exactly in the center of the platform when one of\nthe boys happened to start the motor. I had sense enough to remain\nexactly in the center of the platform, or I would have been thrown\noff, and possibly killed, for the platform was revolving at the rate\nof eight thousand revolutions a minute. The motor had power to revolve\nthe platform slowly when loaded with a mule and loaded wagon, so it was\ncapable of immense speed with only a small boy on it.\n\n\u201cWhen my companions saw what they had done,\u201d continued Walsingham,\n\u201cthey all ran away, and for four hours I remained in the center of that\nplatform, being revolved at an enormous speed, and when my father\ncame home and stopped the platform I staggered and reeled and fell in\na heap at his feet. That is how I acquired my unfortunate stagger and\nunpleasant reel, and I have only told you this that you may have no\nunjust suspicions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why,\u201d asked my wife, who had been greatly interested by\nWalsingham\u2019s story, \u201cdo you not revolve in the opposite direction, and\n\u2018unwind\u2019 yourself, as we used to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame,\u201d said Walsingham, \u201cI have. Every night, for one hour before I\ngo to bed I revolve, but it requires an immense number of revolutions\nto overcome such a spin as I had in my youth.\u201d He waited a moment and\nthen said: \u201cBut I am now ready to try the gyro-hat.\u201d\n\nI looked out of the window, and hesitated. A thin rain was falling, and\nwas freezing as it fell, and I hated to have a good, silk, gyro-hat go\nout into such weather; but as a leading hatter I felt that it would\nnever do for me to seem small and picayunish in regard to hats. I\nremembered that a really good silk hat should not be ruined by a few\ndrops of water; and I saw that if anything could convince Anne and\nWalsingham that the gyro-hat held their happiness, it would be a trial\non such slippery walks as the evening had provided.\n\nSo I brought down the hat and pressed it on Walsingham\u2019s head.\nInstantly the vacuum creator began to work and the hat clung fast\nto his head. He arose to his feet and walked across the parlor in a\nperfectly steady manner, and out into the hall. I held open the front\ndoor and he stepped out.\n\nWalsingham crossed the porch with as steady a tread as ever any man\ncrossed the porch of a high-class hatter, but when he reached the top\nstep his foot struck the ice and he slipped. He did not stagger nor\nreel. If he fell, he fell steadily. I can best liken his fall to the\naction of a limber reed when the wind strikes it. He inclined slowly,\nwith his feet still on the top step, and continued to incline until his\nhead touched the walk below with considerable violence, and then his\nfeet slipped down the edges of the steps until they rested on the walk.\n\nI never saw a more graceful fall, and I was about to congratulate\nWalsingham, when he began to incline toward the perpendicular again,\nin the same slow manner. But this was not the reason I held my words.\nThe reason was that the gyro-hat and Walsingham were behaving in a most\nunaccountable manner. Walsingham was revolving.\n\nI discovered later that the fall had jammed the gyroscope on the pivot\nso that the gyroscope could not revolve without revolving the whole\nhat, and as the hat was firmly suctioned to Walsingham, the hat could\nnot revolve without revolving Walsingham. For an instant Walsingham\nrevolved away from us down the walk, and Anne gave a great cry; but\nalmost at that moment Walsingham regained the upright and began to\nrevolve rapidly. The icy walk offered no purchase for his feet, and\nthis was indeed lucky; for if it had, his head would have continued to\nrevolve none the less, and the effect would have been fatal.\n\nI estimated that Walsingham was revolving at a rate of perhaps fifteen\nhundred revolutions a minute, and it was some minutes before my wife\nwas able so far to recover from the shock of seeing her prospective\nson-in-law whirl thus as to ask me to stop him. My first impulse was\nto do so, but my long training as a hatter had made me a careful,\nthoughtful man, and I gently pushed my wife back.\n\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d I said, \u201clet us pause and consider this case. Here we have\nWalsingham revolving rapidly. He is revolving in one of the only two\ndirections in which he can revolve--the direction in which he revolved\non the Mule Reverser, or the opposite direction. If it is the opposite\ndirection all is well, for he will be unwound in a few hours, if his\nneck is not wrung in the meantime. If it is in the same direction it is\nno use to stop him now, for by this time he will be in such a condition\nof reeling and staggering that we would not have him as a son-in-law on\nany terms. I propose, therefore, to let him spin here for a few hours,\nwhen he will have had a full recovery or be permanently too dizzy for\nany use.\u201d\n\nMy wife, and Anne too, saw the wisdom of this course, and as it was\nvery miserable weather outside we all withdrew to my parlor, from the\nwindow of which we could watch Walsingham revolve. Occasionally, when\nhe seemed about to revolve off the walk, I went out and pushed him on\nagain.\n\nI figured that by six o\u2019clock in the morning he would be sufficiently\nrevolved--provided he was revolving in the right direction--and at\nmidnight I sent my wife and Anne to bed. I fear Anne slept but little\nthat night, for she must have had a lover\u2019s natural anxiety as to how\nall was to turn out.\n\nAt six in the morning I called Anne and my wife, and we went into the\nyard to stop Walsingham, and it was not until I had carefully walked\ndown the porch steps that it came to me that I had no way of stopping\nhim whatever. To add to my dismay I knew that when the sun arose\nthe thin ice would melt, and as Walsingham\u2019s feet could no longer\nslip easily, he would in all probability be wrenched in two, a most\nunsatisfactory condition for a son-in-law.\n\nBut while I was standing in dismay love found a way, as love always\nwill, and Anne rushed to the cellar and brought out the stepladder and\nthe ice pick. Placing the stepladder close to Walsingham she climbed\nit, and holding the point of the ice pick at the exact center of the\ntop of the hat she pushed down. In a moment a sizzing noise told us\nthat she had bored a hole in the hat, letting the vacuum escape, and\nthe hat flew from Walsingham\u2019s head.\n\nSlower and slower he revolved, until he stood quite still, and then,\nwithout a reel or a stagger he walked up to me and grasped my hand,\nwhile tears told me the thanks he could not utter. He had revolved in\nthe right direction! He was cured!\n\n\n\nItalic text is enclosed in _underscores_.\n",
