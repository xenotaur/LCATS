JEROME COPYRIGHT, 1908, BY DODD, MEAD &\nCOMPANY Published, September, 1908\n\n\n\n\nTHE SOUL OF NICHOLAS SNYDERS, OR THE MISER OF ZANDAM\n\nOnce upon a time in Zandam, which is by the Zuider Zee, there lived a\nwicked man named Nicholas Snyders. He was mean and hard and cruel, and\nloved but one thing in the world, and that was gold. And even that\nnot for its own sake. He loved the power gold gave him--the power to\ntyrannize and to oppress, the power to cause suffering at his will.\nThey said he had no soul, but there they were wrong. All men own--or,\nto speak more correctly, are owned by--a soul; and the soul of Nicholas\nSnyders was an evil soul. He lived in the old windmill which still is\nstanding on the quay, with only little Christina to wait upon him and\nkeep house for him. Christina was an orphan whose parents had died in\ndebt. Nicholas, to Christina\u2019s everlasting gratitude, had cleared\ntheir memory--it cost but a few hundred florins--in consideration that\nChristina should work for him without wages. Christina formed his entire\nhousehold, and only one willing visitor ever darkened his door, the\nwidow Toelast. Dame Toelast was rich and almost as great a miser as\nNicholas himself. \u201cWhy should not we two marry?\u201d Nicholas had once\ncroaked to the widow Toelast. \u201cTogether we should be masters of all\nZandam.\u201d Dame Toelast had answered with a cackling laugh; but Nicholas\nwas never in haste.\n\nOne afternoon Nicholas Snyders sat alone at his desk in the centre of\nthe great semi-circular room that took up half the ground floor of the\nwindmill, and that served him for an office, and there came a knocking\nat the outer door.\n\n\u201cCome in!\u201d cried Nicholas Snyders. He spoke in a tone quite kind for\nNicholas Snyders. He felt so sure it was Jan knocking at the door--Jan\nVan der Voort, the young sailor, now master of his own ship, come to\ndemand of him the hand of little Christina. In anticipation, Nicholas\nSnyders tasted the joy of dashing Jan\u2019s hopes to the ground; of\nhearing him plead, then rave; of watching the growing pallor that\nwould overspread Jan\u2019s handsome face as Nicholas would, point by point,\nexplain to him the consequences of defiance--how, firstly, Jan\u2019s old\nmother should be turned out of her home, his old father put into prison\nfor debt; how, secondly, Jan himself should be pursued without remorse,\nhis ship be bought over his head before he could complete the purchase.\nThe interview would afford to Nicholas Snyders sport after his own soul.\nSince Jan\u2019s return the day before, he had been looking forward to it.\nTherefore, feeling sure it was Jan, he cried \u201cCome in!\u201d quite cheerily.\n\nBut it was not Jan. It was somebody Nicholas Snyders had never set eyes\non before. And neither, after that one visit, did Nicholas Snyders ever\nset eyes upon him again. The light was fading, and Nicholas Snyders was\nnot the man to light candles before they were needed, so that he was\nnever able to describe with any precision the stranger\u2019s appearance.\nNicholas thought he seemed an old man, but alert in all his movements;\nwhile his eyes--the one thing about him Nicholas saw with any\nclearness--were curiously bright and piercing.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Nicholas Snyders, taking no pains to disguise his\ndisappointment.\n\n\u201cI am a pedlar,\u201d answered the stranger. His voice was clear and not\nunmusical, with just the suspicion of roguishness behind.\n\n\u201cNot wanting anything,\u201d answered Nicholas Snyders drily. \u201cShut the door\nand be careful of the step.\u201d\n\nBut instead the stranger took a chair and drew it nearer, and, himself\nin shadow, looked straight into Nicholas Snyders\u2019 face and laughed.\n\n\u201cAre you quite sure, Nicholas Snyders? Are you quite sure there is\nnothing you require?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d growled Nicholas Snyders--\u201cexcept the sight of your back.\u201d\n The stranger bent forward, and with his long, lean hand touched Nicholas\nSnyders playfully upon the knee. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like a soul, Nicholas\nSnyders?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThink of it,\u201d continued the strange pedlar, before Nicholas could\nrecover power of speech. \u201cFor forty years you have drunk the joy of\nbeing mean and cruel. Are you not tired of the taste, Nicholas Snyders?\nWouldn\u2019t you like a change? Think of it, Nicholas Snyders--the joy of\nbeing loved, of hearing yourself blessed, instead of cursed! Wouldn\u2019t\nit be good fun, Nicholas Snyders--just by way of a change? If you don\u2019t\nlike it, you can return and be yourself again.\u201d\n\nWhat Nicholas Snyders, recalling all things afterwards, could never\nunderstand was why he sat there, listening in patience to the stranger\u2019s\ntalk; for, at the time, it seemed to him the jesting of a wandering\nfool. But something about the stranger had impressed him.\n\n\u201cI have it with me,\u201d continued the odd pedlar; \u201cand as for price--\u201d The\nstranger made a gesture indicating dismissal of all sordid details.\n\u201cI look for my reward in watching the result of the experiment. I am\nsomething of a philosopher. I take an interest in these matters. See.\u201d\n The stranger dived between his legs and produced from his pack a silver\nflask of cunning workmanship and laid it on the table.\n\n\u201cIts flavour is not unpleasant,\u201d explained the stranger. \u201cA little\nbitter; but one does not drink it by the goblet: a wineglassful, such\nas one would of old Tokay, while the mind of both is fixed on the\nsame thought: \u2018May my soul pass into him, may his pass into me!\u2019\nThe operation is quite simple: the secret lies within the drug.\u201d The\nstranger patted the quaint flask as though it had been some little dog.\n\n\u201cYou will say: \u2018Who will exchange souls with Nicholas Snyders?\u2019\u201d The\nstranger appeared to have come prepared with an answer to all questions.\n\u201cMy friend, you are rich; you need not fear. It is the possession\nmen value the least of all they have. Choose your soul and drive your\nbargain. I leave that to you with one word of counsel only: you will\nfind the young readier than the old--the young, to whom the world\npromises all things for gold. Choose you a fine, fair, fresh, young\nsoul, Nicholas Snyders; and choose it quickly. Your hair is somewhat\ngrey, my friend. Taste, before you die, the joy of living.\u201d\n\nThe strange pedlar laughed and, rising, closed his pack. Nicholas\nSnyders neither moved nor spoke, until with the soft clanging of the\nmassive door his senses returned to him. Then, seizing the flask the\nstranger had left behind him, he sprang from his chair, meaning to fling\nit after him into the street. But the flashing of the firelight on its\nburnished surface stayed his hand.\n\n\u201cAfter all, the case is of value,\u201d Nicholas chuckled, and put the flask\naside and, lighting the two tall candles, buried himself again in his\ngreen-bound ledger. Yet still from time to time Nicholas Snyders\u2019 eye\nwould wander to where the silver flask remained half hidden among dusty\npapers. And later there came again a knocking at the door, and this time\nit really was young Jan who entered.\n\nJan held out his great hand across the littered desk.\n\n\u201cWe parted in anger, Nicholas Snyders. It was my fault. You were in the\nright. I ask you to forgive me. I was poor. It was selfish of me to\nwish the little maid to share with me my poverty. But now I am no longer\npoor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d responded Nicholas in kindly tone. \u201cI have heard of it. So\nnow you are master and the owner of your ship--your very own.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy very own after one more voyage,\u201d laughed Jan. \u201cI have Burgomaster\nAllart\u2019s promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cA promise is not a performance,\u201d hinted Nicholas. \u201cBurgomaster Allart\nis not a rich man; a higher bid might tempt him. Another might step in\nbetween you and become the owner.\u201d\n\nJan only laughed. \u201cWhy, that would be the work of an enemy, which, God\nbe praised, I do not think that I possess.\u201d\n\n\u201cLucky lad!\u201d commented Nicholas; \u201cso few of us are without enemies. And\nyour parents, Jan, will they live with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wished it,\u201d answered Jan, \u201cboth Christina and I. But the mother is\nfeeble. The old mill has grown into her life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can understand,\u201d agreed Nicholas. \u201cThe old vine torn from the old\nwall withers. And your father, Jan; people will gossip. The mill is\npaying?\u201d\n\nJan shook his head. \u201cIt never will again; and the debts haunt him. But\nall that, as I tell him, is a thing of the past. His creditors have\nagreed to look to me and wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of them?\u201d queried Nicholas.\n\n\u201cAll of them I could discover,\u201d laughed Jan.\n\nNicholas Snyders pushed back his chair and looked at Jan with a smile\nupon his wrinkled face. \u201cAnd so you and Christina have arranged it all?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith your consent, sir,\u201d answered Jan.\n\n\u201cYou will wait for that?\u201d asked Nicholas.\n\n\u201cWe should like to have it, sir.\u201d Jan smiled, but the tone of his voice\nfell agreeably on Nicholas Snyders\u2019 ear. Nicholas Snyders loved best\nbeating the dog that, growled and showed its teeth.\n\n\u201cBetter not wait for that,\u201d said Nicholas Snyders. \u201cYou might have to\nwait long.\u201d\n\nJan rose, an angry flush upon his face. \u201cSo nothing changes you,\nNicholas Snyders. Have it your own way, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will marry her in spite of me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn spite of you and of your friends the fiends, and of your master the\nDevil!\u201d flung out Jan. For Jan had a soul that was generous and brave\nand tender and excessively short-tempered. Even the best of souls have\ntheir failings.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d said old Nicholas.\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear it,\u201d answered Jan.\n\n\u201cI am sorry for your mother,\u201d explained Nicholas. \u201cThe poor dame, I\nfear, will be homeless in her old age. The mortgage shall be foreclosed,\nJan, on your wedding-day. I am sorry for your father, Jan. His\ncreditors, Jan--you have overlooked just one. I am sorry for him, Jan.\nPrison has always been his dread. I am sorry even for you, my young\nfriend. You will have to begin life over again. Burgomaster Allart is in\nthe hollow of my hand. I have but to say the word, your ship is mine.\nI wish you joy of your bride, my young friend. You must love her very\ndearly--you will be paying a high price for her.\u201d\n\nIt was Nicholas Snyders\u2019 grin that maddened Jan. He sought for something\nthat, thrown straight at the wicked mouth, should silence it, and\nby chance his hand lighted on the pedlar\u2019s silver flask. In the same\ninstance Nicholas Snyders\u2019 hand had closed upon it also. The grin had\ndied away.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d commanded Nicholas Snyders. \u201cLet us talk further.\u201d And there\nwas that in his voice that compelled the younger man\u2019s obedience.\n\n\u201cYou wonder, Jan, why I seek always anger and hatred. I wonder at times\nmyself. Why do generous thoughts never come to me, as to other men!\nListen, Jan; I am in a whimsical mood. Such things cannot be, but it is\na whim of mine to think it might have been. Sell me your soul, Jan, sell\nme your soul, that I, too, may taste this love and gladness that I hear\nabout. For a little while, Jan, only for a little while, and I will give\nyou all you desire.\u201d\n\nThe old man seized his pen and wrote.\n\n\u201cSee, Jan, the ship is yours beyond mishap; the mill goes free; your\nfather may hold up his head again. And all I ask, Jan, is that you drink\nto me, willing the while that your soul may go from you and become the\nsoul of old Nicholas Snyders--for a little while, Jan, only for a little\nwhile.\u201d\n\nWith feverish hands the old man had drawn the stopper from the pedlar\u2019s\nflagon, had poured the wine into twin glasses. Jan\u2019s inclination was to\nlaugh, but the old man\u2019s eagerness was almost frenzy. Surely he was mad;\nbut that would not make less binding the paper he had signed. A true man\ndoes not jest with his soul, but the face of Christina was shining down\non Jan from out the gloom.\n\n\u201cYou will mean it?\u201d whispered Nicholas Snyders.\n\n\u201cMay my soul pass from me and enter into Nicholas Snyders!\u201d answered\nJan, replacing his empty glass upon the table. And the two stood looking\nfor a moment into one another\u2019s eyes.\n\nAnd the high candles on the littered desk flickered and went out, as\nthough a breath had blown them, first one and then the other.\n\n\u201cI must be getting home,\u201d came the voice of Jan from the darkness. \u201cWhy\ndid you blow out the candles?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can light them again from the fire,\u201d answered Nicholas. He did not\nadd that he had meant to ask that same question of Jan. He thrust them\namong the glowing logs, first one and then the other; and the shadows\ncrept back into their corners.\n\n\u201cYou will not stop and see Christina?\u201d asked Nicholas.\n\n\u201cNot to-night,\u201d answered Jan.\n\n\u201cThe paper that I signed,\u201d Nicholas reminded him--\u201cyou have it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had forgotten it,\u201d Jan answered.\n\nThe old man took it from the desk and handed it to him. Jan thrust it\ninto his pocket and went out. Nicholas bolted the door behind him and\nreturned to his desk; sat long there, his elbow resting on the open\nledger.\n\nNicholas pushed the ledger aside and laughed. \u201cWhat foolery! As if such\nthings could be! The fellow must have bewitched me.\u201d\n\nNicholas crossed to the fire and warmed his hands before the blaze.\n\u201cStill, I am glad he is going to marry the little lass. A good lad, a\ngood lad.\u201d\n\nNicholas must have fallen asleep before the fire. When he opened his\neyes, it was to meet the grey dawn. He felt cold, stiff, hungry, and\ndecidedly cross. Why had not Christina woke him up and given him his\nsupper. Did she think he had intended to pass the night on a wooden\nchair? The girl was an idiot. He would go upstairs and tell her through\nthe door just what he thought of her.\n\nHis way upstairs led through the kitchen. To his astonishment, there sat\nChristina, asleep before the burnt-out grate.\n\n\u201cUpon my word,\u201d muttered Nicholas to himself, \u201cpeople in this house\ndon\u2019t seem to know what beds are for!\u201d\n\nBut it was not Christina, so Nicholas told himself. Christina had the\nlook of a frightened rabbit: it had always irritated him. This girl,\neven in her sleep, wore an impertinent expression--a delightfully\nimpertinent expression. Besides, this girl was pretty--marvellously\npretty. Indeed, so pretty a girl Nicholas had never seen in all his life\nbefore. Why had the girls, when Nicholas was young, been so entirely\ndifferent! A sudden bitterness seized Nicholas: it was as though he had\njust learnt that long ago, without knowing it, he had been robbed.\n\nThe child must be cold. Nicholas fetched his fur-lined cloak and wrapped\nit about her.\n\nThere was something else he ought to do. The idea came to him while\ndrawing the cloak around her shoulders, very gently, not to disturb\nher--something he wanted to do, if only he could think what it was. The\ngirl\u2019s lips were parted. She appeared to be speaking to him, asking him\nto do this thing--or telling him not to do it. Nicholas could not be\nsure which. Half a dozen times he turned away, and half a dozen times\nstole back to where she sat sleeping with that delightfully impertinent\nexpression on her face, her lips parted. But what she wanted, or what it\nwas he wanted, Nicholas could not think.\n\nPerhaps Christina would know. Perhaps Christina would know who she was\nand how she got there. Nicholas climbed the stairs, swearing at them for\ncreaking.\n\nChristina\u2019s door was open. No one was in the room; the bed had not been\nslept upon. Nicholas descended the creaking stairs.\n\nThe girl was still asleep. Could it be Christina herself? Nicholas\nexamined the delicious features one by one. Never before, so far as he\ncould recollect, had he seen the girl; yet around her neck--Nicholas had\nnot noticed it before--lay Christina\u2019s locket, rising and falling as she\nbreathed. Nicholas knew it well; the one thing belonging to her mother\nChristina had insisted on keeping. The one thing about which she had\never defied him. She would never have parted with that locket. It must\nbe Christina herself. But what had happened to her? Or to himself.\nRemembrance rushed in upon him. The odd pedlar! The scene with Jan! But\nsurely all that had been a dream? Yet there upon the littered desk still\nstood the pedlar\u2019s silver flask, together with the twin stained glasses.\n\nNicholas tried to think, but his brain was in a whirl. A ray of sunshine\nstreaming through the window fell across the dusty room. Nicholas had\nnever seen the sun, that he could recollect. Involuntarily he stretched\nhis hands towards it, felt a pang of grief when it vanished, leaving\nonly the grey light. He drew the rusty bolts, flung open the great door.\nA strange world lay before him, a new world of lights and shadows, that\nwooed him with their beauty--a world of low, soft voices that called to\nhim. There came to him again that bitter sense of having been robbed.\n\n\u201cI could have been so happy all these years,\u201d murmured old Nicholas to\nhimself. \u201cIt is just the little town I could have loved--so quaint, so\nquiet, so homelike. I might have had friends, old cronies, children of\nmy own maybe--\u201d\n\nA vision of the sleeping Christina flashed before his eyes. She had come\nto him a child, feeling only gratitude towards him. Had he had eyes with\nwhich to see her, all things might have been different.\n\nWas it too late? He is not so old--not so very old. New life is in his\nveins. She still loves Jan, but that was the Jan of yesterday. In the\nfuture, Jan\u2019s every word and deed will be prompted by the evil soul that\nwas once the soul of Nicholas Snyders--that Nicholas Snyders remembers\nwell. Can any woman love that, let the case be as handsome as you will?\n\nOught he, as an honest man, to keep the soul he had won from Jan by what\nmight be called a trick? Yes, it had been a fair bargain, and Jan had\ntaken his price. Besides, it was not as if Jan had fashioned his own\nsoul; these things are chance. Why should one man be given gold, and\nanother be given parched peas? He has as much right to Jan\u2019s soul as Jan\never had. He is wiser, he can do more good with it. It was Jan\u2019s soul\nthat loved Christina; let Jan\u2019s soul win her if it can. And Jan\u2019s\nsoul, listening to the argument, could not think of a word to offer in\nopposition.\n\nChristina was still asleep when Nicholas re-entered the kitchen. He\nlighted the fire and cooked the breakfast and then aroused her gently.\nThere was no doubt it was Christina. The moment her eyes rested on old\nNicholas, there came back to her the frightened rabbit look that had\nalways irritated him. It irritated him now, but the irritation was\nagainst himself.\n\n\u201cYou were sleeping so soundly when I came in last night--\u201d Christina\ncommenced.\n\n\u201cAnd you were afraid to wake me,\u201d Nicholas interrupted her. \u201cYou thought\nthe old curmudgeon would be cross. Listen, Christina. You paid off\nyesterday the last debt your father owed. It was to an old sailor--I had\nnot been able to find him before. Not a cent more do you owe, and\nthere remains to you, out of your wages, a hundred florins. It is yours\nwhenever you like to ask me for it.\u201d\n\nChristina could not understand, neither then nor during the days that\nfollowed; nor did Nicholas enlighten her. For the soul of Jan had\nentered into a very wise old man, who knew that the best way to live\ndown the past is to live boldly the present. All that Christina could\nbe sure of was that the old Nicholas Snyders had mysteriously vanished,\nthat in his place remained a new Nicholas, who looked at her with kindly\neyes--frank and honest, compelling confidence. Though Nicholas never\nsaid so, it came to Christina that she herself, her sweet example, her\nennobling influence it was that had wrought this wondrous change. And to\nChristina the explanation seemed not impossible--seemed even pleasing.\n\nThe sight of his littered desk was hateful to him. Starting early in the\nmorning, Nicholas would disappear for the entire day, returning in the\nevening tired but cheerful, bringing with him flowers that Christina\nlaughed at, telling him they were weeds. But what mattered names? To\nNicholas they were beautiful. In Zandam the children ran from him,\nthe dogs barked after him. So Nicholas, escaping through byways, would\nwander far into the country. Children in the villages around came to\nknow a kind old fellow who loved to linger, his hands resting on his\nstaff, watching their play, listening to their laughter; whose ample\npockets were storehouses of good things. Their elders, passing by, would\nwhisper to one another how like he was in features to wicked old Nick,\nthe miser of Zandam, and would wonder where he came from. Nor was\nit only the faces of the children that taught his lips to smile. It\ntroubled him at first to find the world so full of marvellously pretty\ngirls--of pretty women also, all more or less lovable. It bewildered\nhim. Until he found that, notwithstanding, Christina remained always\nin his thoughts the prettiest, the most lovable of them all. Then every\npretty face rejoiced him: it reminded him of Christina.\n\nOn his return the second day, Christina had met him with sadness in her\neyes. Farmer Beerstraater, an old friend of her father\u2019s, had called to\nsee Nicholas; not finding Nicholas, had talked a little with Christina.\nA hardhearted creditor was turning him out of his farm. Christina\npretended not to know that the creditor was Nicholas himself, but\nmarvelled that such wicked men could be. Nicholas said nothing, but the\nnext day Farmer Beerstraater had called again, all smiles, blessings,\nand great wonder.\n\n\u201cBut what can have come to him?\u201d repeated Farmer Beerstraater over and\nover.\n\nChristina had smiled and answered that perhaps the good God had touched\nhis heart; but thought to herself that perhaps it had been the good\ninfluence of another. The tale flew. Christina found herself besieged on\nevery hand, and, finding her intercessions invariably successful, grew\nday by day more pleased with herself, and by consequence more pleased\nwith Nicholas Snyders. For Nicholas was a cunning old gentleman. Jan\u2019s\nsoul in him took delight in undoing the evil the soul of Nicholas\nhad wrought. But the brain of Nicholas Snyders that remained to him\nwhispered: \u201cLet the little maid think it is all her doing.\u201d\n\nThe news reached the ears of Dame Toelast. The same evening saw her\nseated in the inglenook opposite Nicholas Snyders, who smoked and seemed\nbored.\n\n\u201cYou are making a fool of yourself, Nicholas Snyders,\u201d the Dame told\nhim. \u201cEverybody is laughing at you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had rather they laughed than cursed me,\u201d growled Nicholas.\n\n\u201cHave you forgotten all that has passed between us?\u201d demanded the Dame.\n\n\u201cWish I could,\u201d sighed Nicholas.\n\n\u201cAt your age--\u201d commenced the Dame.\n\n\u201cI am feeling younger than I ever felt in all my life,\u201d Nicholas\ninterrupted her.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look it,\u201d commented the Dame.\n\n\u201cWhat do looks matter?\u201d snapped Nicholas. \u201cIt is the soul of a man that\nis the real man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey count for something, as the world goes,\u201d explained the Dame. \u201cWhy,\nif I liked to follow your example and make a fool of myself, there are\nyoung men, fine young men, handsome young men--\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let me stand in your way,\u201d interposed Nicholas quickly. \u201cAs you\nsay, I am old and I have a devil of a temper. There must be many better\nmen than I am, men more worthy of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t say there are not,\u201d returned the Dame: \u201cbut nobody more\nsuitable. Girls for boys, and old women for old men. I haven\u2019t lost my\nwits, Nicholas Snyders, if you have. When you are yourself again--\u201d\n\nNicholas Snyders sprang to his feet. \u201cI am myself,\u201d he cried, \u201cand\nintend to remain myself! Who dares say I am not myself?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d retorted the Dame with exasperating coolness. \u201cNicholas Snyders\nis not himself when at the bidding of a pretty-faced doll he flings his\nmoney out of the window with both hands. He is a creature bewitched, and\nI am sorry for him. She\u2019ll fool you for the sake of her friends till\nyou haven\u2019t a cent left, and then she\u2019ll laugh at you. When you are\nyourself, Nicholas Snyders, you will be crazy with yourself--remember\nthat.\u201d And Dame Toelast marched out and slammed the door behind her.\n\n\u201cGirls for boys, and old women for old men.\u201d The phrase kept ringing in\nhis ears. Hitherto his new-found happiness had filled his life, leaving\nno room for thought. But the old Dame\u2019s words had sown the seed of\nreflection.\n\nWas Christina fooling him? The thought was impossible. Never once had\nshe pleaded for herself, never once for Jan. The evil thought was the\ncreature of Dame Toelast\u2019s evil mind. Christina loved him. Her face\nbrightened at his coming. The fear of him had gone out of her; a pretty\ntyranny had replaced it. But was it the love that he sought? Jan\u2019s soul\nin old Nick\u2019s body was young and ardent. It desired Christina not as a\ndaughter, but as a wife. Could it win her in spite of old Nick\u2019s body?\nThe soul of Jan was an impatient soul. Better to know than to doubt.\n\n\u201cDo not light the candles; let us talk a little by the light of the fire\nonly,\u201d said Nicholas. And Christina, smiling, drew her chair towards the\nblaze. But Nicholas sat in the shadow.\n\n\u201cYou grow more beautiful every day, Christina,\u201d said Nicholas-\u201csweeter\nand more womanly. He will be a happy man who calls you wife.\u201d\n\nThe smile passed from Christina\u2019s face. \u201cI shall never marry,\u201d she\nanswered. \u201cNever is a long word, little one.\u201d\n\n\u201cA true woman does not marry the man she does not love.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut may she not marry the man she does?\u201d smiled Nicholas.\n\n\u201cSometimes she may not,\u201d Christina explained.\n\n\u201cAnd when is that?\u201d\n\nChristina\u2019s face was turned away. \u201cWhen he has ceased to love her.\u201d\n\nThe soul in old Nick\u2019s body leapt with joy. \u201cHe is not worthy of you,\nChristina. His new fortune has changed him. Is it not so? He thinks only\nof money. It is as though the soul of a miser had entered into him.\nHe would marry even Dame Toelast for the sake of her gold-bags and her\nbroad lands and her many mills, if only she would have him. Cannot you\nforget him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall never forget him. I shall never love another man. I try to hide\nit; and often I am content to find there is so much in the world that\nI can do. But my heart is breaking.\u201d She rose and, kneeling beside him,\nclasped her hands around him. \u201cI am glad you have let me tell you,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cBut for you I could not have borne it. You are so good to me.\u201d\n\nFor answer he stroked with his withered hand the golden hair that fell\ndisordered about his withered knees. She raised her eyes to him; they\nwere filled with tears, but smiling.\n\n\u201cI cannot understand,\u201d she said. \u201cI think sometimes that you and he must\nhave changed souls. He is hard and mean and cruel, as you used to be.\u201d\n She laughed, and the arms around him tightened for a moment. \u201cAnd now\nyou are kind and tender and great, as once he was. It is as if the good\nGod had taken away my lover from me to give to me a father.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to me, Christina,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the soul that is the man, not\nthe body. Could you not love me for my new soul?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I do love you,\u201d answered Christina, smiling through her tears.\n\n\u201cCould you as a husband?\u201d The firelight fell upon her face. Nicholas,\nholding it between his withered hands, looked into it long and hard; and\nreading what he read there, laid it back against his breast and soothed\nit with his withered hand.\n\n\u201cI was jesting, little one,\u201d he said. \u201cGirls for boys, and old women for\nold men. And so, in spite of all, you still love Jan?\u201d\n\n\u201cI love him,\u201d answered Christina. \u201cI cannot help it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if he would, you would marry him, let his soul be what it may?\u201d\n\n\u201cI love him,\u201d answered Christina. \u201cI cannot help it.\u201d\n\nOld Nicholas sat alone before the dying fire. Is it the soul or the body\nthat is the real man? The answer was not so simple as he had thought it.\n\n\u201cChristina loved Jan\u201d--so Nicholas mumbled to the dying fire--\u201cwhen\nhe had the soul of Jan. She loves him still, though he has the soul of\nNicholas Snyders. When I asked her if she could love me, it was terror\nI read in her eyes, though Jan\u2019s soul is now in me; she divined it. It\nmust be the body that is the real Jan, the real Nicholas. If the soul\nof Christina entered into the body of Dame Toelast, should I turn from\nChristina, from her golden hair, her fathomless eyes, her asking lips,\nto desire the shrivelled carcass of Dame Toelast? No; I should still\nshudder at the thought of her. Yet when I had the soul of Nicholas\nSnyders, I did not loathe her, while Christina was naught to me. It must\nbe with the soul that we love, else Jan would still love Christina and\nI should be Miser Nick. Yet here am I loving Christina, using Nicholas\nSnyders\u2019 brain and gold to thwart Nicholas Snyders\u2019 every scheme, doing\neverything that I know will make him mad when he comes back into his own\nbody; while Jan cares no longer for Christina, would marry Dame Toelast\nfor her broad lands, her many mills. Clearly it is the soul that is the\nreal man. Then ought I not to be glad, thinking I am going back into my\nown body, knowing that I shall wed Christina? But I am not glad; I am\nvery miserable. I shall not go with Jan\u2019s soul, I feel it; my own soul\nwill come back to me. I shall be again the hard, cruel, mean old man I\nwas before, only now I shall be poor and helpless. The folks will laugh\nat me, and I shall curse them, powerless to do them evil. Even Dame\nToelast will not want me when she learns all. And yet I must do this\nthing. So long as Jan\u2019s soul is in me, I love Christina better than\nmyself. I must do this for her sake. I love her--I cannot help it.\u201d\n\nOld Nicholas rose, took from the place, where a month before he had\nhidden it, the silver flask of cunning workmanship.\n\n\u201cJust two more glassfuls left,\u201d mused Nicholas, as he gently shook the\nflask against his ear. He laid it on the desk before him, then opened\nonce again the old green ledger, for there still remained work to be\ndone.\n\nHe woke Christina early. \u201cTake these letters, Christina,\u201d he commanded.\n\u201cWhen you have delivered them all, but not before, go to Jan; tell him\nI am waiting here to see him on a matter of business.\u201d He kissed her and\nseemed loth to let her go.\n\n\u201cI shall only be a little while,\u201d smiled Christina.\n\n\u201cAll partings take but a little while,\u201d he answered.\n\nOld Nicholas had foreseen the trouble he would have. Jan was content,\nhad no desire to be again a sentimental young fool, eager to saddle\nhimself with a penniless wife. Jan had other dreams.\n\n\u201cDrink, man, drink!\u201d cried Nicholas impatiently, \u201cbefore I am tempted to\nchange my mind. Christina, provided you marry her, is the richest bride\nin Zandam. There is the deed; read it; and read quickly.\u201d\n\nThen Jan consented, and the two men drank. And there passed a breath\nbetween them as before; and Jan with his hands covered his eyes a\nmoment.\n\nIt was a pity, perhaps, that he did so, for in that moment Nicholas\nsnatched at the deed that lay beside Jan on the desk. The next instant\nit was blazing in the fire.\n\n\u201cNot so poor as you thought!\u201d came the croaking voice of Nicholas. \u201cNot\nso poor as you thought! I can build again, I can build again!\u201d And the\ncreature, laughing hideously, danced with its withered arms spread out\nbefore the blaze, lest Jan should seek to rescue Christina\u2019s burning\ndowry before it was destroyed.\n\nJan did not tell Christina. In spite of all Jan could say, she would go\nback. Nicholas Snyders drove her from the door with curses. She could\nnot understand. The only thing clear was that Jan had come back to her.\n\n\u201c\u2018Twas a strange madness that seized upon me,\u201d Jan explained. \u201cLet the\ngood sea breezes bring us health.\u201d\n\nSo from the deck of Jan\u2019s ship they watched old Zandam till it vanished\ninto air.\n\nChristina cried a little at the thought of never seeing it again; but\nJan comforted her and later new faces hid the old.\n\nAnd old Nicholas married Dame Toelast, but, happily, lived to do evil\nonly for a few years longer.\n\nLong after, Jan told Christina the whole story, but it sounded very\nimprobable, and Christina--though, of course, she did not say so--did\nnot quite believe it, but thought Jan was trying to explain away that\nstrange month of his life during which he had wooed Dame Toelast. Yet it\ncertainly was strange that Nicholas, for the same short month, had been\nso different from his usual self.\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d thought Christina, \u201cif I had not told him I loved Jan, he\nwould not have gone back to his old ways. Poor old gentleman! No doubt\nit was despair.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",
