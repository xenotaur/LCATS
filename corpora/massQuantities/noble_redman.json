    "body": "A pair of words I heartily detest are _noble_ and _redman_,\nparticularly when they occur together. Some of my egghead friends from\nthe Hub tell me that I shouldn't, since they're merely an ancient\ncolloquialism used to describe a race of aborigines on the American\nland mass.\n\nThe American land mass? Where? Why--on Earth, of course--where would\nancestors come from? Yes--I know it's not nice to mention that word.\nIt's an obscenity. No one likes to be reminded that his ancestors came\nfrom there. It's like calling a man a son of a sloat. But it's the\ntruth. Our ancestors came from Earth and nothing we can do is going to\nchange it. And despite the fact that we're the rulers of a good sized\nsegment of the galaxy, we're nothing but transplanted Earthmen.\n\nI suppose I'm no better than most of the citizens you find along the\nperipheral strips of Martian dome cities. But I might have been if it\nhadn't been for Noble Redman. No--not _the_ noble redman--just Noble\nRedman. It's a name, not a description, although as a description his\nsurname could apply, since he _was_ red. His skin was red, his hair\nwas red, his eyes had reddish flecks in their irises, and their whites\nwere red like they were inflamed. Even his teeth had a reddish tinge.\nDamndest guy I ever saw. Redman was descriptive enough--but Noble! Ha!\nthat character had all the nobility of a Sand Nan--.\n\nI met him in Marsport. I was fairly well-heeled, having just finished\nguiding a couple of Centaurian tourists through the ruins of K'nar.\nThey didn't believe me when I told them to watch out for Sand Nans.\nClaimed that there were no such things. They were kinda violent about\nit. Superstition--they said. So when the Nan heaved itself up out of\nthe sand, they weren't ready at all. They froze long enough for it to\nget in two shots with its stingers. They were paralyzed of course, but\nI wasn't, and a Nan isn't quick enough to hit a running target. So I\nwas out of range when the Nan turned its attention to the Centaurians\nand started to feed. I took a few pictures of the Nan finishing off\nthe second tourist--the female one. It wasn't very pretty, but you\nlearn to keep a camera handy when you're a guide. It gets you out of\nall sorts of legal complications later. The real bad thing about it\nwas that the woman must have gotten stuck with an unripe stinger\nbecause she didn't go quietly like her mate. She kept screaming right\nup to the end. I felt bad about it, but there wasn't anything I could\ndo. You don't argue with a Nan without a blaster, and the Park Service\ndoesn't allow weapons in Galactic Parks.\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that I had our conversation on tape and pictures to\nprove what happened, the Park cops took a dim view of the whole\naffair. They cancelled my license, but what the hell--I wasn't cut out\nfor a guide. So when I got back to Marsport, I put in a claim for my\nfee, and since their money had gone into the Nan with them, the Claims\nCourt allowed that I had the right to garnishee the deceaseds'\npersonal property, which I did. So I was richer by one Starflite class\nyacht, a couple of hundred ounces of industrial gold, and a lot of\npersonal effects which I sold to Abe Feldstein for a hundred and fifty\nmunits.\n\nAbe wasn't very generous, but what's a Martian to do with Centaurian\ngear? Nothing those midgets use is adaptable to us. Even their yacht,\na six passenger job, would barely hold three normal-sized people and\nthey'd be cramped as kampas in a can. But the hull and drives were in\ngood shape and I figured that if I sunk a couple of thousand munits\ninto remodelling, the ship'd sell for at least twenty thousand--if I\ncould find someone who wanted a three passenger job. That was the\nproblem.\n\nAbe offered me five thousand for her as she stood--but I wasn't having\nany--at least not until I'd gotten rid of the gold in her fuel reels.\nThat stuff's worth money to the spacelines--about fifty munits per\nounce. It's better even than lead as fuel--doesn't clog the tubes and\ngives better acceleration.\n\nWell--like I said--I was flusher than I had been since Triworld\nFreight Lines ran afoul of the cops on Callisto for smuggling tekla\nnuts. So I went down to Otto's place on the strip to wash some of that\nDryland dust off my tonsils. And that's where I met Redman.\n\nHe came up the street from the South airlock--a big fellow--walking\nkinda unsteady, his respirator hanging from his thick neck. He was\nburned a dark reddish black from the Dryland sun and looked like he\nwas on his last legs when he turned into Otto's. He staggered up to\nthe bar.\n\n\"Water,\" he said.\n\nOtto passed him a pitcher and damned if the guy didn't drink it\nstraight down!\n\n\"That'll be ten munits,\" Otto said.\n\n\"For water?\" the man asked.\n\n\"You're on Mars,\" Otto reminded him.\n\n\"Oh,\" the big fellow said, and jerked a few lumps of yellow metal out\nof a pocket and dropped it on the bar. \"Will this do?\" he asked.\n\n\n\nOtto's eyes damn near bulged out of their sockets. \"Where'd you get\nthat stuff?\" he demanded. \"That's gold!\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"It'll do fine.\" Otto picked out a piece that musta weighed an ounce.\n\"Have another pitcher.\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" the big fellow said. \"Keep the change.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" You'da thought from Otto's voice that he was talking to\nthe Prince Regent. \"Just _where_ did you say you found it.\"\n\n\"I didn't say. But I found it out there.\" He waved a thick arm in the\ndirection of the Drylands.\n\nBy this time a couple of sharpies sitting at one of the tables pricked\nup their ears, removed their pants from their chairs and began closing\nin. But I beat them to it.\n\n\"My name's Wallingford,\" I said. \"Cyril Wallingford.\"\n\n\"So what?\" he snaps.\n\n\"So if you don't watch out you'll be laying in an alley with all that\nnice yellow stuff in someone else's pocket.\"\n\n\"I can take care of myself,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't doubt it,\" I said, looking at the mass of him. He was sure\nking-sized. \"But even a guy as big as you is cold meat for a little\nguy with a Kelly.\"\n\nHe looked at me a bit more friendly. \"Maybe I'm wrong about you,\nfriend. But you look shifty.\"\n\n\"I'll admit my face isn't my fortune,\" I said sticking out what little\nchin I had and looking indignant. \"But I'm honest. Ask anyone here.\" I\nlooked around. There were three men in the place I didn't have\nsomething on, and I was faster than they. I was a fair hand with a\nKelly in those days and I had a reputation. There was a chorus of nods\nand the big fellow looked satisfied. He stuck out a hamsized hand.\n\n\"Me name's Redman,\" he said. \"Noble Redman. My father had a sense of\nhumor.\" He grinned at me, giving me a good view of his pink teeth.\n\nI grinned back. \"Glad to know you,\" I replied. I gave the sharpies a\nhard look and they moved off and left us alone. The big fellow\ninterested me. Fact is--anyone with money interested me--but I'm not\nstupid greedy. It took me about three minutes to spot him for a phony.\nAnyone who's lived out in the Drylands knows that there just _isn't_\nany gold there. Iron, sure, the whole desert's filthy with it, but if\nthere is anything higher on the periodic table than the rare earths,\nnobody had found it yet--and this guy with his light clothes, street\nboots and low capacity respirator--Hell! he couldn't stay out there\nmore than two days if he wanted to--and besides, the gold was refined.\nThe lumps looked like they were cut off something bigger--a bar, for\ninstance.\n\n\n\nA bar!--a bar of gold! My brain started working. K'nar was about two\ndays out, and there had always been rumors about Martian gold even\nthough no one ever found any. Maybe this tourist had come through. If\nso, he was worth cultivating. For he was a tourist. He certainly\nwasn't a citizen. There wasn't a Martian alive with a skin like his.\nRedman--the name fitted all right. But what was his game? I couldn't\nfigure it. And the more I tried the less I succeeded. It was a\ncertainty he was no prospector despite his burned skin. His hands gave\nhim away. They were big and dirty, but the pink nails were smooth and\nthe red palms soft and uncalloused. There wasn't even a blister on\nthem. He could have been fresh from the Mercury Penal Colony--but\nthose guys were burned black--not red, and he didn't have the hangdog\nlook of an ex-con.\n\nHe talked about prospecting on Callisto--looking for heavy metals. Ha!\nThere were fewer heavy metals on Callisto than there were on Mars. But\nhe had listeners. His gold and the way he spent it drew them like\nhoney draws flies. But finally I got the idea. Somehow, subtly, he\nturned the conversation around to gambling which was a subject\neveryone knew. That brought up tales of the old games, poker, faro,\nthree card monte, blackjack, roulette--and crapshooting.\n\n\"I'll bet there isn't a dice game in town.\" Redman said.\n\n\"You'd lose,\" I answered. I had about all this maneuvering I could\ntake. Bring it out in the open--see what this guy was after. Maybe I\ncould get something out of it in the process. From the looks of his\nhands he was a pro. He could probably make dice and cards sing sweet\nmusic, and if he could I wanted to be with him when he did. The more I\nlistened, the more I was sure he was setting something up.\n\n\"Where is this game?\" he asked incuriously.\n\n\"Over Abie Feldstein's hock-shop,\" I said. \"But it's private. You have\nto know someone to get in.\"\n\n\"You steering for it?\" He asked.\n\nI shook my head, half puzzled. I wasn't quite certain what he meant.\n\n\"Are you touting for the game?\" he asked.\n\nThe light dawned. But the terms he used! Archaic was the only word for\nthem!\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I'm not fronting for Abie. Fact is, if you want some\nfriendly advice, stay outa there.\"\n\n\"Why--the game crooked?\"\n\nThere it was again, the old fashioned word. \"Yes, it's bowed,\" I said.\n\"It's bowed like a sine wave--in both directions. Honesty isn't one of\nAbie's best policies.\"\n\nHe suddenly looked eager. \"Can I get in?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not through me. I have no desire to watch a slaughter of the\ninnocent. Hang onto your gold, Redman. It's safer.\" I kept watching\nhim. His face smoothed out into an expressionless mask--a gambler's\nface. \"But if you're really anxious, there's one of Abie's fronts just\ncoming in the door. Ask him, if you want to lose your shirt.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Redman said.\n\nI didn't wait to see what happened. I left Otto's and laid a\ncourseline for Abie's. I wanted to be there before Redman arrived. Not\nonly did I want an alibi, but I'd be in better position to sit in.\nAlso I didn't want a couple of Abie's goons on my neck just in case\nRedman won. There was no better way to keep from getting old than to\nwin too many munits in Abie's games.\n\n\n\nI'd already given Abie back fifty of the hundred and fifty he'd paid\nme for the Centaurians' gear, and was starting in on the hundred when\nRedman walked in flanked by the frontman. He walked straight back to\nthe dice table and stood beside it, watching the play. It was an\noldstyle table built for six-faced dice, and operated on\npercentage--most of the time. It was a money-maker, which was the only\nreason Abie kept it. People liked these old-fashioned games. They were\npart of the Martian tradition. A couple of local citizens and a dozen\ntourists were crowded around it, and the diceman's flat emotionless\nvoice carried across the intermittent click and rattle of the dice\nacross the green cloth surface.\n\nI dropped out of the blackjack game after dropping another five\nmunits, and headed slowly towards the dice table. One of the floormen\nlooked at me curiously since I didn't normally touch dice, but\nwhatever he thought he kept to himself. I joined the crowd, and\nwatched for awhile.\n\nRedman was sitting in the game, betting at random. He played the\nfield, come and don't come, and occasionally number combinations. When\nit came his turn at the dice he made two passes, a seven and a four\nthe hard way, let the pile build and crapped out on the next roll.\nThen he lost the dice with a seven after an eight. There was nothing\nunusual about it, except that after one run of the table I noticed\nthat he won more than he lost. He was pocketing most of his\nwinnings--but I was watching him close and keeping count. That was\nenough for me. I got into the game, followed his lead, duplicating his\nbets. And I won too.\n\nPeople are sensitive. Pretty quick they began to see that Redman and I\nwere winning and started to follow our leads. I gave them a dirty look\nand dropped out, and after four straight losses, Redman did likewise.\n\nHe went over to the roulette wheel and played straight red and black.\nHe won there too. And after awhile he went back to the dice table. I\ncashed in. Two thousand was fair enough and there was no reason to\nmake myself unpopular. But I couldn't help staying to watch the fun. I\ncould feel it coming--a sense of something impending.\n\nRedman's face was flushed a dull vermilion, his eyes glittered with\nruby glints, and his breath came faster. The dice had a grip on him\njust like cards do on me. He was a gambler all right--one of the fool\nkind that play it cozy until they're a little ahead and then plunge\noverboard and drown.\n\n\"Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen,\" the diceman droned. \"Eight is\nthe point.\" His rake swept over the board collecting a few munit\nplaques on the wrong spots. Redman had the dice. He rolled. Eight--a\nfive and a three. \"Let it ride,\" he said,--and I jumped nervously. He\nshould have said, \"Leave it.\" But the diceman was no purist. Another\nroll--seven. The diceman looked inquiringly at Redman. The big man\nshook his head, and rolled again--four. Three rolls later he made his\npoint. Then he rolled another seven, another seven, and an eleven. And\nthe pile of munits in front of him had become a respectable heap.\n\n\"One moment, sir,\" the diceman said as he raked in the dice. He rolled\nthem in his hands, tossed them in the air, and handed them back.\n\n\"That's enough,\" Redman said. \"Cash me in.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I said I had enough.\"\n\n\"Your privilege, sir.\"\n\n\"One more then,\" Redman said, taking the dice and stuffing munits into\nhis jacket. He left a hundred on the board, rolled, and came up with a\nthree. He grinned. \"Thought I'd pushed my luck as far as it would go,\"\nhe said, as he stuffed large denomination bills into his pockets.\n\n\n\nI sidled up to him. \"Get out of here, buster,\" I said. \"That diceman\nswitched dice on you. You're marked now.\"\n\n\"I saw him,\" Redman replied in a low voice, not looking at me. \"He's\nnot too clever, but I'll stick around, maybe try some more roulette.\"\n\n\"It's your funeral,\" I whispered through motionless lips.\n\nHe turned away and I left. There was no reason to stay, and our little\ntalk just might have drawn attention. They could have a probe tuned on\nus now. I went down the strip to Otto's and waited. It couldn't have\nbeen more than a half hour later that Redman came by. He was looking\nover his shoulder and walking fast. His pockets, I noted, were\nbulging. So I went out the back door, cut down the serviceway to the\nnext radius street, and flagged a cab.\n\n\"Where to, mister?\" the jockey said.\n\n\"The strip--and hurry.\"\n\nThe jockey fed propane to the turbine and we took off like a scorched\nzarth. \"Left or right?\" he asked as the strip leaped at us. I crossed\nmy fingers, estimated the speed of Redman's walk, and said, \"Right.\"\n\nWe took the corner on two of our three wheels and there was Redman,\nwalking fast toward the south airlock, and behind him, half-running,\ncame two of Abie's goons.\n\n\"Slow down--_fast_!\" I yapped, and was crushed against the back of the\nfront seat as the jock slammed his foot on the brakes. \"In here!\" I\nyelled at Redman as I swung the rear door open.\n\nHis reflexes were good. He hit the floor in a flat dive as the purple\nstreak of a stat blast flashed through the space where he had been.\nThe jockey needed no further stimulation. He slammed his foot down and\nwe took off with a screech of polyprene, whipped around the next\ncorner and headed for the hub, the cops, and safety.\n\n\"Figured you was jerking some guy, Cyril,\" the jockey said over his\nshoulder. \"But who is he?\"\n\n\n\nRedman picked himself off the floor as I swore under my breath. The\njockey _would_ have to know me. Abie'd hear of my part in this by\nmorning and my hide wouldn't be worth the price of a mangy rat skin. I\nhad to get out of town--fast! And put plenty of distance between me\nand Marsport. This dome--this planet--wasn't going to be healthy for\nquite a while. Abie was the most unforgiving man I knew where money\nwas concerned, and if the large, coarse notes dripping from Redman's\npockets were any indication, there was lots of money concerned.\n\n\"Where to now, Cyril?\" the jockey asked.\n\nThere was only one place to go. I damned the greed that made me pick\nRedman up. I figured that he'd be grateful to the tune of a couple of\nkilomunits but what was a couple of thousand if Abie thought I was\nmixed up in this? Lucky I had a spaceship even if she was an\nunconverted Centaurian. I could stand the cramped quarters a lot\nbetter than I could take a session in Abie's back room. I'd seen what\nhappened to guys who went in there, and it wasn't pretty. \"To the\nspaceport,\" I said, \"and don't spare the hydrocarbons.\"\n\n\"Gotcha!\" the jock said and the whine of the turbine increased another\nten decibels.\n\n\"Thanks, Wallingford,\" Redman said. \"If you hadn't pulled me out I'd\nhave had to shoot somebody. And I don't like killing. It brings too\nmany lawmen into the picture.\" He was as cool as ice. I had to admire\nhis nerve.\n\n\"Thanks for nothing,\" I said. \"I figured you'd be grateful in a more\nsolid manner.\"\n\n\"Like this?\" he thrust a handful of bills at me. There must have been\nfour thousand in that wad. It cheered me up a little.\n\n\"Tell me where you want to get off,\" I said.\n\n\"You said you have a spaceship,\" he countered.\n\n\"I do, but it's a Centaurian job. I might be able to squeeze into it\nbut I doubt if you could. About the only spot big enough for you\nwould be the cargo hold, and the radiation'd fry you before we even\nmade Venus.\"\n\nHe grinned at me. \"I'll take the chance,\" he said.\n\n\"Okay, sucker,\" I thought. \"You've been warned.\" If he came along he'd\ndamn well go in the hold. I could cut the drives after we got clear of\nMars and dump him out--after removing his money, of course. \"Well,\" I\nsaid aloud, \"it's your funeral.\"\n\n\"You're always saying that,\" he said with chuckle in his voice.\n\n\n\nWe checked out at the airlock and drove out to the spaceport over the\nsand-filled roadbed that no amount of work ever kept clean. We cleared\nthe port office, drew spacesuits from Post Supply, and went out to my\nyacht. Redman looked at her, his heart in his eyes. He seemed\noverwhelmed by it.\n\n\"Lord! she's beautiful!\" he breathed, as he looked at the slim\npolished length standing on her broad fins, nose pointed skyward.\n\n\"Just a Starflite-class yacht,\" I said.\n\n\"Look, Cyril,\" he said. \"Will you sell her?\"\n\n\"If we get to Venus alive and you still want to buy her, she'll cost\nyou--\" I hesitated, \"twenty-five thousand.\"\n\n\"Done!\" he said. It came so fast that I figured I should have asked\nfor fifty.\n\n\"The fuel will be extra,\" I said. \"Fifty munits an ounce. There's\nmaybe ten pounds of it.\"\n\n\"How far will that take me?\"\n\n\"About ten light-years at cruising speed. Gold is economical.\"\n\n\"That should be far enough,\" he said with a faint smile.\n\nWe drew the boarding ladder down and prepared to squeeze aboard. As I\nfigured it, we had plenty of time, but I hadn't counted on that nosy\nguard at the check station, or maybe that character at the south\nairlock of the dome, because I was barely halfway up the ladder to the\nhatch when I heard the howl of a racing turbine and two headlights\ncame cutting through the night over the nearest dune. The speed with\nwhich that car was coming argued no good.\n\n\"Let's go,\" I said, making with the feet.\n\n\"I'm right behind you,\" Redman said into my left heel. \"Hurry! Those\nguys are out for blood!\"\n\nI tumbled through the lock and wiggled up the narrow passageway. By\nsome contortionist's trick Redman came through the hatch feet first,\nan odd looking gun in his hand. Below us the turbo screeched to a stop\nand men boiled out, blasters in hand. They didn't wait--just started\nfiring. Electrostatic discharges leaped from the metal of the ship,\nbut they were in too much of a hurry. The gun in Redman's fist\nsteadied as he took careful aim. A tiny red streak hissed out of the\nmuzzle--and the roof fell in! A thunderous explosion and an\neye-wrenching burst of light filled the passageway through the slit in\nthe rapidly closing hatch. The yacht rocked on her base like a tree in\na gale, as the hatch slammed shut.\n\n\"What in hell was _that_?\" I yelped.\n\n\"Just a low yield nuclear blast,\" Redman said. \"About two tons. Those\nlads won't bother us any more.\"\n\n\"You fool!--you stupid moronic abysmal fool!\" I said dully. \"You're\nnot content to get Abie on our heels. Now you've triggered off the\nwhole Galactic Patrol. Don't you know that nuclear weapons are\nbanned--that they've been banned ever since our ancestors destroyed\nEarth--that their use calls for the execution of the user? Just where\ndo you come from that you don't know the facts of life?\"\n\n\"Earth,\" Redman said.\n\n\n\nIt left me numb. Any fool knew that there was no life on that\nradioactive hell. Even now, spacers could see her Van Allen bands\nburning with blue-green fire. Earth was a sterile world--a horrible\nexample, the only forbidden planet in the entire galaxy, a galactic\nchamber of horrors ringed with automatic beacons and patrol ships to\nwarn strangers off. We Martians, Earth's nearest neighbor, had the\nwhole history of that last suicidal war drummed into us as children.\nAfter all, we _were_ the cradle of Galactic civilization even though\nwe got that way by being driven off Earth--and feeling that almost any\nplace would be better than Mars. Mars iron built the ships and powered\nthe atomics that had conquered the galaxy. But we knew Earth better\nthan most, and to hear those words from Redman's lips was a shock.\n\n\"You're a damn liar!\" I exploded.\n\n\"You're entitled to your opinion,\" Redman said, \"but you should know\nthe truth when it is told to you. I _am_ from Earth!\"\n\n\"But--\" I said.\n\n\"You'd better get out of here,\" Redman said, \"your Patrol will be here\nshortly.\"\n\nI was thinking that, too. So I wiggled my way up to the control room,\nbraced myself against the walls and fired the jets. Acceleration\ncrushed me flat as the ship lifted and bored out into space.\n\nAs quickly as I could, I cut the jets so the Patrol couldn't trace us\nby our ion trail, flipped the negative inertia generator on and gave\nthe ship one minimal blast that hurled her out of sight. We coasted at\na few thousand miles per second along the plane of the ecliptic while\nwe took stock.\n\nRedman had wedged himself halfway into the control room and eyed my\ncramped body curiously. \"It's a good thing you're a runt,\" he said.\n\"Otherwise we'd be stuck down there.\" He laughed. \"You look like a\njack in the box--all coiled up ready to spring out.\"\n\nBut I was in no mood for humor. Somehow I felt that I'd been conned.\n\"What do I get out of this?\" I demanded.\n\n\"A whole skin--at least for awhile.\"\n\n\"That won't do me any good unless I can take it somewhere.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Redman said. \"They don't give a damn about you. It's me\nthey want, turn on your radio and see.\"\n\nI flipped the switch and a voice came into the control room--\"remind\nyou that this is a Galactic emergency! The Patrol has announced that\nan inhabitant of Earth has been on Mars! This individual is\ndangerously radioactive. A reward of one hundred thousand Galactic\nmunits will be paid to the person who gives information leading to his\ndeath or capture. I repeat,--_one hundred thousand munits_! The man's\ndescription is as follows: Height 180 centimeters, weight 92\nkilograms, eyes reddish brown, hair red. A peculiarity which makes him\neasily recognized is the red color of his skin. He is armed with a\nnuclear weapon and is dangerous. When last seen he was leaving\nMarsport spacefield. Starflite class yacht, registration number CY\n127439. He has a citizen with him, probably a hostage. If seen, notify\nthe nearest Patrol ship.\"\n\n\n\nI looked at Redman. The greed must have shone from me like a beacon.\n\"A hundred grand!\" I said softly.\n\n\"Try and collect,\" Redman said.\n\n\"I'm not going to,\" I said and turned three separate plans to capture\nhim over in my head.\n\n\"They won't work,\" Redman said. He grinned nastily. \"And don't worry\nabout radioactivity. I'm no more contaminated than you are.\"\n\n\"Yeah?--and just how do you live on that hotbox without being\ncontaminated?\" I asked.\n\n\"Simple. The surface isn't too hot in the first place. Most of the\nstuff is in the Van Allen belts. Second, we live underground. And\nthird we're protected.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Where do you think this red skin comes from? It isn't natural. Even\nyou should know that. Actually we had the answer to protection during\nthe Crazy Years before the blowup when everybody talked peace and\nbuilt missiles. A bacteriologist named Anderson discovered it while\nworking with radiation sterilized food. He isolated a whole family of\nbacteria from the food that not only survived, but lived normally in\nthe presence of heavy doses of radiation. The microbes all had one\nthing in common--a peculiar reddish pigment that protected them.\n\n\"Luckily, the military of his nation--the United States, I think they\ncalled it, thought that this pigment might be a useful protective\nshield for supplies. Extracts were made and tested before the Blowup\ncame, and there was quite a bit of it on hand.\n\n\"But the real hero of protection was a general named Ardleigh. He\nordered every man and woman in his command inoculated with the extract\nright after the Blowup--when communications were disorganized and\ncommanders of isolated units had unchallengeable power. He was later\nfound to be insane, but his crazy idea was right. The inoculations\nkilled ten per cent of his command and turned those who lived a bright\nred, but none of the living showed a sign of radiation sickness after\nthey received the extract.\n\n\"By this time your ancestors--the Runners--had gone, and those who\nstayed were too busy trying to remain alive to worry much about them.\nThe \"Double A\" vaccine--named for Anderson and Ardleigh--was given to\nevery person and animal that could be reached, but it was only a small\nfraction of the population that survived. The others died. But enough\nmen and animals remained to get a toe-hold on their ruined world, and\nthey slowly rebuilt.\n\n\"We had forgotten about you Runners--but it seems you didn't forget\nus. You sealed us off--forced us to remain on Earth. And by the time\nwe were again ready for space, you were able to prevent us. But we\nwill not be denied forever. It took an entire planet working together\nto get me on Mars to learn your secrets. And when I got here, I found\nthat I wouldn't have time to learn. We had forgotten one simple\nthing--my skin color. It isn't normal here and there is no way of\nchanging it since the extract combines permanently with body cells. So\nI had to do the next best thing--obtain a sample of your technology\nand bring it to Earth. I planned at first to get enough money to buy a\nship. But those creeps in Marsport don't lose like gentlemen. I damn\nnear had to beat my way out of that joint. And when a couple of them\ncame after me, I figured it was all up. I could kill them of course,\nbut that wouldn't solve anything. Since I can't fly one of your ships\nyet, I couldn't steal one--and I wouldn't have time to buy one because\nI was pretty sure the Patrol would be after me as soon as the rumors\nof a red man got around. You see--_they_ know what we look like and\nits their job to keep us cooped up--\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" I said.\n\n\"Why do they do it?\" Redman asked. \"We're just as human as you are.\"\nHe shrugged. \"At any rate,\" he finished, \"I was at the end of my rope\nwhen you came along. But you have a ship--you can fly--and you'll take\nme back to Earth.\"\n\n\"I will?\" I asked.\n\n\n\nHe nodded. \"I can make it worth your while,\" he said.\n\n\"How?\" I asked.\n\n\"Money. You'll do anything for money.\" Redman looked at me soberly.\n\"You're a repulsive little weasel, Cyril, and I would distrust you\nthoroughly except that I know you as well as you know me. That's the\nvirtue of being human. We understand each other without words. You are\na cheap, chiseling, doublecrossing, money-grabbing heel. You'd kick\nyour mother's teeth out for a price. And for what I'm going to offer\nyou, you'll jump at the chance to help us--but I don't have to tell\nyou that. You know already.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--know already?\" I said. \"Can I read your mind?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me--\" Redman began. And then a peculiar smile\ncrossed his face, a light of dawning comprehension. \"Why no,\" he said,\n\"why should you be telepathic--why should you? And to think I kept\nhiding--\" he broke off and looked at me with a superior look a man\ngives his dog. Affectionate but pitying. \"No wonder there were no\npsych fields protecting that dice game--and I thought--\" he started to\nlaugh.\n\n\n\nAnd I knew then why the Patrol had sealed Earth off. Mutated by\nradiation, speeded up in their evolution by the effects of the Blowup,\nEarthmen were as far ahead of us mentally as we were ahead of them\ntechnologically. To let these telepaths, these telekinetics--and God\nknows what else--loose on the Galaxy would be like turning a bunch of\nhungry kelats loose in a herd of fat sloats. My head buzzed like it\nwas filled with a hive of bees. For the first time in years I stopped\nthinking of the main chance. So help me, I was feeling _noble_!\n\n\"Just take it easy, Cyril,\" Redman said. \"Don't get any bright ideas.\"\n\nBright ideas! Ha! I should be getting bright ideas with a character\nwho could read me like a book. What I needed was something else.\n\n\"If you cooperate,\" Redman said, \"you'll be fixed for life.\"\n\n\"You're not kidding,\" I said. \"I'd be fixed all right. The Patrol'd\nhound me all the way to Andromeda if I helped you. And don't think\nthey wouldn't find out. While we can't read minds, we can tell when a\nman's lying.\"\n\n\"Have you ever heard of Fort Knox?\" Redman asked.\n\nFort Knox--Fort Knox--_fourknocks_! the thought staggered me.\n\n\"The gold I had came from there,\" Redman said.\n\nFourknocks! Sure, I'd heard of it. What citizen hadn't? They still\ntell stories of that fabulous hoard of gold. Tons of it buried on\nEarth waiting for someone with guts enough to go in and find it.\n\n\"All your ship will hold,\" Redman said. \"After we analyze its\nprinciples.\"\n\nFive tons of gold! Six million munits! So much money! It staggered me.\nI'd never dreamed of that much money. Redman was right. I _would_ kick\nmy mother's teeth out if the price was right. And the price--I jumped\nconvulsively. My arm brushed the control board, kicking off the\nnegative inertia and slapping the axial correction jets.\n\nThe ship spun like a top! Centrifugal force crushed me against the\ncontrol room floor. Redman, an expression of pained surprise on his\nface before it slammed against the floor, was jammed helplessly in the\ncorridor. I had time for one brief grin. The Patrol would zero in on\nus, and I'd have a hundred thousand I could spend. What could I do\nwith six million I couldn't use?\n\nThen hell broke out. A fire extinguisher came loose from its\nfastenings and started flying around the room in complete defiance of\nartificial gravity. Switches on the control board clicked on and off.\nThe ship bucked, shuddered and jumped. But the spin held. Redman,\ncrushed face down to the floor, couldn't see what he was doing.\nBesides--he didn't know what he was doing--but he was trying. The fire\nextinguisher came whizzing across the floor and cracked me on the\nshin. A scream of pure agony left my lips as I felt the bone snap.\n\n\"Got you!\" Redman grunted, as he lifted his head against the crushing\nforce and sighted at me like a gunner. The extinguisher reversed its\nflight across the room and came hurtling at my head.\n\n\"Too late!\" I gloated mentally. Then the world was filled with novae\nand comets as the extinguisher struck. The cheerful thought that\nRedman was trapped because he didn't--couldn't--know how to drive a\nhypership was drowned in a rush of darkness.\n\n\n\nWhen I came to, my leg was aching like a thousand devils and I was\nlying on a rocky surface. Near--terribly near--was a jagged rock\nhorizon cutting the black of space dotted with the blazing lights of\nstars. I groaned and rolled over, wincing at the double pain in leg\nand head. Redman was standing over me, carrying a couple of oxygen\nbottles and a black case. He looked odd, standing there with a load in\nhis arms that would have crushed him flat on Mars. And then I knew. I\nwas on an asteroid.\n\n\"But how did I get here?\"\n\n\"Easy,\" Redman's voice came over my headphone. \"Didn't anyone ever\ntell you an unconscious mind is easier to read than a conscious one?\"\nHe chuckled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I don't suppose they did--but it is.\nIndeed it is.\" He laid the bottles down, and put the box beside them.\n\"I learned how to operate the ship, stopped the spin, and got her back\ninto negative inertia before the Patrol found me. Found this place\nabout an hour ago--and since you began to look like you'd live, I\nfigured you should have a chance. So I'm leaving you a communicator\nand enough air to keep you alive until you can get help. But so help\nme--you don't deserve it. After I played square with you, you try to\ndo this to me.\"\n\n\"Square!\" I yelped. \"Why you--\" The rest of what I said was\nunprintable.\n\nRedman grinned at me, his face rosy behind the glassite of his\nhelmet--and turned away. I turned to watch him picking his way\ncarefully back to where the yacht rested lightly on the naked rock. At\nthe airlock he turned and waved at me. Then he squeezed inside. The\nlock closed. There was a brief shimmer around the ship--a briefer\nblast of heat, and the yacht vanished.\n\nI turned on the communicator and called for help. I used the Patrol\nband. \"I'll keep the transmitter turned on so you can home in on me,\"\nI broad-casted, \"but get that Earthman first! He's got my money and my\nship. Pick me up later, but get him now!\"\n\nI didn't know whether my message was received or not, because Redman\ndidn't leave me any receiver other than the spacesuit intercom in my\nhelmet. It was, I suspected, a deliberate piece of meanness on his\npart. So I kept talking until my voice was a hoarse croak, calling the\nPatrol, calling--calling--calling, until a black shark shape blotted\nout the stars overhead and a couple of Patrolmen in jetsuits homed in\non me.\n\n\"Did you get him?\" I asked.\n\nThe Patrolman bending over me shrugged his shoulders. \"They haven't\ntold me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThey hauled me back to Marsport, put my leg in a cast, ran me through\nthe lie detector, and then tossed me in jail for safekeeping. I beefed\nabout the jail, but not too loud. As I figured it I was lucky to be\nout of Abie's hands.\n\nTwo days later, a Patrolman with the insignia of a Commander on his\ncollar tabs showed up at my cell. He was apologetic. I was a hero, he\nsaid. Seems like the Patrol caught Redman trying to sneak through the\nasteroid belt on standard drive and blasted him out of space.\n\nSo they gave me the reward and turned me loose.\n\nBut it didn't do me any good. After taxes, it only came to twenty\nthousand, and Abie grabbed that before I could get out of town. Like\nI said, Abie's unforgiving where money's concerned, and Redman had\ntaken him for over thirty kilos, which, according to Abie was my fault\nfor lifting him and getting him out of town. After he got my twenty\nkilos he still figured I owed him twelve--and so I've never made it\nback. Every time I get a stake he grabs it, and what with the\ninterest, I still owe him twelve.\n\nBut I still keep trying, because there's still a chance. You see, when\nRedman probed around in my mind to learn how to run the spaceship, he\nwas in a hurry. He must have done something to my brain, because when\nhe left me on that asteroid, as he turned and waved at me, I could\nhear him thinking that the Patrol would not be able to stop\nhyperships, and if he made it to Earth his people could emigrate to\nsome clean world and stop having to inject their kids, and while they\ncouldn't make the grade themselves, their kids could crash the Galaxy\nwithout any trouble. I got the impression that it wouldn't be too much\ntrouble to empty Earth. Seems as though there wasn't many more than a\nmillion people left. The red color wasn't complete protection\napparently.\n\nAnd there's another thing. About a month after I got the reward, there\nwas a minor complaint from Centaurus V about one of their officials\nwho disappeared on a vacation trip to Mars. His ship was a Starflite\nclass, Serial CY 122439. Get the idea?\n\nSo I keep watching all the incoming tourists like you. Someday I\nfigure I'm going to run into a decolorized Earthman. They won't be\nable to stay away any more than the other peoples of the Galaxy. Old\nMother Earth keeps dragging them back even though they've been gone\nfor over a thousand years. Don't get the idea they want to see Mars.\nIt's Earth that draws them. And it'll draw an Earthman's kids. And I\nfigure that if I could read Redman's mind, I can read theirs, too even\nthough I haven't read a thought since. It figures, does it not?\n\nHey! Hold on! There's no need to run. All I want to do is collect a\nfifty year old bill--plus interest. Your folks owe me that much.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
