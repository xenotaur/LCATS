    "body": "Toryl pointed the small crypterpreter toward the wooden,\nhorseshoe-shaped sign. The sign's legend was carved in bright yellow\nletters. Sartan, Toryl's companion, watched up and down the open highway\nfor signs of life. In seconds the small cylindrical mechanism completed\nthe translation.\n\nThe sign said:\n\n      JUBILATION, U.S.A.!!\n\n    The doggondest, cheeriest\n     little town in America!\n\nThe two aliens smiled at each other. Unaccustomed to oral conversation,\nthey exchanged thoughts.\n\n\"_The crypterpreter worked incredibly fast. The language is quite\nsimple. It would seem safe to proceed. The sign indicates\nfriendliness_,\" thought Toryl, the older of the two Capellans.\n\n\"_Very well, Brother_,\" replied Sartan, \"_though I still worry for the\nsafety of the ship_.\"\n\n\"_Sartan, our instruments tell us that anyone who discovers the ship_,\"\nToryl explained, a trifle impatient, \"_will show a remarkable degree of\ncuriosity before they display any hostility_.\"\n\nSartan agreed to dismiss his worries and the two aliens began to walk\nalong the barren highway. Before them, at a great distance, they could\nsee a cluster of small frame buildings. When they had walked a hundred\nfeet or more they encountered another sign.\n\n         JUBILATION, U.S.A.!!\n\n    WELCOME, STRANGER! See America\n         first and begin with\n              JUBILATION!\n\nAnd several hundred feet further two more signs.\n\n    THE ROTARY CLUB of Jubilation\n    welcomes and extends the warm\n    hand of friendship to you!!!!\n    You are now entering Paradise,\n              brother!\n\n    HOWDY, STRANGER! COME RIGHT\n    ON IN, STAY AWHILE AND MAKE\n         YOURSELF TO HOME!\n\n      --Jubilation Chamber of\n        Commerce--\n\nAs members of a peaceful race, Toryl and Sartan naturally found the\nsigns encouraging. They walked at a sprightly pace.\n\nA whirring noise behind them brought the two to a halt. They turned to\ndiscover a pre-war Chevy choking its way along the road. The aliens\nedged their way to a gulley along the side of the road. They were\nconfident of a friendly reception but, in the event their calculations\nhad been wrong, they poised themselves to make a break in the direction\nof their ship.\n\nThe ancient Chevy sputtered by. The driver was almost as ancient as the\ncar, a bearded fellow with a stogy stuck between his teeth and a crushed\nhat on his head.\n\nThe driver slowed down when he saw the aliens. \"Howdy, strangers!\" he\nyelled cheerily. \"Say, ain't you fellers a mite warm in them coveralls?\"\nHe cackled merrily, put his foot to the floor and sped on by.\n\nSartan looked at his companion. \"_I am sorry, I should not have doubted\nyou, Brother. You were right. These people will welcome our visit. They\nseem very cordial._\"\n\n\"_Good, Sartan. Let us continue._\"\n\nOne hundred yards further they were confronted by still another brace of\nsigns. They stopped once more.\n\n                CITY LIMITS\n             (Gambling allowed)\n\n        JUBILATION! WHERE TROUBLES\n        never come due, 'cause the\n      Good Lord takes a likin' to YOU!\n\n     Where gloom and doom are outlawed\n       and there's never any sadness.\n\n    Where a smile lights up the midnight\n      sky and gives off only gladness!\n\n             (Gambling allowed)\n\nThe second sign was another in the shape of a horseshoe.\n\n    BEYOND THIS POINT YOU HAVE 4372\n    FRIENDS YOU NEVER HAD BEFORE!!!\n\n          (Gambling allowed)\n\nSuddenly Toryl stopped and played with several switches and dials on the\ncrypterpreter.\n\n\"_What is wrong, Brother?_\" asked the puzzled Sartan.\n\n\"_I receive no direct translation for the term 'gambling'._\"\n\n\"_What is the closest term the machine gives?_\"\n\n\"_Fraternizing._\"\n\nSartan laughed. \"_Now it is you who fret, Toryl. According to the\nsignpost legends 'fraternizing' would seem to be accurate._\"\n\n\n\nA steady rolling sound of passionless one-armed bandits drowned out all\nother noise in Okie's Oasis Bar. As a result, Toryl and Sartan drew\nlittle attention when they entered. Except for their blue-metallic space\nsuits they looked like and _were_ ordinary humans.\n\nThey proceeded rather timidly toward the bar. Okie, the proprietor, was\non duty readying the place for the night shift. Toryl held up his hand.\nThe crypterpreter had already informed him that oral conversation was\nthe manner of communication on the strange planet. Such conversation had\nlong ago been abandoned on the planet Capella, but learned men such as\nToryl and Sartan were familiar with how it was done, though when they\nspoke they sometimes had to halt between syllables.\n\n\"How-dy!\" Toryl flashed a wide grin at the barkeep.\n\n\"Just hold your horses there, mister!\" was Okie's sharp reply. \"You\nain't the only snake in this desert. There's four customers ahead of\nyou!\"\n\nSartan transmitted an admonishing thought to his companion. \"_Toryl, you\nshould have noticed that the man was busy. He has only two hands._\"\n\n\"_Forgive me, Brother, I was blinded by my own excitement._\"\n\nThe two Capellans waited and were soon attracted by the silver-handled\nmachines that seemed to have most of the customers fascinated.\n\nSartan wandered over to where a small crowd of men was gathered around a\nsingle machine. A huge man, raw-boned and crimson-faced, wearing surplus\narmy suntans, was operating the machine.\n\nThe big man dropped a large coin into a slot. He gave the silver handle\na vicious snap. It made a discordant, bone-crushing sound. Three little\nwheels, visible under glass, spun dizzily. Anxious, screwed-up faces\nlooked on as the first little wheel stopped. _Bell Fruit._\n\nA collective gasp came from the small crowd. The second little wheel\nstopped. _Bell Fruit._\n\nAnother gasp.\n\nSartan touched the arm of the man operating the gambling device. \"I beg\nyour pardon, but could you please tell me--\"\n\nThe big man wheeled around like a bear aroused from hibernation. \"Hands\noff, mister! You trying to jinx me?\"\n\nThe third little wheel stopped. _Lemon._\n\nThe crowd groaned. The big man turned on Sartan again, a wild and\nfurious look in his eye. \"You jinxed me! Damn you, I oughta' bust you\none right in the snout!!\"\n\n\"My humble apol-o-gies, sir,\" the bewildered Sartan began.\n\n\"I'll give you your humble apologies right back with my fist,\" roared\nthe gambler.\n\nToryl quickly made his way through the small crowd which by now was\nitching to witness a fight. \"Ex-cuse me, sir, but my friend did not\nreal-ize--\"\n\n\"The hell he didn't!\" The gambler fumed. \"He was trying to jinx me, by\nGod! And I'm gonna teach him to keep his paws--\"\n\n\"Okay, okay, you guys, break it up!!\" It was Okie, massive and mean\nlooking, using his barrel belly to push his way through to the two\naliens and the unlucky gambler. \"What's goin' on here, Smokey?\" he\ninquired of the gambler.\n\n\"Okie, I had a jackpot workin' when this dumb jerk here ups and grabs my\narm--\"\n\nToryl interrupted with, \"My friend is sorry for what he did, sir.\"\n\nOkie stabbed a cigar into his mouth. \"Who _are_ you guys anyhow? Where'd\nyou dig up them crazy coveralls?\"\n\n\"Sure a queer way to dress in this heat,\" spoke a voice from the crowd.\n\nThis was the moment of pride that Toryl and Sartan had looked forward\nto. They both grinned confident grins. \"We have come to you from\nCapella,\" he said with some exultation.\n\nOkie's face went blank. \"Capella! Where the hell is that?\"\n\n\"Sounds like one of them damn hick towns in California,\" said Smokey,\nthe gambler.\n\nToryl, somewhat deflated, but by no means defeated, hastened to\nelucidate. \"Capella is lo-cat-ed in the con-stell-a-tion which you call\nAuriga.\"\n\n\"Anybody know what the hell he's talking about?\" asked the annoyed\nsaloonkeeper.\n\nToryl and Sartan exchanged troubled glances. Sartan took up the cudgel.\n\"Auriga is a constellation, a star cluster, sir. It is forty-two million\nlight years away.\"\n\n\"What in tarnation is a light year?\" asked an old-timer in the group.\n\nAnother replied, \"They must be from Alaska. They got light years up\nthere, sometimes stays light the whole confounded year 'round.\"\n\n\"That must be it,\" agreed Okie, \"and that's why they're wearin' them\ncrazy suits.\" The saloonkeeper unloosed a grim laugh. \"You can take them\narctic pajamas off now, boys. Weather's kinda warm in these parts!\"\n\n\"Hey, fellas!\" a voice shot out, \"didya bring any Eskimo babes down with\nyou?\"\n\n\n\nThe crowd roared approval at the witticism.\n\nToryl transmitted a depressing thought to his companion. \"_I fear they\ndo not believe us, Sartan._\"\n\nSartan did not get the opportunity to answer immediately.\n\n\"Listen, you guys,\" Okie pounded his fat finger into Sartan's chest. \"I\nwant you to behave yourselves, understand? Now that means lay off the\ncustomers while they're at the games. You wanna gamble there is plenty\nof machines available. I got a respectable place, I wanna keep it that\nway!\" He turned and addressed the other men. \"All right, boys, fun's\nover! No fight today! Drink up and gamble your money away. Let's get\nback to the games.\"\n\n\n\nIt was necessary for Toryl to use the crypterpreter to translate the\nvarious signs along the bar. Okie saw the small cylindrical machine\nsitting on the bar. His curiosity bested him. He gave it a more thorough\nexamination than a dog gives a fireplug.\n\nSome of the signs read: \"DOUBLE BOURBON--$2.10\" \"COOL GIN RICKEY--$1.25\"\n\"IN GOD WE TRUST, BUT NOBODY ELSE!\" \"RUM COLLINS--$1\" \"A FRIEND IN NEED\nIS A FRIEND INDEED\" \"NO INDIANS SERVED HERE\" and \"SCOTCH--IMPORTED,\n$1.50--DOMESTIC, $1.30.\"\n\n\"Cool gin rick-ey,\" said Toryl.\n\n\"Comin' right up,\" Okie mumbled, his attention still wrapped around the\ncrypterpreter. \"Say, what is this gadget anyway?\"\n\n\"It is a cryp-terp-reter,\" Toryl beamed with pride. \"It en-ables us to\nun-der-stand and speak your lan-guage.\"\n\n\"Aw, go on!\" Okie managed a fainthearted grin, uncertain of whether his\nleg was being pulled. \"Come on now, tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"But I have just told you, sir.\"\n\nThe barkeep cursed under his breath. \"Two gin rickeys, did you say?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nOkie brought the drinks.\n\nSartan smiled broadly. \"Thank you ex-ceed-ing-ly.\"\n\n\"That'll be two-fifty.\"\n\nToryl raised his glass as though making a toast. \"Two-fif-ty!\" he\nrepeated.\n\nOkie caught his arm and brought the glass down.\n\n\"Two-fifty!\" the barkeep said with grim insistence.\n\nSartan pursed his lips comprehendingly. He removed a large pentagonal\npiece of metal from his pocket and gave it to Okie.\n\nOkie took the piece between his fingers, examined it and frowned. \"I\ngive up. What is it?\"\n\nSartan had to glance at Toryl for an answer. Toryl threw a switch on the\ncrypterpreter.\n\n\"_Money_,\" Toryl silently advised him.\n\n\"Money,\" said Sartan to Okie.\n\n\"You guys hold on and don't drink up yet,\" growled the barkeep. He then\nyelled in the direction of the blackjack table. \"Hey, Nugget! Get on\nover here, I need you!!\"\n\nA wiry little man with a full, unkempt beard, hustled over to the bar.\n\"Nugget McDermott at yer service, Okie! What's yer pleasure?\" he asked\nwith a sunny smile.\n\n\"Take a look at this.\" Okie handed him the piece of metal.\n\nThe old prospector turned it over in his hands, bit it and then held it\nin his palm as though to judge its weight. His expert opinion was, \"It's\ngold, Okie,\" and was uttered without a shred of modesty.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\nThe old-timer was highly insulted. \"Am I sure!! Why you lop-eared,\nsun-stroked jackass, of course I'm sure!!! Nugget McDermott is drawed to\ngold like nails to a magnet! Why when this here town was nothin' but a\npatch of cactus--\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" Okie waved him off, \"don't get your gander up!\nGo on back to the blackjack table and tell Sam to give you a drink on\nthe house.\"\n\n\"Much obliged, Okie, much obliged,\" said Nugget, doffing his hat and\ntrotting back to the blackjack table.\n\nThe barkeep's face was pure sunshine when he turned to the aliens again.\n\"Gentlemen, with this kind of a substitute you don't need money in my\nplace. Drink up!\"\n\n\"Thank you ex-ceed-ing-ly,\" said Sartan.\n\nOkie arbitrarily judged the gold piece to be worth ten dollars. \"The\nmanagement invites you to try your luck, gentlemen. Go on give it a\nwhirl.\"\n\nToryl and Sartan wore blank expressions as Okie slapped seven dollars\nand fifty cents change on the bar--four silver dollars, four\nhalf-dollars and six quarters.\n\n\"Don't be bashful, gentlemen. Okie's machines are friendly to one and\nall,\" said the barkeep.\n\n\n\nToryl removed the change and gave his companion two silver dollars, two\nhalf-dollars and three quarters.\n\n\"_What is the purpose of the machines?_\" thought Sartan as they\napproached the one-armed bandits.\n\n\"_I suppose that is what the one called Okie wishes us to learn._\"\n\n\"_Perhaps it is some type of registration machine._\"\n\n\"_It is doubtful. The gentleman you disturbed has been at the same\nmachine since we arrived._\"\n\nSartan gripped the handle of a vacant machine. \"_Do you think it might\nbe a kind of intelligence test?_\"\n\nIn lieu of an answer Toryl focused his attention on a small card, above\nthe machine, which gave the winning combinations.\n\n\"_There is that term again._\"\n\n\"_What term?_\"\n\n\"_Gambling._\" Toryl pointed to a line on the card warning minors not to\ngamble. A look of perplexity fell upon his face. \"_I am no longer sure\nthe term has anything to do with fraternizing_,\" he observed mentally.\n\n\"_Let us find out._\"\n\nSartan placed a quarter in the coin slot. The three little wheels went\nspinning. Cherry. Lemon. Lemon.\n\nNothing.\n\nToryl and Sartan looked at each other, their faces blanker than ever.\n\n\"_Try it again._\"\n\nSartan disposed of another quarter. They waited. Lemon. Plum. Plum.\n\nNothing.\n\nToryl inspected the machine from every angle, like a man on the outside\ntrying to figure a way in. \"_Let me try it._\"\n\nHe put a quarter in the slot.\n\nThree lemons.\n\n\"_It isn't very interesting, is it?_\" thought Sartan.\n\n\"_Why don't we try the larger pieces?_\"\n\n\"_A splendid idea, Brother._\"\n\nThe larger coins did not fit. Toryl proceeded to report this sad state\nof affairs to Okie and was amazed when, for the eight large coins, Okie\nrewarded him with twenty-four smaller ones. He went back to his\ncompanion at the one-armed bandit.\n\nThey then dropped twenty consecutive quarters into the appropriately\nnamed machine without getting so much as a single quarter in return.\n\n\"_It is puzzling, is it not, Brother?_\"\n\n\"_Yes, Sartan. From all indications it would seem to be a machine\ntotally without purpose._\"\n\n\"_It does consume money._\"\n\n\"_But why would one build a machine whose sole purpose is to consume\nmoney?_\"\n\nSartan gave it some hard thought. \"_I don't know!_\"\n\n\"_Remarkable!_\" Toryl concluded. \"_But nothing is done without a\npurpose._\"\n\n\"_Obviously we've found something that is._\"\n\n\"_No, I do not believe that. Let me have the electro-analyzer._\"\n\n\n\nThe aliens were so engrossed in their problem as to be unaware that Okie\nand two men at the bar were casting suspicious eyes on them.\n\nSartan fished around in his pocket and produced a small object in the\nshape of an irregular triangle. Toryl took the electro-analyzer from\nhim, removed the cover and moved his finger around inside. He replaced\nthe cover and slapped the electro-analyzer against the side of the\none-armed bandit. When he took his hand away the small object stuck to\nthe machine like a leech.\n\nOkie scratched his head and addressed one of the two men at the bar.\n\"What the hell you suppose they're doin', Sam? What's that gadget for?\"\n\n\"Search me,\" replied Sam, a well dressed, stoop-shouldered gent, \"but if\nyou want my opinion it doesn't look legal.\"\n\n\"Hey, Nugget!\" yelled the barkeep.\n\nAgain the little old prospector hustled himself over to the bar.\n\n\"Nugget McDermott at your service! What'll it be, Okie?\"\n\n\"Go on over and get the sheriff. Tell him there's two queer characters\nhere trying to jimmy one of my machines in broad daylight.\"\n\nThe old man's feet kicked up sawdust as he scampered out the door. Okie\nkept his attention riveted to the two aliens.\n\nToryl was busy adjusting the electro-analyzer to the best possible\nposition.\n\n\"_What if it does not respond to this machine?_\" Sartan wanted to know.\n\n\"_I do not think the machine contains any type of metal with which we\nare unfamiliar. We will have a reading in one minute._\"\n\nThe aliens took a step backward and waited.\n\nA sudden noise, like that of a television tube exploding, jolted\neveryone in the room, including Toryl and Sartan. The blackjack table\nemptied. Gamblers left their machines. A semi-circle of the curious\nformed around the two aliens. Okie lit out from behind the bar and\nelbowed his way through the crowd.\n\nThe aliens' concentration was unbroken by the attention they had\naroused. With all the single mindedness of religious fanatics they\ncontinued to observe the strange mechanical device.\n\nOkie was dumbfounded to find the machine still in one piece and doubly\ndumbfounded to discover it was behaving in a most unconventional manner.\nIt was emitting a low steady gurgling sound and an occasional sputter or\nburp. The legs of the machine seemed unsteady. Its body shifted back and\nforth in herky-jerky motions like an old-fashioned washing machine. The\nthree little Bell Fruit wheels were spinning at the speed of an airplane\npropellor. Okie thought they might never stop again.\n\n\"What the hell are you crazy galoots doing to my machine!\" he bellowed.\n\nBefore the aliens could answer there was another explosive sound,\ncausing the crowd to jump back several steps. Quarters fell from the\nmouth of the machine, slowly at first, then at an alarming rate. The\ncoins fell, bounced and rolled all over the floor. The crowd gulped with\nfascination.\n\n\"Holy catfish!\" said one of the men, \"how long since that blasted\nthing's paid off?\"\n\n\"Looks like this is the first time,\" said one of the others.\n\n\"You guys keep quiet!\" yelled Okie.\n\nThe coins continued to fall for what seemed like a record time. The\ncrowd was spellbound. Okie watched in silent fury.\n\nAnd the aliens were more confused than they had been when the machine\n_wasn't_ paying off.\n\n\n\nThe one-armed bandit finally coughed out its last quarter. The three\nBell Fruit wheels came to an abrupt halt, as though an inner spring had\nsnapped. The machine broke down. Certain observers later reported that\nthe poor thing actually _looked_ exhausted.\n\nThe sheriff burst in the door with Nugget McDermott close behind.\n\n\"Sheriff, I want you to arrest these two tinhorns!\" cried Okie.\n\n\"Tinhorns??\" Sartan's face was creased with bewilderment.\n\n\"What's wrong, Okie?\" asked the sheriff.\n\n\"Take a look for yourself! These two bugged my machine and then broke it\ndown! Look at that money all over the floor!\"\n\nToryl smiled. \"We meant no harm, sir--\"\n\n\"The hell you didn't mean no harm! You were out to rob me!\"\n\n\"We were only ex-per-i-ment-ing--\"\n\n\"There's their crooked experimenting right there!\" said Okie, pointing a\nfinger at the deactivated one-armed bandit. \"I want them locked up until\nthat machine's paid for!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the sheriff, \"you two better come with me.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" Sartan protested, \"we merely wanted to know how the machine\nfunctioned. You see, we are from Capella and--\"\n\n\"Capella!\" exclaimed the sheriff. \"Where is that? I never heard of the\nplace.\"\n\n\"Well, it is not a part of your Earth.\"\n\n\"Oh, well why didn't you say so before!\" The sheriff winked at the\ncrowd. \"You mean you boys are from out of this world?\"\n\n\"That is correct,\" Sartan grinned proudly.\n\n\"Well, well! That makes a big difference!\" The sheriff turned to the\ncrowd. \"All right, boys, grab them and hustle them over to the jail\nhouse!\"\n\n\n\nA group of men slowly closed in on the two aliens.\n\nToryl and Sartan backed away toward the wall.\n\n\"_I believe they are angry, Brother_,\" thought Sartan.\n\n\"_But why?_\" inquired Toryl.\n\n\"_I do not know. Do you suppose the machine represented some form of\nreligious deity?_\"\n\n\"_Exceed-ing-ly possible_,\" Toryl answered.\n\nAs the men came closer Okie yelled, \"Just get them two crackpots! I'll\nplug the first man that touches that money!\"\n\nThe men were diverted by Okie's warning. They didn't notice, until it\nwas almost too late, that the two strangers were halfway out the door.\n\n\"Get after them!!\" the sheriff bellowed.\n\nThe aliens ran as though their lives were at stake, which was true,\nfollowing the same route they had taken into town.\n\n\n\nThe crowd followed them as far as the edge of town. From there they\nhurled rocks.\n\nToryl and Sartan continued to run at breakneck speed, praying they would\nreach the safety of the ship. Once they looked behind them and saw that\nthe crowd of angry men had given up the chase.\n\nHalfway back to their ship they passed a sign, though they didn't bother\nto stop and read it.\n\n          YOU ARE NOW LEAVING\n          JUBILATION, U.S.A.!!\n\n    The doggondest, cheeriest little\n    town in America! Come back soon!!\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
