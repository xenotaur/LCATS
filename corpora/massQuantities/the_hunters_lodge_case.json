I myself had been the first sufferer\nfrom the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He was now sitting\nup in bed, propped up with pillows.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d my little friend continued. \u201cOnce more shall I be myself\nagain, the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of evildoers! Figure to\nyourself, _mon ami_, that I have a little paragraph to myself in\n_Society Gossip_. But yes! Here it is!\n\n\u201c\u2018Go it, criminals\u2014all out! Hercule Poirot,\u2014and believe me, girls,\nhe\u2019s some Hercules!\u2014our own pet society detective can\u2019t get a grip on\nyou. \u2019Cause why? \u2019Cause he\u2019s got _la grippe_ himself!\u2019\u201d\n\nI laughed.\n\n\u201cGood for you, Poirot. You are becoming quite a public character. And\nfortunately you haven\u2019t missed anything of particular interest during\nthis time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is true. The few cases I have had to decline did not fill me\nwith any regret.\u201d\n\nOur landlady stuck her head in at the door.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a gentleman downstairs. Says he must see M. Poirot or you,\nCaptain. Seeing as he was in a great to-do,\u2014and with all that quite\nthe gentleman,\u2014I brought up \u2019is card.\u201d\n\nShe handed me the bit of pasteboard. \u201c\u2018Hon. Roger Havering,\u2019\u201d I read.\n\nPoirot motioned with his head toward the bookcase, and I obediently\npulled forth the \u201cWho\u2019s Who.\u201d Poirot took it from me and scanned the\npages rapidly.\n\n\u201cSecond son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth daughter\nof William Crabb.\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m,\u201d I said. \u201cI rather fancy that\u2019s the girl who used to act at the\nFrivolity\u2014only she called herself Zoe Carrisbrook. I remember she\nmarried some young man about town just before the war.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould it interest you, Hastings, to go down and hear what our\nvisitor\u2019s particular trouble is? Make him all my excuses.\u201d\n\nRoger Havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart\nappearance.\n\nHis face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently laboring under\ngreat agitation.\n\n\u201cCaptain Hastings? You are M. Poirot\u2019s partner, I understand. It is\nimperative that he should come with me to Derbyshire today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible,\u201d I replied. \u201cPoirot is ill in\nbed\u2014influenza.\u201d\n\nHis face fell.\n\n\u201cDear me, that is a great blow to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe matter on which you want to consult him is serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy God, yes! My uncle, the best friend I have in the world, was\nfoully murdered last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in London?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, in Derbyshire. I was in town and received a telegram from my wife\nthis morning. Immediately upon its receipt I determined to come round\nand beg M. Poirot to undertake the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you will excuse me a minute,\u201d I said, struck by a sudden idea.\n\nI rushed upstairs, and in few brief words acquainted Poirot with the\nsituation. He took any further words out of my mouth.\n\n\u201cI see\u2014I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why not?\nYou should know my methods by now. All I ask is that you should report\nto me fully every day, and follow implicitly any instructions I may\nwire you.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo this I willingly agreed, and an hour later I was sitting opposite\nMr. Havering in a first-class carriage on the Midland Railway,\nspeeding rapidly away from London.\n\n\u201cTo begin with, Captain Hastings, you must understand that Hunter\u2019s\nLodge, where we are going, and where the tragedy took place, is only a\nsmall shooting-box in the heart of the Derbyshire moors. Our real home\nis near Newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town for the season.\nHunter\u2019s Lodge is looked after by a housekeeper who is quite capable\nof doing all we need when we run down for an occasional week-end. Of\ncourse, during the shooting season, we take down some of our own\nservants from Newmarket.\n\n\u201cMy uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace (as you may know, my mother was a Miss\nPace of New York), has for the last three years made his home with us.\nHe never got on well with my father, or my elder brother, and I\nsuspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather\nincreased than diminished his affection toward me. Of course, I am a\npoor man, and my uncle was a rich one\u2014in other words, he paid the\npiper! But though exacting in many ways, he was not really hard to get\non with, and we all three lived very harmoniously together.\n\n\u201cTwo days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent gayeties of\nours in town, suggested that we should run down to Derbyshire for a\nday or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton, the housekeeper,\nand we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday evening I was forced\nto return to town, but my wife and my uncle remained on. This morning\nI received this telegram.\u201d\n\nHe handed it over to me, and I read:\n\n    Come at once. Uncle Harrington murdered last night. Bring good\n    detective if you can, but do come.\n                                                              Zoe.\n\n\u201cThen as yet you know no details?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I suppose it will be in the evening papers. Without doubt the\npolice are in charge.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was about three o\u2019clock when we arrived at the little station of\nElmer\u2019s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small gray\nstone building in the midst of the rugged moors.\n\n\u201cA lonely place,\u201d I observed.\n\nHavering nodded.\n\n\u201cI shall try and get rid of it. I could never live here again.\u201d\n\nWe unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak\ndoor when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us.\n\n\u201cJapp!\u201d I ejaculated.\n\nThe Scotland Yard Inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before\naddressing my companion.\n\n\u201cMr. Havering, I think? I\u2019ve been sent down from London to take charge\nof this case, and I\u2019d like a word with you, if I may, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen your good lady, sir\u2014and the housekeeper. I wont keep you a\nmoment, but I\u2019m anxious to get back to the village now that I\u2019ve seen\nall there is to see here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know nothing as yet as to what\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEx-actly,\u201d said Japp soothingly. \u201cBut there are just one or two\nlittle points I\u2019d like your opinion about all the same. Captain\nHastings, here, he knows me, and he\u2019ll go on up to the house and tell\nthem you\u2019re coming.\u201d\n\nI went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door\nbehind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged\nwoman in black.\n\n\u201cMr. Havering will be here in a moment,\u201d I explained. \u201cHe has been\ndetained by the Inspector. I have come down with him from London to\nlook into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last\nnight?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome inside, sir.\u201d She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the\ndimly lighted hall. \u201cIt was after dinner last night, sir, that the man\ncame. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and seeing that he spoke the same\nway, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace\u2019s, and\nI showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He\nwouldn\u2019t give no name, which of course was a bit odd, now I come to\nthink of it.\n\n\u201cI told Mr. Pace, and he seemed puzzled, like, but he said to the\nmistress: \u2018Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.\u2019\nHe went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after\na while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarreling, and I came\nout into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too,\nand just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both\nran to the gun-room door, but it was locked, and we had to go round to\nthe window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and\nbleeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat became of the man?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk, it\nwas. They came back with me; and the constable, he stayed all night;\nand this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?\u201d\n\nThe housekeeper reflected.\n\n\u201cHe had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a\nlight overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American, I\ndidn\u2019t notice much about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. Now, I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector\nJapp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London\nis anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good, sir.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two\nor three hours start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to\nbe close at his heels.\n\nMrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a\nlight step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome\nyoung woman coming toward me. She wore a flame-colored jumper, that\nset off the slender boyishness of her figure. On her dark head was a\nlittle hat of flame-colored leather. Even the present tragedy could\nnot dim the vitality of her personality.\n\nI introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension.\n\n\u201cOf course I have often heard of you and your colleague, M. Poirot.\nYou have done some wonderful things together, haven\u2019t you? It was very\nclever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now, will you ask me\nquestions? That is the easiest way, isn\u2019t it, of getting to know all\nyou want to about this dreadful affair?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. Havering. Now, what time was it that this man\narrived?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must have been just before nine o\u2019clock. We had finished dinner,\nand were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour husband had already left for London?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he went up by the six-fifteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he go by car to the station, or did he walk?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur own car isn\u2019t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer\u2019s\nDale to fetch him in time for the train.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas Mr. Pace quite his usual self?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely\u2014most normal in every way.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, can you describe this visitor at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. I didn\u2019t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight\ninto the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did your uncle say?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five\nminutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out into\nthe hall, and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the\nshot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go\nround the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the\nmurderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle\u201d\u2014her voice\nfaltered\u2014\u201chad been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was\ndead, and I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police straight away. I was\ncareful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I\nfound it.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI nodded approval.\n\n\u201cNow, as to the weapon?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers\nof my husband\u2019s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I\npointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with\nthem. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know\nfor certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay I go to the gun-room?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been\nremoved.\u201d\n\nShe accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering\nentered the hall, and with a quick apology, his wife ran to him. I was\nleft to undertake my investigations alone.\n\nI may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In\ndetective-novels, clues abound, but here I could find nothing that\nstruck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the\ncarpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything\nwith painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with\nmy little camera, which I had brought with me. I also examined the\nground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily\ntrampled that I judged it was useless to waste time over it. Now I had\nseen all that Hunter\u2019s Lodge had to show me. I must go back to Elmer\u2019s\nDale and get into touch with Japp. Accordingly I took leave of the\nHaverings, and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from\nthe station.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nJapp I found at the Matlock Arms, and he took me forthwith to see the\nbody. Harrington Pace was a small, spare, cleanshaven man, typically\nAmerican in appearance. He had been shot through the back of the head,\nand the revolver had been discharged at close quarters.\n\n\u201cTurned away for a moment,\u201d remarked Japp, \u201cand the other fellow\nsnatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed over\nto us was fully loaded, and I suppose the other one was also. Curious\nwhat darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded revolvers\nhanging up on your wall!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think of the case?\u201d I asked as we left the gruesome\nchamber behind us.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d got my eye on Havering to begin with.... Oh, yes,\u201d\u2014noting\nmy exclamation of astonishment,\u2014\u201cHavering has one or two shady\nincidents in his past. When he was a boy at Oxford, there was some\nfunny business about the signature on one of his father\u2019s checks. All\nhushed up, of course. Then he\u2019s pretty heavily in debt now, and\nthey\u2019re the kind of debts he wouldn\u2019t like to go to his uncle about;\nwhereas you may be sure the uncle\u2019s will would be in his favor. Yes,\nI\u2019d got my eye on him, and that\u2019s why I wanted to speak to him before\nhe saw his wife; but their statements dovetail all right, and I\u2019ve\nbeen to the station, and there\u2019s no doubt whatever that he left by the\nsix-fifteen. That gets up to London about ten-thirty. He went straight\nto his club, he says, and if that\u2019s confirmed all right\u2014why, he\ncouldn\u2019t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o\u2019clock in a black\nbeard!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes\u2014I was going to ask you what you thought about that beard?\u201d\n\nJapp winked.\n\n\u201cI think it grew pretty fast\u2014grew in the five miles from Elmer\u2019s Dale\nto Hunter\u2019s Lodge. Americans that I\u2019ve met are mostly clean shaven. I\nquestioned the housekeeper first, and then her mistress, and their\nstories agree all right; but I\u2019m sorry Mrs. Havering didn\u2019t get a look\nat the fellow. She\u2019s a smart woman, and she might have noticed\nsomething that would set us on the track.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was\nable to add various further items of information before I posted the\nletter.\n\nThe bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a\nrevolver identical in size to the one held by the police. Furthermore,\nMr. Havering\u2019s movements on the night in question had been checked and\nverified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived\nin London by the train in question. And thirdly, a sensational\ndevelopment had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on\ncrossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway station that\nmorning, had observed a brown paper parcel stuck between the railings.\nOpening it, he found that it contained a revolver. He handed the\nparcel over to the local police station, and before night it was\nproved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us\nby Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it.\n\nAll this I added to my report. A wire from Poirot arrived while I was\nat breakfast the following morning:\n\n    Of course black-bearded man was not Havering. Only you or\n    Japp would have such an idea. Wire me description of\n    housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning. Same\n    of Mrs. Havering. Do not waste time taking photographs of\n    interiors. They are underexposed and not in the least\n    artistic.\n\nIt seemed to me that Poirot\u2019s style was unnecessarily facetious. I\nalso fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot, with\nfull facilities for handling the case. His request for a description\nof the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply\nridiculous, but I complied as well as I, a mere man, was able to. At\neleven a reply wire came from Poirot:\n\n    Advise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.\n\nDumfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his breath.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the goods, M. Poirot! If he says so, there\u2019s something in it.\nAnd I hardly noticed the woman! I don\u2019t know that I can go so far as\narresting her, but I\u2019ll have her watched. We\u2019ll go up right away and\ntake another look at her.\u201d\n\nBut it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet, middle-aged woman,\nwho had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin\nair. Her box had been left behind. It contained only ordinary wearing\napparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her\nwhereabouts.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could.\n\n\u201cI engaged her about three weeks ago, when Mrs. Emery, our former\nhousekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selboume\u2019s Agency in Mount\nSt.\u2014a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They\nsent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the\nnicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and\nnotified the Agency of the fact. I can\u2019t believe that there was\nanything wrong with her. She was such a nice, quiet woman.\u201d\n\nThe thing was certainly a mystery.\n\nWhile it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the\ncrime, since at the moment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with\nher in the hall, nevertheless she must have some connection with the\nmurder, or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt?\n\nI wired the latest development to Poirot, and suggested returning to\nLondon and making inquiries at Selbourne\u2019s Agency. Poirot\u2019s reply was\nprompt:\n\n    Useless to inquire at Agency. They will never have heard\n    of her. Find out what vehicle took her up to Hunter\u2019s\n    Lodge when she first arrived there.\n\nThough mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer\u2019s\nDale were limited. The local garage had two cars, and there were two\nstation flies. None of these had been requisitioned on the date in\nquestion. I may also mention that inquiries at the Agency in London\nbore out Poirot\u2019s prognostication. No such woman as \u201cMrs. Middleton\u201d\nhad ever been on their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs.\nHavering\u2019s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various\napplicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she\nomitted to mention which woman she had selected.\n\n    [It is suggested that the reader pause in his perusal of the story\n    at this point, make his own solution of the mystery\u2014and then see\n    how close he comes to that of the author\u2014The Editors.]\n\nSomewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established\nin an armchair by the fire. He greeted me with much affection.\n\n\u201c_Mon ami Hastings!_ But how glad I am to see you! Veritably I have\nfor you a great affection! And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run\nto and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated\nto your heart\u2019s content?\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I cried, \u201cthe thing\u2019s a dark mystery! It will never be\nsolved.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, indeed. It\u2019s a hard nut to crack.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, as far as that goes, me, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A\nveritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well\nenough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know? How did you find out?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth.....\nSee here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in\norder. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which\nat his death will doubtless pass to his nephew\u2014point number one. His\nnephew is known to be desperately hard up\u2014point number two. His nephew\nis also known to be\u2014shall we say a man of loose moral fiber? Point\nnumber three!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut  Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to\nLondon.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment!_ And therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer\u2019s Dale at\nsix-fifteen, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left\n(or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given\nwrongly when he examined the body), we conclude, quite rightly, that\nMr. Havering did _not_ shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering,\nHastings.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will be found.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that\nhousekeeper\u2014don\u2019t you think so? It struck me at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of\ntime.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what was her part?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I presume to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, that was not her part. Her part was what you have just\nmentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the\nshot was fired. And no one will ever find her, _mon ami_, because she\ndoes not exist! \u2018There\u2019s no sech person,\u2019 as your so great Shakespeare\nsays.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was Dickens,\u201d I murmured, smiling. \u201cBut what do you mean, Poirot?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you\nand Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim, middle-aged\nfigure in black with a faint, subdued voice, and finally that neither\nyou, nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever\nsaw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was a\nchild\u2019s play for that clever and daring woman. On the pretext of\nsummoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper\nand a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the gray\ntransformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed; a\nslight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down\nwith her clear ringing voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not\nhave placed it there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that was Roger Havering\u2019s job\u2014but it was a mistake on their part.\nIt put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a\nrevolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once; he\nwould not carry it up to London with him. No, the motive was clear;\nthe criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far\nremoved from Derbyshire; they were anxious to get the police away as\nsoon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter\u2019s Lodge. Of course, the\nrevolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot.\nRoger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London,\nwent straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly\nout to Ealing by the District Railway, a matter of about twenty\nminutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to\ntown. That charming creature his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after\ndinner\u2014you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant\npoint, that! She reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place,\nand then starts off with her desperate little comedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d I murmured, fascinated. \u201cAnd yet\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet it is true. _Bien s\u00fbr_, my friend, it is true! But to bring\nthat precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must\ndo what he can\u2014I have written him fully; but I very much fear,\nHastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate\u2014or _le bon\nDieu_\u2014whichever you prefer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wicked flourish like a green bay tree,\u201d I reminded him.\n\n\u201cBut at a price, Hastings, always at a price, _croyez moi_!\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nPoirot\u2019s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the\ntruth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence\nto insure a conviction. Mr. Pace\u2019s huge fortune passed into the hands\nof his murderers. Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I\nread in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were among\nthose killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris, I knew that\nJustice was satisfied.",
