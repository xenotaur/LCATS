    "body": "Pendleton had been away from San Francisco over two months. The airport\ntaxi left him at his place, where he showered and shaved. Then he\ndecided he would walk, down through Chinatown and over into North\nBeach, to Beth's apartment.\n\nIt was a warm Saturday afternoon and he unbuttoned his dacron blazer\na block or so into Chinatown. He smiled as he wandered by the bright\nrestaurants and shops, the rows of ivory Buddhas in window after\nwindow. On one corner Pendleton stopped and took a deep breath,\nwatching a scattering of tourists taking pictures of each other.\nSomeone had lost a half dozen fortune cookies on the sidewalk and they\ncrackled and spread fragments and fortunes as people passed.\n\nWhile he was waiting for a signal to change, three small Chinese boys\ncharged a fourth who had ducked around Pendleton. They all ran around\nthe corner and Pendleton looked after them. There was an old curio and\ntoy shop there. He went toward its streaked window, trying to identify\nthe objects. Some kind of procession of tin soldiers made up the main\ndisplay. The door of the shop opened and an old man with a flared white\nbeard came out. His dark suit hung loose on him and his tie was coming\nuntied as he hurried away.\n\nThe old man brushed by Pendleton, nudging him. \"Many pardons,\" he said,\ncutting across the street. He ran downhill, weaving a little, and into\nan alley.\n\nThe bells over the toy shop door rattled again. \"Stop, thief!\" shouted\nthe fat Chinese, who came running up to Pendleton. The man shouted\nagain and stopped on the corner, his hands on his hips, looking.\n\nPendleton crossed the street and turned down the alley the old man had\nused. This would cut off a block of the way to Beth's. He had kept\nquiet about the thief because he didn't want to get involved in a lot\nof delaying questioning.\n\n\n\nHalfway down the alley he saw an arm dangling out of a garbage can.\nPendleton blinked and approached the shadowed area around the can. He\nflipped the lid up and the coat sleeve that had been tangled on the\ncan edge slipped free and dropped into the can. If the old man was\nwandering around naked, they shouldn't have much trouble catching him.\n\nPendleton liked the pre-quake apartment house Beth lived in. In almost\nany weather he liked to see its narrow brown wood front waiting there\nin the middle of the block. He smiled as a big blue-gray gull flew low\noverhead and then circled up and away behind Beth's building. Pendleton\ntook the rough steps in twos and threes and swung at Beth's bell. There\nwas a folded note for him glued on her mail box lid with Scotch tape.\nIt told him she might be delayed a bit and to get her keys from under\nthe rubber-plant pot on the porch and let himself in. He did that,\nthinking again that Beth's notes always looked as though she wrote them\non horseback.\n\nUpstairs he dropped her keys on the small mantle over the small real\nfireplace. Her bedroom door was slightly open. Just as he noticed this,\nBeth called out to him.\n\n\"I hope that's you, Ben?\" she said from her room.\n\n\"Where'll I put the ice, lady?\" he said. \"You're supposed to be out.\"\n\n\"Welcome back. I just got here and I had to change so I left the keys\ndown there in case you got here while I was changing. How was New York?\"\n\n\"Okay, but I'm glad I'm with the agency out here. How'd you get in\nwithout keys?\" He sat down in the soft tan sofa-chair he'd given her.\n\n\"I have a key to the kitchen way. Is the show all right now?\"\n\n\"I guess we fixed it for a while. How are you?\"\n\n\"Fine. And, hey, I have a good part in Alex' new play. It just happened\nand I couldn't write.\"\n\n\"You have lousy handwriting, you know,\" Pendleton called. Grinning,\nhe got out a cigarette and reached into his coat pocket for a book of\nmatches. Something jabbed into the palm of his hand.\n\n\"It's because I'm so intense,\" Beth said, near her bedroom door.\n\nPendleton winced and pulled a small toy Chinese junk out of the pocket.\nThe price stamp was still on the bottom of the boat, 25 cents. The old\nman must have dropped it in his pocket when he nudged him.\n\nBeth came up behind him. \"It's warm in here. Give me your coat. I have\na whole new concept about making martinis. This fellow in Actors' Lab\ntold me. You do it with Zen.\" Her hands rested on Pendleton's shoulders.\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" he said, rubbing his palm with the boat as he stood.\n\nBeth slid her arms over his shoulders and locked her hands on his\nchest. \"What's that, Ben?\"\n\nPendleton turned around in her hold. He tapped her tanned nose with the\ntoy boat and told her about it. \"I suppose I should take it back,\" he\nsaid finally.\n\nBeth laughed. \"Makes you a receiver of stolen goods.\" She took the\ntoy boat and walked to the fireplace. She put it next to her keys and\nturned to him. She was wearing a light blue dress with a flared skirt.\nNo stockings, flat black shoes. She'd cut her blonde hair short since\nhe'd seen her last. \"Welcome back,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\n\nA light wind was starting up, tapping windows with tree branches, as\nPendleton let himself into Beth's darkening apartment. He flipped the\nlight switch on and started for the tan sofa chair, jiggling the keys\nin his hand. The bedroom door slammed.\n\n\"You in there?\" Pendleton called. Her note said she'd gone out for some\nforgotten groceries.\n\nPendleton opened the bedroom door and turned on the lights. The window\nbeyond Beth's low, blue-covered bed was open and the wind was flapping\nthe curtains against her dressing table. A strong flap caught a\nlipstick and flipped it into the thick rug.\n\nEdging around the bed, Pendleton closed the window and picked up the\nlipstick. He left the bedroom door a bit open and went back to the\nchair. There was a paper back by Eisenstein on the coffee table and he\npicked that up and read down the contents page.\n\nThe wind got stronger and parts of the old building creaked, first\nsomething down under him, then something way up and to the right. Now\nand then there would be a bang from out in back. Pendleton dropped the\nbook and got down on his knees in front of the fireplace and kindled a\nfire. As the fire took hold, bright sparks popped out into the room.\n\nSomething started tapping on the window behind Pendleton's chair. At\nlast, in a lull between creaking and banging, he became aware of a\ntapping. He looked at the window and the early night sky. The tapping\nwent on.\n\nThere was a gray cat sitting on the sill outside. The cat was tangled\nup in an orange and blue bead necklace. \"Lonely out there,\" Pendleton\nsaid. He didn't much like cats, but this one looked sad. He opened the\nwindow and the cat jumped in, the necklace falling free and clattering\nagainst the wall. \"We'll see if maybe Beth's got something around to\ngive to wandering cats.\" Pendleton reached out to pick up the cat.\nSputtering, the animal raked at his fingers and dived between his legs.\n\nPendleton spun and saw the cat scoot through the open bedroom door.\n\"Hey, you little bastard, you'll knock over things.\"\n\nHe was two steps from the door when it slammed and locked. Pendleton\nstopped, wondering how the animal had managed to bang into the door\nhard enough to close it. He didn't think the cat should stay in there\nand anyway Beth would want to get in when she got home. He'd pick the\nlock. Crouching, he reached for the knob. Something clicked and the\ndoor swung in. He recognized Beth's terry robe and he looked up and saw\nher face, very pale.\n\n\"Okay,\" she said. \"I guess I was too cute with the key bits. Go away,\nBen, and leave me alone. Please?\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" He was still squatting and her stepping forward\nsent him over.\n\n\"Just go away, Ben. Please, now.\" She brushed by him and sat in a\nbucket chair, putting both bare feet down hard on the floor.\n\nBen got himself up. \"You drunk?\"\n\n\n\nBeth brushed at her hair. \"I thought if you were sitting out here and I\nshowed up in the bedroom, you'd think I came in the back way. Or that\nI was already in there and just hadn't heard you.\" She bit her thumb.\n\"Just another trick I wanted to try.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" He bent and scooped up the bead necklace.\n\n\"Go away. That's all.\"\n\n\"Well, why?\" He twisted the string of beads around his knuckles.\n\"Somebody else?\"\n\n\"Yes. Alex.\" She smiled.\n\n\"Alex? That fruiter who runs the Actors' Lab.\" The string broke and\nbeads splattered away from him. Three landed in the fire.\n\n\"Or maybe my Uncle Russ. Did you know we lived with him for three\nyears when I was a kid and I was always having odd fevers and things?\nHe had some kind of quack x-ray business.\"\n\nPendleton took Beth's shoulders. \"You're sick, is that it?\"\n\n\"No. Go away, Ben.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\nBeth sighed, annoyed. \"You know about Method. You have to feel the\nparts, live them.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nBeth shrugged her shoulders until Pendleton let go. \"One weekend\nafternoon--oh, about two or three weeks after the agency sent you\noff--I was here trying to be an old lady. For an exercise at the Lab.\nAnd I was.\"\n\nPendleton blinked at her still pale fact. \"That's swell, Beth. A guy\nlikes to know what his fiancee is up to while he's away.\"\n\n\"I _was_ an old lady.\" She stood with her body thrust almost against\nhim. \"See? I changed.\"\n\nHe backed a little. \"How about a drink?\"\n\n\"Don't you get it, Ben? How the hell do you think I just came in?\"\n\n\"The back way.\" Pendleton decided to try a drink on her and then find\nout who her doctor was these days.\n\n\"I was the cat. Now you know about it and can go away, Ben.\" She let\nherself fall to the floor and she huddled there, crying.\n\n\"How long have you had this idea?\" He knelt beside her, running one\nhand over her back.\n\n\"You know who put that silly damn boat in your pocket?\" she asked.\n\n\"Sure. You were that little old man.\"\n\nBeth rolled and sat up, her legs tangled in the robe. She took a deep\nbreath. \"Listen, Ben. I got a kick out of changing into different kinds\nof people. It was a help in my work at the Actors' Lab. Then I got the\nidea it would be fun to try other things. Animals, chairs, tables. One\nrainy night I was a footstool until it was time to go to bed.\"\n\n\"I was a tea kettle as a boy. Stop kidding.\"\n\n\"I don't know, Ben. It gets sort of vacant all around when you're away\nsomewhere. I had this feeling that I wanted to see if I could just step\ninto a store or someplace and try to swipe something. Anything.\"\n\n\n\nPendleton found himself starting to shake. He put his arms around Beth.\n\"That was you, then, taking junk from an old Chinese.\"\n\n\"I could change, you see, and take things as all sorts of odd\ncharacters. If I was spotted and followed, I'd try to duck in an alley\nor a doorway and change again. The clothes are extra. Sometimes I could\nhide clothes in a lot. Most of the time, though, I'd have to change\ninto something new. A bird, a cat. Then I'd carry what I had stolen\nin my beak or around my neck.\" She laughed softly. \"Once I copped an\numbrella and changed into a big dog and went off with it in my mouth.\"\nShe twisted slightly in his arms. \"I'm sorry. It's all sort of odd and\nsilly. I do it.\"\n\n\"Well, why?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Beth?\" He inched up, lifting her with him.\n\n\"Yes?\" She let him sit her in the sofa chair.\n\n\"You have to go see somebody. You have to stop.\"\n\nShe stiffened. \"If it was as simple as insanity, I would.\"\n\n\"Please, Beth.\" He wandered to the fireplace and threw in more wood.\n\n\"The stealing _does_ bother me. I think the changing is good. I can\nuse it to really go someplace in my acting career. Quit the secretary\nbusiness altogether. I actually changed to an old woman for one of\nAlex's one-acters. He thought I'd just done a good job of makeup. I\ndon't believe I want to simply stop, Ben.\"\n\n\"You have to!\"\n\n\"Don't start shouting commands.\"\n\nPendleton sat across from her on the sofa. \"Will you promise to start\nseeing somebody? Maybe I can find out about a good man. Promise you'll\nsee him.\"\n\n\"You going to ask around? Why don't you do a TV spot? 'We are happy to\nannounce that Beth Gershwin is daffy.'\"\n\n\"Relax, Beth. You decide what you want to do. I won't talk to anybody.\"\n\nBeth moved to the window. The wind had died. \"I don't know, Ben.\"\n\n\"Let it rest. Let's have the drink.\" He came to her side.\n\n\"I think I'd like to be alone for a while.\"\n\n\"I'd like to stay.\"\n\n\"I'd like you to go. Please.\"\n\n\"Beth.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ben.\" She stared at him, then walked into her bedroom.\n\nShe didn't close the door and he followed.\n\nHer robe was spread-eagled on the bed. Pendleton looked around the\nroom. Before, there had been one carved stool at the vanity table. Now\nthere were two.\n\nPendleton left the apartment and ran down the hall, taking short,\nshallow breaths. But he couldn't just leave her. He bit his lip and\nwent back through the still open door.\n\n\"Come on, Beth. Don't be stubborn,\" he said into the bedroom, watching\nthe two stools.\n\nHe waited an hour. Then he turned off the lights and started to\nleave. Going out this time, he stepped on one of the wooden beads and\nalmost fell onto the coffee table.\n\nPendleton slammed Beth's door and went out into the clear night. If she\ncould be stubborn, so could he.\n\n\n\nIt was almost two weeks before she called him to apologize. She'd\ngot him at the agency. He didn't stay in his apartment much. He kept\ntalking to himself if he did.\n\nYou could see the street from the little Italian restaurant they'd\nagreed to meet in. Pendleton sat at a round table close to the wide\nwindow and watched for Beth. There was a slight haze in the afternoon\nair and most of the secretaries that passed were coatless.\n\nBeth started smiling a quarter of a block from him. She was in a light\ncotton dress, weaving in and out of the noontime pedestrians.\n\n\"Nice day,\" Pendleton said, standing.\n\nBeth smiled and sat down. \"I noticed that right off.\"\n\nThey ordered and Pendleton said, \"How've you been?\"\n\n\"Great.\" She clasped her hands together on the checkered table top.\n\"You were right, Ben. I'm sorry I was mean.\"\n\nPendleton moved his glass of water three inches. \"Good.\"\n\n\"I've started seeing a very highly recommended analyst. Things are\nstarting to look up. I haven't even had an impulse to filch anything in\ndays.\"\n\nThe food arrived. \"It'll take time.\"\n\n\"I have a great part in Alex's next play. It's really a challenge. By\nIonesco. Being able to change will help.\"\n\nPendleton set his fork down. \"Huh?\"\n\n\"I tried changing into the character last night. It came off fine.\"\n\n\"What are you seeing a psychiatrist for, then?\" he asked, his voice low.\n\n\"So I won't steal things any more.\"\n\nHe held the edge of the table for a minute, not meeting her eyes.\nFinally he said, \"I see. Well, that's fine, Beth. How've things been at\nwork?\"\n\nBeth grinned and told him.\n\n\n\nThe days were turning cool and the trees had started scattering dry\nleaves into the wind. On a sharp weekend afternoon Pendleton was\nkilling time in the produce district before driving over to Beth's.\n\nThere was a coffee shop open and Pendleton thought about crossing over\nfor a cup of coffee. The whitewashed door of the place shot open and\na fat woman with an orange-fringed shawl came out. She was carrying\nsomething wrapped up in a paper napkin. She glanced at Pendleton,\nhesitated a second and then went running off toward a closed warehouse.\nBy the time she reached it, the short-order cook was on the street\nlooking after her. He threw a gesture after her and went back inside.\n\nPendleton shivered once slightly. He started walking for his car and a\nblock from it he found himself running. He got to Beth's place ahead of\nthe approaching dusk.\n\nThe downstairs door wasn't locked, but Beth's apartment door didn't\nopen when he tried it. Pendleton grunted, slapping his pockets for\nsomething to pick the lock with.\n\nThe door opened. Beth, in capris and a striped sweater, looked out at\nhim, her head tilted slightly to one side. \"Did I hear applause? You're\nearly.\"\n\n\"You know why I'm here early.\" He pushed into the room. \"I thought you\nwere better. What the hell were you doing down there?\"\n\n\"Where? What's the matter?\" She backed across the rug to the fireplace.\nA small fire was going and she turned to warm her hands at it.\n\n\"I just saw you steal something from that diner. Silverware maybe. You\nwant me to search the place?\"\n\nFacing him, her lips hardly parted, Beth said, \"I should think you\nwould trust me, being we love each other and all. I was rehearsing\nuntil a half hour ago and Alex dropped me off. I've been here since\nthen.\"\n\nPendleton's hands fell to his sides. \"Well, nothing I guess is wrong.\nI'm just jumpy. This changing thing bothers me.\"\n\nBeth reached out and patted his arm. \"It's okay, Ben?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He sat down in the tan chair and looked up at her.\n\n\"Want to eat here tonight, by the fire? I'll have the Flying Something\ndeliver food.\"\n\n\"Good. And send out for a bottle or two.\"\n\nBeth bent and kissed him. \"Trust me again?\"\n\nHe brushed at her hair and nodded.\n\n\n\nPendleton dropped too much wood into the fireplace and a stick snapped\nout onto the rug. He gingerly picked up the stick and poked it back\ninto the flames. He went back to the low sofa Beth was on. He found his\nglass in the dark and refilled it from the pitcher.\n\nBeth reached out with one bare foot and stroked the side of his head.\nShe had put on a dark blue dress with several stiff lace petticoats and\nwhenever he tried to touch her she made crackling sounds.\n\n\"You're really a nice fellow,\" Beth said, finding his ear with her toe.\n\n\"So are you,\" he said, finishing his drink.\n\n\"Maybe we should go ahead and get married.\"\n\nBen agreed and poured fresh drinks.\n\n\"Ben?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" She was crying.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"It _was_ me this afternoon. I _have_ been doing those things. I never\nwent to any highly recommended man at all.\"\n\nPendleton felt tolerant. \"So what? Things will work out somehow.\"\n\n\n\nBeth sat up. \"I can't stop it, Ben.\"\n\nPendleton thought he heard an odd quaver in her voice. \"You're not\nonstage now, kid. Save the phony touches.\"\n\nHer leg swung round, just missing his head, and she stood up. \"That's\nyour trouble. You're totally incapable of comprehending.\"\n\n\"I comprehend you. You're loony and a liar.\"\n\nBeth slapped him. \"It'll be simpler if I stop being me!\"\n\nPendleton had somehow gotten his arm stuck under the sofa. \"Take it\neasy.\"\n\nHe was aware of a rustling sound and when he got loose and came up he\nsaw Beth naked by the window for an instant. As he looked she changed.\nThen there were two tan sofa chairs in the room.\n\nPendleton called Beth's name over and over, but she wouldn't come back.\nIt got cold in the apartment after a time and he threw all the wood\nhe could find in the fire. He crawled over to the martini pitcher and\ndrank from it. He noticed that some sticks had fallen out and landed in\nthe tangle of petticoats Beth had left and he smiled at the disorder of\neverything and put his head back against the sofa.\n\nPetticoats crackling woke him. Even before he got his head up very high\nin the room, he was coughing. The room was turning bright, sparkling\norange.\n\n\"Beth!\" he said. \"Beth!\"\n\nThere were still the two tan sofa chairs.\n\n\"Beth, sober up now! Come on, change! We've got to get out!\"\n\nNothing happened. Pendleton looked at the chairs a moment. The one on\nthe left. He grabbed it up and wavered to the apartment door. To make\nsure, he'd have to come up for the other one.\n\nFor several minutes it seemed the chair would stay wedged in the\ndoorway. It came free finally and he went back with it and tumbled and\ntwisted down the stairs.\n\n\n\nA siren met him in the cold night outside. The engines were already\nthere. The firemen were heading for the building.\n\nSpray fell back across the street where Pendleton took the chair.\n\"Beth, please,\" he said in a low voice. \"Change now.\" He tried to go\nget the other chair, to be sure, but they wouldn't let him.\n\nHe fell into the one he'd picked and began crying softly. The sirens\nstopped. Before he let the ambulance people look at him, he insisted\nthat the chair be looked after.\n\nNo trace of Beth was found and Pendleton couldn't explain what had\nhappened. After they let him go, he had the chair sent to his apartment.\n\nHe put it very carefully in the living room by the liquor cabinet and\nsat down near it to wait.\n\n\n\n\n",
