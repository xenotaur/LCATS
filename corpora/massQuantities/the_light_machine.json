I ain\u2019t blind.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you see a automobile when it\u2019s going past a hundred miles a\nhour?\u201d Tubby pointed a fat little forefinger directly into the first\nman\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWhy, why, yes,\u201d said the first man, surprised into confusion.\n\n\u201cAnd can you see the _spokes_ of a automobile wheel when it\u2019s going\npast a hundred miles a hour?\u201d\n\nThe first man thought a moment. \u201cWhy, why, no,\u201d he said finally.\n\nTubby lowered his forefinger. \u201cThen that proves it ain\u2019t so,\u201d he\ndeclared triumphantly. \u201cNor you couldn\u2019t see a bullet if I shot it\npast your nose, could you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t, Jake,\u201d the second man put in.\n\n\u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cNor you couldn\u2019t see light if it\nwent that fast neither. Ain\u2019t I right? Could you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, Jake,\u201d said the second man.\n\nTubby sat down.\n\n\u201cWell, _he_ said,\u201d the first man resumed unabashed\u2014\u201che said as how\nlight travels one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles in a second.\nAnd furthermore, and in addition, he said as how some of the stars\nwere so far away that it takes the light hundreds and hundreds of\nyears just getting here from them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was all in the movie,\u201d said the second man wearily. \u201c\u2018The\nWonders of Light\u2019\u2014I remember it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, _I_ don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cBecause I know it ain\u2019t\nso\u2014not none of it.\u201d\n\nHe stood up again; then with sudden thought he waddled across the\nroom to the open window.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, commandingly; the two other men joined him.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t them stars up there?\u201d he asked. He pointed through the open\ncasement to a brilliant, cloudless summer evening sky.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014them\u2019s stars all right,\u201d the first man agreed. \u201cIf that\u2019s what\nyou mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat _ain\u2019t_ what I mean,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cI said, \u2018Ain\u2019t them stars\nup there?\u2019 Are they up there, or ain\u2019t they? That\u2019s what I want to\nknow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re up there all right, Jake,\u201d said the second man.\n\n\u201cIf you can see them, mustn\u2019t they be there?\u201d Tubby persisted.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the first man. \u201cWhen you can see them they must be\nthere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d said Tubby\u2014he paused impressively\u2014\u201cthen the light of them\nmust be here and there at the same time. Am I right?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, Jake,\u201d said the second man. \u201c\u2019Cause if it took the\nlight a hundred years to get here we couldn\u2019t see them for a hundred\nyears yet. Am I right?\u201d\n\nThe first man went back to the stove. Tubby and the second man\njoined him after a moment.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t telling you what _I_ think,\u201d the first man remarked. \u201cI\u2019m\ntelling you what _he_ said\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t got no sense,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201c_I\u2019m_ going to the movies,\u201d said the second man abruptly. \u201cCome\non.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cI ate too much. I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018The Burning of Rome,\u2019\u201d said the first man. \u201cNero playing the\npiano while the city burns. Come on. It\u2019s good\u2014I seen the pictures.\u201d\n\nAnd reluctantly Tubby allowed himself to be led away.\n\nThe little Moving Picture Theater was hot and stuffy; Tubby found an\naisle seat with his friends, near the back. For a quarter of an hour\nor more he sat blinking at the flickering screen. The Topical Review\ninterested him not at all; he yawned and squeezed his fat little\nbody lower into the hard narrow seat.\n\nThen the picture changed. It was not \u201cThe Burning of Rome\u201d yet, but\na short picture, evidently science. Tubby frowned at it in silence.\n\nThe first man nudged him. \u201cWake up,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s a astronomical\npicture about the stars. Wake up. It\u2019ll be good. \u2018The Burning of\nRome\u2019s\u2019 next.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t asleep.\u201d Tubby whispered back. \u201cI\u2019m thinking.\u201d\n\nThe wonders of celestial space were unfolding before Tubby\u2019s eyes.\nBut he hardly saw them. He was thinking of what Jake had said\u2014those\ntremendous figures Jake had reeled off to him. What was it he had\nsaid? One hundred and eighty-six thousand miles in a second. There\nwere sixty seconds in a minute, and sixty minutes in an hour! That\nwould be\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2019Taint so,\u201d he muttered to himself doggedly.\n\nHe felt a light touch on his arm and looked up to see a little man\nstanding beside him in the aisle. In the dim light Tubby could not\nsee the little man very well; but he _could_ see that he did not\nknow him.\n\nThe little man bent down toward Tubby\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cI want to talk to you,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d said Tubby.\n\nThe little man shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t talk in here. Come outside\nfor a moment.\u201d\n\nTubby hesitated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important,\u201d the little man added. \u201cYou must come\u2014just for\na moment. I\u2019ve wanted to see you for a very long time.\u201d\n\nTubby clambered to his feet; his two friends, absorbed in the\npicture before them, did not notice him leave. In silence he\nfollowed the stranger back up the aisle to the lighted theater\nlobby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to see you for a long time,\u201d the little man repeated.\nTubby could see now he was a very little man, with a thin, frail\nbody and a very big head set upon a long spindly neck. His hair was\nsnow-white and long about his ears. His yellow face was seamed with\nlines, but most of it was hidden by flowing side-whiskers and by a\npair of huge iron-rimmed spectacles. He wore a long black frock coat\nthat hung from his thin shoulders like a shroud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a professor,\u201d said the stranger. He held out a shriveled,\ntaloned hand. \u201cA Professor of Light,\u201d he added impressively.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cMy name is Obadiah Oats.\u201d\n\nTubby shook hands. \u201cMine\u2019s Tubby,\u201d he said. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d\n\nThe professor put on his high hat, which made him nearly as tall as\nTubby.\n\n\u201cI want to consult you on a matter of very great importance to both\nof us,\u201d he said slowly.\n\nTubby waited.\n\n\u201cAbout light,\u201d the professor added. He linked his arm in Tubby\u2019s\nconfidentially. \u201cI need your help. They tell me you\u2019re the smartest\nman in town. I wanted to find you. With a brain like yours and\nmine\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby breathlessly, when the professor paused.\n\n\u201cMy laboratory\u2019s right across the street,\u201d said the little man.\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d Tubby followed the professor out of the theater,\nthrough a little doorway across the street and up several flights of\nrickety stairs into a room on the top floor of the house.\n\n\u201cThis is where I work,\u201d said the professor. \u201cSit down.\u201d\n\nIt was a large room with endless row of bottles upon tiers of\nshelves lining its walls. Several long tables stood about, and Tubby\nsaw they were crowded with curious apparatus\u2014little tubes in racks,\nmicroscopes, triangular pieces of glass with candles behind them,\nand several contrivances of wheels and weights that looked like\nclock works. In the exact center of the room was one larger\napparatus of a sort Tubby had never seen before; it seemed very\ncomplicated and he stared at it with awe. He could make nothing out\nof it except that part of it was a huge telescope, extending up\nthrough the skylight of the room. He glanced upward, and there,\nthrough a narrow, open slit in the glass, he could see the stars\nshining.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a Light Machine,\u201d said the professor, following his glance.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one in the world, and there it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most wonderful machine that was ever built,\u201d the professor\nwent on softly. \u201cI built it; and now _you_ are going to help me make\nmoney out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what _you_ are going to tell _me_. Don\u2019t you see? I am a man\nof science\u2014you are a business man. That\u2019s the difference between\nus.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cFirst I\u2019ll have to explain. You have a head for figures, of\ncourse?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014yes,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t know much about light?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014no,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cNaturally. How could you. Nobody does\u2014but me. And I know all about\nit\u2014_all_.\u201d He emphasized the last word impressively. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m\ngoing to tell it to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you very much,\u201d said Tubby, and waited.\n\n\u201cAll my life,\u201d began the professor\u2014he spoke softly; his eyes, fixed\non Tubby seemed staring at dim, distant spaces\u2014\u201call my life\u2014since I\nwas a little boy\u2014I have been studying the properties of light. It is\na very wonderful thing\u2014you realize that, do you not\u2014the most\nwonderful thing in the whole of science?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Tubby.\n\nThe professor drew in a deep breath, like a long sigh reversed.\n\u201cLight,\u201d he began again, \u201cis a vibratory wave in the Ether. You know\nwhat the Ether is?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cIt is like air. But you cannot breathe it. It exists\neverywhere\u2014even in the outermost realms of Space. Now do you\nunderstand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cLight is vibration of the Ether,\u201d the professor went on in his\ndroning voice. \u201cIts vibrations travel through the Ether at the rate\nof one hundred and eighty-six thousand three hundred and twenty-four\nmiles a second.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know _that_,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cYou are a learned man,\u201d the professor said admiringly. \u201cYou have a\nwonderful mind. I knew you had\u2014they said so.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\nThe professor jerked his little body upright in his chair suddenly,\nso suddenly that Tubby started violently with fright.\n\n\u201cHow long is a second?\u201d the professor asked aggressively.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2014tick-tick. That\u2019s it,\u201d said Tubby.\n\nThe professor relaxed in his chair. \u201cYou _are_ a clever man. You\nwill have your little joke.\n\n\u201cBut we must be serious. I will tell you how long a second is. It is\nexactly one-thirty-one millionth, five hundred and fifty-eight\nthousandth, one hundred and forty-ninth part of a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cDo you know what a year is?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree hundred and sixty-five days,\u201d said Tubby promptly.\n\nThe professor smiled again. \u201cA year is the time it takes the Earth\nto revolve once around the Sun. Thus you see there are 31,558,149\nseconds in a year\u2014which is a little more than 365\u00bc days.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow to find out how far light travels in a year we simply take its\nspeed per second and multiply it by sixty. That is its speed per\nminute. Multiply that by sixty gives it speed per hour and so on up\nto a day or a year. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cHow\u2014how far does it go in a year?\u201d\n\nThe professor raised his hand.\n\n\u201c_That_ is a very simple problem\u2014only mental arithmetic for me.\nWait. Let us go further.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe distance Light travels in one year is called a Light-year. Now,\nsome of the stars are so far away that it takes light many centuries\nto come from them, traveling at that speed I have just mentioned.\nThus we measure their distance from us as so many hundred\nLight-years. Do you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cHow\u2014how many miles away from us is the farthest\nstar\u2014the very farthest?\u201d\n\nThe professor leaped to his feet. \u201cAh, I was expecting you to ask\nthat.\u201d His face was beaming. \u201cYou _are_ a clever man. But I\u2019m ready\nfor you. I figured it all out this afternoon and wrote it down. I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n\nHe led Tubby to a corner of the room. Tubby saw a perfectly enormous\nroll of narrow paper tape, like the tape that comes from a stock\nticker, or is rolled up around baby ribbon. Only this roll was\nbigger than he was. It was hung vertically on a spindle, which had a\nhandle to rotate it so that the tape could be unwound and wound\nagain easily. A few feet away there was a similar spindle, but\nempty.\n\n\u201cI wrote it down for you,\u201d the professor repeated\u2014\u201cthe distance in\nmiles of the furthest star from the Earth. I wrote it down\u2014on this.\u201d\n\nHe took the loose end of the tape and reeling off a few feet hooked\nthe end onto the empty spindle.\n\n\u201cWatch closely,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to show you the number.\u201d\n\nHe started to wind up the tape on the empty spindle. Tubby stood\nclose beside the strip of tape stretching the space between the two\nspindles; it passed directly under his face.\n\n\u201cWatch closely,\u201d said the professor again. \u201cThere comes the first of\nit.\u201d Tubby saw a row of little digits start on the tape. The first\nthree were 154. Then after the comma began a string of ciphers;\nafter each three ciphers was another comma. The moving tape carried\nthis endless row of little ciphers swiftly under Tubby\u2019s nose. He\nstared at them fascinated. Faster and faster they flew by as the\nroll of tape wound up on the spindle the professor was turning. For\nhalf an hour he turned briskly. Then the row of ciphers stopped just\nas the other end of the tape fluttered off the unwinding spindle.\n\nThe professor leaned against the wall, breathing hard.\n\n\u201cThat\u2014was\u2014the\u2014number,\u201d he gasped.\n\nTubby blinked. \u201cWhat\u2014what number was it?\u201d he asked finally.\n\nThe professor recovered his breath and sat down again in his chair\nwearily.\n\n\u201cIt was one hundred and fifty-four zin-tillions,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe\nlargest number that has ever been written down. Wrote it down this\nafternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cIt _was_ a big number.\u201d\n\nThe professor pulled at his side-whiskers thoughtfully. \u201cWe must get\non,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you understand how far the stars are away. And\nhow fast light travels. That brings us to my Light Machine.\u201d\n\nTubby sat up with interest. \u201cTo the Light Machine. Yes, go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you can see,\u201d the professor continued. \u201cI know all about Light\u2014I\nam its master. No one in the world knows as much about Light as I\ndo. And only one man in the world thinks he does.\u201d The professor\u2019s\neyes gleamed vindictively. \u201cAh, how I hate him, that man!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Tubby asked with interest. \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis name is Einstein,\u201d answered the professor. \u201cI hate him\u2014I loathe\nhim\u2014I despise him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he cannot harm _me_. I\u2019m too clever for him. And _you_ will\nhelp me. We still have time\u2014he cannot prove anything yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014yes,\u201d said Tubby.\n\nThe professor stood up. \u201cLet us get on with my invention. _Then_\nyou\u2019ll see what a wonderful man I am. I will be brief.\u201d\n\nTubby joined him beside the telescope in the center of the room.\n\n\u201cWhat you must understand first,\u201d said the professor, \u201cis _my_\ntheory of Light.\u201d Tubby waited.\n\n\u201cNo light is ever destroyed,\u201d the professor continued. \u201cIt passes\nbeyond our vision, that is all. But it always exists somewhere, in\nthe outer realms of Space.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where it goes when it goes out,\u201d Tubby put in. \u201cAin\u2019t I\nright?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the professor. \u201cThat\u2019s where it goes\u2014out into the realms\nof Space.\n\n\u201cNow what you must understand is that light can be reflected,\nrefracted, polarized, but never destroyed.\u201d He pointed to his\ninstruments on one of the tables. \u201c_I_ can do all those things to\nit\u2014and a thousand more\u2014but I cannot destroy it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cBut if you put it out you can\u2019t never get it\nback, can you now?\u201d\n\nThe professor beamed on him genially. \u201cYour brain works too keenly,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cYou anticipate me. No, _I_ cannot get it back. But it\ncomes back. That\u2019s just the point\u2014it comes back. That\u2019s what nobody\nin the world knows except me\u2014me and you.\n\n\u201cThe sun,\u201d he went on, \u201cgives us most of our light\u2014it gets here to\nthe earth from the sun in a few minutes. The moon gives us reflected\nsunlight. It is the same light, only it comes to us from the sun by\nway of the moon. It takes a little longer that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much?\u201d Tubby asked.\n\n\u201cNot much\u2014just a few seconds\u2014the moon is not far away. Now all this\nlight that strikes the earth is reflected back into space. In a\nhundred years\u2014less or more according to the distance\u2014it strikes the\ndifferent stars. There it mingles with other light. And then, mark\nme well, and then\u201d\u2014the professor paused impressively\u2014\u201cthen in\nanother hundred years it comes back to us again\u2014the same light\u2014mixed\nwith other light of course\u2014but some of the same light we had two\nhundred years before. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014yes,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said the professor, \u201cis the _Oats Theory of the Rationality\nof Light_. I call it that because it _is_ rational\u2014it is in\naccordance with all known physical laws.\n\n\u201cSome others I could name\u201d\u2014the professor\u2019s voice shook with\nsuppressed passion; his eyes gleamed again wickedly\u2014\u201csome others are\nnot so scrupulous. _Their_ theories do _not_ coincide with\nrecognized physical laws\u2014they transgress them all. Mere astronomical\noutcasts\u2014mathematical lepers\u2014scientific pariahs\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2014you mean that other guy?\u201d said Tubby.\n\nThe professor calmed himself with an effort. He pulled a huge black\nsilk handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his dripping forehead.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t talk of him,\u201d he said after a moment.\n\n\u201cNo, we better leave him out of it,\u201d Tubby agreed. \u201cAin\u2019t I right?\u201d\n\nThe professor nodded. \u201cNow we come to _my_ great discovery. I\u2019ll\ntell you about that now.\n\n\u201cWhen this sunlight is reflected from the moon to us, it brings with\nit an image of the moon, which was not in the light when it left\nthe sun. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014yes,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we can see the moon\u2014the light brings us the image. All\nlight carries an image of something\u2014that\u2019s why we can see things.\n\n\u201cNow when light leaves the earth and goes out into space it takes\nwith it an image of the earth and everything that is happening on\nthe earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow some of this light may have to travel a hundred years before it\nreaches a star. When it does it mixes with other light and is\nreflected back in another hundred years to us. But\u2014mark you this\u2014but\nit still carries the image of the earth and what happened on the\nearth when it was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t see _that_,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cWe see the star. Ain\u2019t I\nright?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the professor. \u201cOf course you\u2019re right. And the reason\nwe see the star is because that image is the last one the light got.\nThat is predominate. All the others are there\u2014but they are hidden\naway beneath the star image.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Tubby.\n\n\u201cNobody ever knew they were there, and so of course nobody ever\ntried to get them out. But _I_ knew they were there\u2014 that\u2019s the\n_Oats Theory of the Rationality of Light_. And I have got them out!\u201d\nHis voice rose in triumph. \u201cThat\u2019s the Light Machine\u2014the greatest\ninvention in the history of the world!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, the Light Machine,\u201d said Tubby, when the professor paused.\n\n\u201cThe Oats Light Machine\u2014here it is\u2014the only one in the world. I\u2019ll\nshow you at once.\u201d\n\nHe switched off the lights. The room was quite dark except for a\nlittle beam of white light that seemed to thread its way through the\nintricate system of mirrors and prisms of the Light Machine. Tubby\ncould not see where this light came from or where it went to. But he\nsaw distinctly that it turned several corners and was alternately\nbroad and narrow. It was white throughout most of its course; but in\none short span it was a dark, angry red, and in another a deep,\nbeautiful purple.\n\n\u201cThe Light Machine,\u201d the Professor began; his fingers caressed one\nof its little reflectors lovingly, \u201cis able to extract from light\nall the images it holds, no matter how long they have been there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, ain\u2019t it?\u201d said Tubby with admiration.\n\n\u201cYes. Let me show you. Here is the telescope. I train it on a star\u2014a\nstar, mark you, that is not a sun, but that shines by reflected\nlight. This beam of starlight, contains moonlight, earthlight,\nsunlight (_our_ sunlight, you know)\u2014and the light from millions of\nother suns. The starlight comes out from here\u201d\u2014he touched the lower\nend of the telescope.\n\n\u201cNow you see this ray of my own created light passes directly in\nfront of where the starlight comes out\u2014that\u2019s where they mix.\u201d\n\nTubby saw the little beam of white light crossed at right angles to\nthe telescope eyepiece and passed very close to it.\n\n\u201cThis light of my own is created by burning zonogen\u2014a gas I\ndiscovered myself.\n\n\u201cFrom this point, where the starlight joins it, my ray goes to the\nspectroscope\u201d\u2014he touched another portion of the Light Machine\u2014\u201cand\nit is polarized here. These\u201d\u2014he indicated a long row of tiny black\ncompartments; Tubby could see the beam of light entering at one end\nand emerging at the other\u2014\u201cthese are my image extractors. Each takes\nfrom the light some of its images\u2014leaving finally only the\nearthlight and the images that belong to it.\n\n\u201cThere are many other processes\u2014_some_ day you will understand them\nall. But for now\u2014let me show you the result.\n\n\u201cThe pure earthlight passes last of all into my projector. See it\nhere?\u201d He laid his hand on what looked to Tubby something like a\nmagic lantern.\n\n\u201cMy operating power is electricity.\u201d He turned a switch. Tubby first\nheard a low hum and then a whirring, clicking sound.\n\n\u201cThis projector magnifies the image\u2014throws it up on a screen.\u201d He\npointed to the wall; Tubby saw a small square of canvas hung on the\nwall.\n\n\u201cNow then,\u201d the professor continued, his voice trembling with\nemotion, \u201cthat star my telescope is pointing at is now exactly nine\nhundred and twenty-seven and one half Light-years away. That means\nthat eighteen hundred and fifty-five years ago to-night the light we\nare getting back now from that star left the earth. Do you know what\nwas happening eighteen hundred and fifty-five years ago to-night?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tubby. \u201cYes. Lots of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can pick anything I want from the light,\u201d the professor answered.\n\u201cI merely tune my instruments differently. Like wireless, you\nknow\u2014it\u2019s all a matter of vibration. I have picked the most\nimportant thing that was happening\u2014the \u2018Burning of Rome\u2019!\u201d\n\nHe turned another switch; the clicking sound grew louder. On the\nsheet, Tubby saw a great city in flames. He seemed to be standing on\na hill, looking down at it. In the foreground he saw the young Roman\nEmperor, with his mistress, his friends and his music, as they\nreclined at ease, watching the destruction. Tubby stared for a long\ntime, fascinated.\n\n\u201cYou are looking into the past,\u201d he heard the professor\u2019s droning\nvoice saying.\n\n\u201cAll that has been stored up in the light all these years. It is\nlight itself\u2014the work of God, not of man.\n\n\u201cThat is Nero sitting there. No one living to-day on this earth has\never seen him before. But there he is\u2014Nero the Cruel, Emperor of\nRome. _We_ see him, you and I, for we are looking into the\npast\u2014looking into the past.\u201d The professor\u2019s voice trailed off into\nsilence.\n\nTubby stared breathlessly. His heart was beating fast; he was\ntrembling all over. He felt suddenly a little faint. He was in a\ncold sweat, and he sat down abruptly in a little wooden chair beside\nthe Light Machine.\n\nThe scene before him was very vivid; he could almost hear the\nEmperor\u2019s music. Why, he _did_ hear music! Funny! The professor had\nnot mentioned that.\n\nThe clicking noise grew louder; the scene before him was so bright\nhe could see nothing else around. It was very dark, and very close\nand stuffy. Where was the professor? Why didn\u2019t he say something\nabout the music?\n\nTubby grew a little frightened. He shifted his feet uneasily. The\nlittle chair in which he was sitting was very uncomfortable. It\ncramped him; his back hurt. After a little while the scene before\nhim slowly faded. The lights in the room flashed on; a rustling, and\na shuffling of many feet sounded in his ears.\n\nTubby sat up abruptly, blinking in the sudden light.\n\n\u201cSome kid, that Nero\u2014eh, Jake?\u201d said a voice beside him.\n\n\u201cYou said it. Some picture. Come on, Tubby, let\u2019s go home,\u201d said the\nfirst man.",
