    "body": "Every paper said so in all the languages there were, I guess. I kept\nreading them, but didn't know what to believe. I know what I wanted to\nthink, but that's different from actually knowing.\n\nThere was the usual news just after Labor Day. The Dodgers were winning\nor losing, I forget which, and UCLA was strong and was going to beat\neverybody they met that fall. An H-bomb had been tested in the\nPacific, blowing another island off the map, just as if we had islands\nto spare. Ordinarily this was important, but now it wasn't. They put\nstuff like this in the back pages and hardly anybody reads it. There\nwas only one thing on the front pages and it was all people talked\nabout. All I talked about, anyway.\n\nIt began long before. I don't know how long because they didn't print\nthat. But it began and there it was, right upon us that day. It\nwas Saturday. Big things always seem to happen on Saturdays. I ate\nbreakfast and got out early. I had the usual things to do, mowing the\nlawn, for instance. I didn't do it nor anything else and nobody said\nanything. There wasn't any use in mowing the lawn on a day like that.\n\nI went out, remembering not to slam the door. It wasn't much, but it\nshowed thoughtfulness. I went past the church and looked at the sign\nthat was set diagonally at the corner so that it could be read from\nboth streets. There it was in big letters, quoting from the papers:\nTHIS IS THE DAY THE WORLD ENDS! Some smart reporter had thought it up\nand it seemed so true that that was the only way it was ever said. Me?\nI didn't know.\n\n\n\nIt was a bright day. People were out walking or just standing and\nlooking at the sky. It was too early to look up. I went on. Paul\nEberhard was sitting on the lawn when I came along. He tossed me the\nfootball and I caught it and tried to spin it on my finger. It didn't\nspin. It fell and flopped out with crazy bounces into the street.\nThe milk truck stopped, while I got it out of the way. I tossed the\nfootball back to Paul. He put his hand on it and sat there.\n\n\"What'll we do?\" he said.\n\nI made a motion with my hands. \"We can throw the ball around,\" I said.\n\n\"Naw,\" he said. \"Maybe you've got some comic books.\"\n\n\"You've seen them all,\" I said. \"You got some?\"\n\n\"I gave them to Howie,\" he said, thoughtfully screwing the point of the\nball into the center of a dandelion. \"He said he was going to get some\nnew ones though. Let's go see.\" He got up and tossed the ball toward\nthe porch. It hit the railing and bounced back into the bushes. That's\nwhere he usually kept it.\n\n\"Paul,\" called his mother as we started out.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Don't go far. I've got some things I want you to do.\"\n\n\"What?\" he said patiently.\n\n\"Hauling trash out of the basement. Helping me move some of the potted\nplants around in front.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"I'll be back.\"\n\nWe went past another church on the way to Howie's. The sign was the\nsame there. THIS IS THE DAY THE WORLD ENDS! They never said more than\nthat. They wanted it to hang in our minds, something we couldn't quite\ntouch, but we knew was there.\n\nPaul jerked his head at the sign. \"What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" I broke off a twig as we passed a tree. \"What about\nyou?\"\n\n\"We got it coming.\" He looked at the sky.\n\n\"Yeah, but will we get it?\"\n\nHe didn't answer that. \"I wonder if it will be bright?\"\n\n\"It is now.\"\n\n\"It might cloud over.\"\n\n\"It won't matter. It'll split the sky.\" That was one thing sure. Clouds\nor anything weren't going to stand in the way.\n\nWe went on and found Howie. Howie is a Negro, smaller than we are and\ntwice as fast. He can throw a football farther and straighter than\nanyone else on the team. We pal around quite a bit, especially in the\nfootball season.\n\nHe came out of the house like he was walking on whipped cream. I didn't\nlet that fool me. More than once I've tried to tackle him during a\npractice game. Howie was carrying a model of a rocket ship, CO_{2}\npowered. It didn't work. We said hi all around and then he suggested a\ngame of keep-away. We'd left the football at Paul's and we couldn't so\nwe walked over to the park.\n\n\n\nWe sat down and began talking about it. \"I'm wondering if it will\nreally come,\" said Paul. We all squinted up.\n\n\"Where'll the President watch it from?\" I said. \"He should have a good\nview from the White House.\"\n\n\"No better than us right here,\" said Howie.\n\n\"What about Australia? Will they see it there?\" I said.\n\n\"They'll see it all over.\"\n\n\"Africa, too? And what about the Eskimos?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether they actually see it or not. It will come to\neveryone at the same time.\"\n\nI didn't see how it could, but I didn't feel like an argument. That's\nwhat they were saying on TV and you can't talk back to that.\n\n\"Everybody,\" said Howie. \"Not just in this town, but all over. Wherever\nthere are people. Even where they're not.\"\n\n\"You read that,\" said Paul.\n\n\"Sure,\" said Howie. \"You lent me the comic books. It's even in them.\"\n\nWe didn't say much after that. I kept thinking of the man who made\nthe H-bomb. I bet he felt silly and spiteful, blowing up an island.\nSomebody might have wanted to live on it, if he'd just left it there.\nHe must have felt mean and low when something really big like this came\nalong.\n\nWe talked on for a while, but we'd talked it out long ago. There was\nreally nothing new we could say. Every so often we'd look up at the\nsky, but it wasn't going to come until it got here.\n\nFinally we drifted apart. There wasn't anything left to do. We walked\nhome with Howie and then I went with Paul, leaving him to come back to\nmy house. I looked at the lawn and without thinking about it got busy\nand mowed it. I surprised myself.\n\nIt was hot, or it seemed to me it was. I went in to eat. Ma came by and\nshut off the sound of TV. I could still see the picture in the other\nroom. The announcer was making faces, but, of course, I didn't hear\nwhat he said. He looked pretty funny, I thought. I thought we were all\nprobably pretty funny, moving our mouths and blinking our eyes and\nwaving our hands. Only nothing real was coming out. Not yet, anyway.\n\n\"Sit still,\" said Ma. \"It will happen without your help. It's going to\nbe all right.\"\n\n\"Think so?\" I said. She would have told me anything to keep me quiet.\nShe gets nervous when I fidget.\n\n\"I think so,\" she said, giving me my allowance. It was early for that.\nUsually I didn't get it until after supper. \"Why don't you run uptown\nand watch it from there?\"\n\n\"Maybe I will,\" I said, dabbling my hands in the water at the sink.\n\"Are you going to go?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm not. Why should I get into that mob? I can watch it just\nas well from here.\"\n\nSure she could. But it was not the same. Everybody I knew was going\nto be there. I changed shirts before I left. I took a rag and wiped\nthe dust from my shoes. I wasn't trying to be fussy or dressed up or\nanything. I just thought I should do it.\n\n\n\nThere was shade and sun on the streets and a few big clouds in the sky.\n\nA car slowed up and stopped beside me. The window rolled down and Jack\nGoodwin leaned toward me. \"Going uptown?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Want a lift?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Actually I didn't. I'd rather have walked, looking around as I\nwent.\n\nJack Goodwin grinned as I got in. He's got gray hair, where he has\nhair. The rest is bald. He looked me over. \"I don't see any comets on\nyour shoulders,\" he said gravely.\n\n\"I never had any,\" I said. Some people seem to think everyone under\nseventeen is a kid.\n\n\"You'll be needing them,\" he said.\n\n\"Maybe,\" I said. I ought to have walked.\n\nI never knew how slow a day could pass. I suppose I should have slept\nlate and kept busy doing something. This was worse than putting on a\nuniform and waiting until gametime. At least there was a coach on the\nfield to tell you what to do as you ran through the drill.\n\nJack Goodwin stopped at a light. I had a notion to get out. But I\ndidn't. Goodwin grinned again as the light changed and we started up.\n\"I don't blame you for being edgy,\" he said. \"It's the suspense. If we\nonly had some way of knowing for sure, radio maybe.\"\n\n\"There's no radio,\" I said. \"The calculations have been checked.\"\n\n\"Sure, but maybe there's something we forgot. Or don't know. All sorts\nof things can go wrong.\"\n\nHe must have talked on and on, but I didn't listen. Howie and me and\nPaul had gone over everything he was saying.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said as he stopped and I got out.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" he said. He nearly scraped the rear fender of the\ncar as he drove off. It was a new car, too. He wasn't so bad. Maybe he\nwas just worried.\n\nI wandered to the newsstand and looked at magazines and pocketbooks.\nOld lady Simpson didn't ask me if I was going to buy and didn't chase\nme away. She was busy arguing with some customers. Even so it was the\nfirst time she didn't pay attention to me when I came in. I had a\ngood chance to look at things I never buy. There was nothing in them\nI wanted to see. I was thirsty. I had a coke and was still thirsty. I\nasked for a glass of water, drank half of it and went out.\n\n\n\nDown the street there was a TV set in a store window. I watched it.\nThey were showing a street in India, people looking up. They flashed\nall around, to Italy, China, Brazil. Except for their clothes, it\nwasn't much different from here. They were all looking up.\n\nI did the same. For the first time I noticed there was a slight\novercast. Big billowing clouds had passed, but this was worse. I hoped\nit would clear away in time. Not that it really mattered.\n\nIt was more crowded than usual for Saturday, but at the same time it\nwas quiet. People were shopping, but they weren't really buying much or\nelse they bought it faster. Nobody wanted to miss it. They all seemed\nto have one eye on their lists and another on the clock.\n\nHowie and Paul came up the street and we nodded and said something. A\nfew other boys from the school passed by and we stopped. We gathered\ntogether. It was getting closer--and the space between the minutes was\ngrowing longer and longer.\n\nI looked at Paul's watch. He said it was on the minute. I decided there\nwas time to go in and get a candy bar. All of a sudden I was hungry. I\ndidn't know where it came from. I'd had to stuff down lunch not long\nago. And now I was hungry.\n\nI went to a store and had to fight my way in. People were coming out.\nNot just customers, but the clerks and owner, too. There was a big\ntelevision screen inside, but nobody wanted to see it on that. They\nwanted to be outside where it would happen to them. Not just see it,\nhave it happen. The store was empty. Not closed--empty.\n\nI turned and rushed out to join the others. I couldn't miss it.\nThere were still minutes to go, but suppose there _had_ been a\nmiscalculation. I knew what that would mean, but even so I had to be\nthere. I would almost die, too.\n\nNow we were all looking up--all over the world people were, I suppose.\nIt was quiet. You could hear them breathing.\n\nAnd then it came, a flash across the sky, a silver streak, the biggest\nvapor trail there ever was. It went from this side to that side in no\ntime. It split the sky and was gone before the shock blast hit us.\nNobody said anything. We stood there and shivered and straightened up\nafter the rumbling sound passed.\n\nBut there was the vapor trail that stretched farther than anyone could\nsee. It would go around the world at least once before it came to an\nend somewhere in the desert. I saw my science teacher--he was trying to\nsmile, but couldn't. And then there was the pharmacist who had wanted\nto be a research chemist, but wasn't good enough.\n\nIn front of me, old Fred Butler who drives the bus to Orange Point and\nKing City cracked his knuckles. \"He did it,\" he whispered. \"All the way\nto Mars and back. Safe and right on schedule.\" He jumped up in the air\nand kept jumping up. He hadn't been that high off the ground in several\nyears. He never would be again unless he took an elevator. And I knew\nhe hated elevators.\n\nFactory whistles started blowing. They sounded louder than Gabriel.\nI wonder if he heard them. I grabbed hold of the nearest person and\nstarted hugging. I didn't know it was the snooty girl from the next\nblock until she hugged back and began kissing me. We yelled louder than\nthe factory whistles. We had a right.\n\nIt was just like the papers said: This was the day the world ended--\n\nAnd the Universe began.\n\n\n\n\n",
