    "body": "Snow and ice on that mountain. Nothing but snow. The wind drove it\nwith a howl against the windows, where it stuck on the warm panes.\nSometimes I could just make out the blur of the semaphore lights and\nsometimes I couldn\u2019t. All day the blizzard had dumped its swirling\nload about us, and now, when night closed down, the storm took the\ntower in its teeth, shaking it like you\u2019ve seen a dog shake a rat.\n\nOh, we were warm and cozy enough with our stove red hot. Which was\nmore than Donaldson, the agent at Hastings, could say. His wire talk\nwas rotten, chattery, and he told us he\u2019d run out of coal. Looked like\nhe\u2019d freeze to death, according to him. But Big Ben prophesied grimly\nthat Donaldson could take care of himself, so we might as well save\nour worries.\n\nI don\u2019t suppose you ever heard of Big Ben, but that is your loss.\nEvery soul on the Mountain Division knew him. His Morse snapped out\nlike a track torpedo, fast, too, but accurate, staccato, with a smooth\nflow as if a machine had hold of the key. Dots and dashes were part of\nhim, for, after years of it, he could express himself better that way.\n\nSort of feeling for the language, I suppose. I\u2019ve seen the same gift\nsince, but never to the extent Ben possessed it. Why, he could come\nmighty close to telling the color of your eyes over a telegraph-wire.\n\nHe and I had worked tower BB-17 on the Mountain Division for three\nyears, and during that time I never saw him flurried. Once a freight,\nrunning extra, got by us\u2014dispatcher tangled up his train-sheet. Forty\nminutes later a relay came into stop her or she\u2019d meet 87 on the big\ngrade.\n\nIt takes just forty minutes to run from our tower to Hastings, further\ndown the line. Hastings is the last station with a siding before the\ngrade. In other words, the freight ought to have been getting her O.\nK. from Hastings right then.\n\nWas Ben excited? Not one little bit.\n\nDonaldson caught his first call. Clear as a bell it was. And Donaldson\nhad time to flag the freight.\n\nBut the particular night I\u2019m speaking of, my side partner appeared a\nbit uneasy, which was enough to set my think-tank working. He\u2019d drop\ndown alongside the key for a moment; then he\u2019d wander over to the\nwindows, trying to pierce the blizzard.\n\nHe was a big man with a hearty laugh and a mouth full of teeth and a\nwhiskered chin full of determination. His red hair, as brilliant as\nthe glow in his corn-cob pipe, usually stood on end. But his eyes were\ngray and pleasant; that is, generally they were. Yet I\u2019ve noticed \u2019em\nhard as rocks, drilling into you with a gleam in \u2019em like you see\njumping across a spark-gap. Right now they were anxious.\n\nPerhaps that wasn\u2019t so strange, either, for all day long, from the\nlength of the division, had come bunches of trouble. A snowshed out\nhere; a freight ditched there; hell to pay everywhere.\n\nWires were down, too. Not a word could we get below Hastings or north\nof the junction. Toward night every siding was overflowing with\ndeadheaded rolling stock. You see, the big grade\u2014it\u2019s four and a half\nper cent in places\u2014handicaps us because even our best oil-burners\nwon\u2019t haul much tonnage on it in a blizzard. They can\u2019t make steam.\n\nAnd this particular frolic of the elements promised to beat anything\nthat had struck us in twenty years. At 10 P.M. the chief dispatcher\nordered the line cleared for the night, barring No. 77 southbound,\nwhich was to make her run as usual. I reckon you\u2019ve heard of that\ntrain\u2014the Cumberland Limited, all steel and solid Pullman? She was to\nfollow a snow-plow, and headquarters gossip filtering to us hinted she\nmight find the blizzard a bit of a teaser.\n\nSuddenly Big Ben turned on me. \u201cJim,\u201d said he, \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\nWhat\u2019s the old man thinking of to let 77 through? Have you heard what\nshe\u2019s carrying to-night?\u201d\n\nI allowed I hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s something like one hundred thousand in gold in her\nexpress-car. Government consignment. I got it straight. What a chance\nfor a hold-up! Remember that cut below Hastings?\u201d He shook his massive\nhead dubiously. \u201cIt\u2019s been done before.\u201d\n\nAs if to emphasize his words, the storm swooped down with renewed\nenergy until the tower swayed like a lighthouse. Great guns! how the\nwind shrieked at us. How the snow thudded against the windows. And\nwhen you _hear_ snow, you know there\u2019s a double-headed gale behind it.\n\nAbout that time our call came over the wire: \u201cN-H, N-H, N-H.\u201d\n\nAs Ben jumped in, I put down my paper to listen. I find it\u2019s a good\nthing to pay pretty strict attention to anything on a night like that.\nIt keeps you from seeing shadows that aren\u2019t there, and hearing sounds\nwhich your common sense tells you must be the wind.\n\nPresently came the professional dot and dash of Donaldson down at\nHastings. Now Donaldson, next to Big Ben, was a star operator, and the\ntwo of \u2019em could talk better and with more satisfaction over a stretch\nof singing wire than if they were sitting together in a parlor.\n\nEven _I_ knew Donaldson\u2019s style, although I wasn\u2019t more than middling\nexpert. There were tricks in his stuff such as shortening his o\u2019s, but\nhis Morse ran mighty smooth. I read off the message to myself.\n\n\u201cFreezing cold down here, Ben. Lonely, too. Damn lonely. What do you\nget on 77?\u201d\n\nThe big man at the table cut in: \u201cBrace up; 77 on time. Nothing to\nbother her to-night except the storm. All freight deadheaded.\u201d\n\nThat seemed to satisfy Donaldson, for there was a long silence broken\nonly by the whine of the wind and the _thud_, _thud_ of driven snow. I\nhad just picked up the paper again when \u201cN-H, N-H, N-H,\u201d snapped at\nus.\n\nThe crispness of dots and dashes suggested excitement. Ben\nacknowledged deliberately, but when he closed the wire I saw a\nnarrowing of his eyes.\n\nDonaldson was in a hurry. \u201cGoing to quit to-morrow,\u201d he began. \u201cCan\u2019t\nstand this joint. Say, there\u2019s two of you up there. You\u2019re lucky. Old\nman will have to come across with an assistant or I quit. Do you know\nyou\u2019re the nearest white man to me? Just me alone here. No night for a\nman to be alone. Hold on, I think I hear somebody in the waiting-room.\nMaybe I\u2019ll have company.\u201d\n\nBut he opened up again the next moment with: \u201cGood Lord, must be going\noff my nut. Nobody in the waiting-room. It\u2019s the wind. I tell you this\nplace is like the north pole. If I could only hear a fire crackling.\nSay, there it goes again. No, I\u2019m way off; that\u2019s a fact. I\u2019ll have to\nlook around. Do you notice anything funny in the wind? I seem to. Why\nthe devil didn\u2019t they put shades on these windows? What\u2019s the matter\nwith me anyhow?\u201d\n\nBen went back at him, calm as a summer\u2019s day. \u201cHold on, old man; take\nsome whisky. It\u2019s your nerves. Get a grip on yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d answered Donaldson, his wire-talk becoming calmer. \u201cYes,\nI\u2019ll take the whisky. Let me know about 77.\u201d\n\nThat was all for a while, but Ben eyed me through the fumes of his\npipe. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNot a bit. Never knew Donaldson\nto wildcat before. Wonder if there _is_ anything wrong?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t say what was on my mind, for the shriek of the storm\ninterrupted. So we just sat still and looked at each other and\nwondered what it would be like if either of _us_ weren\u2019t there.\n\nSomehow I couldn\u2019t get rid of the picture of Hastings station\u2014a little\nframe building backed up against a cliff, with a siding cutting in\nbehind it and the banked curve of the main line stretching away before\nit. A few farmers used the station, but a water-tank was its real\nexcuse for existence.\n\nI could see how the snow had half-buried it, and how Donaldson,\nveteran that he was, might hear strange sounds in the gale. I could\nsee a great many things right then, but the sight wasn\u2019t pleasant.\n\nSnow, snow and more snow, and icy rails and low, hurrying clouds you\nfelt were brushing against the tower. \u201cListen!\u201d I snapped.\n\nBen jumped to his feet. \u201cThis won\u2019t do. Here, you quit listening or\nyou\u2019ll be as bad as Donaldson.\u201d Then he came over to me. \u201cI guess it\u2019s\njust as well there\u2019re two of us,\u201d he said very quietly. \u201cTry the\njunction for a report on 77.\u201d\n\nI took the key with a sense of awe\u2014only a couple of slim wires between\nus and the world, and a thousand chances for the storm to tear \u2019em\ndown. But if we felt it, what about Donaldson? What about Donaldson,\nanyway?\n\nThe junction answered after a bit, though there was no life in the\nsending. \u201cMcFlin,\u201d nodded Ben. \u201cI know his style. Ask him whether the\norders for 77 stand.\u201d\n\nI did.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d clicked McFlin; \u201c77 on time. Pass her through. Rotten night,\nisn\u2019t it? They got a plow leading the limited like a blind baby.\nSo-long.\u201d\n\nThat was at eleven two. Twenty minutes later Donaldson started after\nus again, but it was a chattering, wild Donaldson; a new Donaldson who\ntumbled his letters over each other.\n\n\u201cN-H, N-H, N-H,\u201d he stuttered, even after I had opened the wire. \u201cN-H,\nN-H.\u201d\n\nI sent him a string of Rs a mile long before he acknowledged. Then:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you up there?\u201d he clicked. \u201cGone to sleep? But\nyou can\u2019t sleep now; you\u2019ve got to talk to me or I\u2019ll be ready for the\nqueer house. Something is walking up and down outside my window. I\u2019ve\nseen it twice. It can\u2019t be a man, and animals don\u2019t prowl about in a\nstorm like this. Listen to that wind. I tell you it\u2019s walking around\nthe station. What am I saying? Do you believe in ghosts? It was in the\nwaiting-room a while back, but it got out before I had a shot at it.\nWhat would you do if you were down here alone, snowed in like a damned\nEskimo? What would you do if it started to walk\u2014\u201d\n\nBig Ben strode across the room. \u201cGive me the key,\u201d he thundered. His\neyes were hard gray now, like rock, with little points of fire in\nthem, and it seemed he would smash the instrument as he crashed down\nwith Donaldson\u2019s call.\n\n\u201cStop that!\u201d went the dots and dashes, clear cut, fast, but Lordy,\nthey had a punch behind \u2019em. \u201cPull yourself together. Take some more\nwhisky. Wake up. Remember you\u2019re an operator. You\u2019ve got to handle the\nLimited to-night. No more of that. You know damn well nothing is\nwalking around down there except you. Rub some snow in your face. Wake\nup, I say. I\u2019ll talk to you as much as you like, but no more spook\nstuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d came the slower response. \u201cI won\u2019t bother you any\nmore. Nevertheless, it\u2019s walking around here. Maybe I\u2019ll get a shot at\nit. I\u2019ll let you know if I do.\u201d\n\nThat was all, and Ben and I looked across the table into each other\u2019s\neyes. \u201cWell?\u201d I questioned.\n\nHe shook himself as if trying to get rid of something clinging. \u201cOh,\nDonaldson is getting old,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s lonely down there, and\nhis fire\u2019s out. That\u2019s what I make of it.\n\n\u201cWhen the wind howls, and you\u2019re on a night shift in a God-forsaken\nspot like Hastings, you\u2019re mighty apt to hear and see a little more\n\u2019an you\u2019ve any business to.\u201d\n\nThe next word that came flashing over the wire left no doubt in our\nminds. Either Donaldson was clean crazy or\u2014well, he _must_ be crazy!\n\n\u201cEver see a face half black and half white?\u201d stuttered our instrument.\n\u201cI had a shot at it. It\u2019s still walking.\u201d\n\nBen waited an instant then sent \u201cJ-J,\u201d Donaldson\u2019s call, steady for\nthree minutes. But he might as well have opened the window and yelled\nout into the storm. The wire was either dead or Hastings wouldn\u2019t\nanswer.\n\nPresently McFlin at the junction got busy. \u201cJust O. K.\u2019d 77,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDevilish night. The Limited looked like a hunk of the mountain on\nwheels. Bet the snow on the car-roofs gets scraped off on the top of\nthe tunnels. Happy dreams.\u201d\n\nBut we weren\u2019t to indulge in any happy dreams for some time to come.\nHardly had McFlin shut up when \u201cN-H, N-H, N-H\u201d called Ben back.\n\u201cLord,\u201d he groaned, \u201chear that style? It\u2019s Donaldson, but what\u2019s\nhappened to him? I hate to listen to it.\u201d\n\nDull, lifeless, flat, came the dots and dashes from Hastings. \u201cNo\nuse,\u201d clicked Donaldson. \u201cThis hide-and-seek is beyond me. Its face is\nhalf black and half white, and bullets don\u2019t worry it. I\u2019m a gone\nduck. Never mind me. Anyhow, hell is warm and not as lonesome as this.\nI\u2019m freezing, and that\u2019s no ghost story.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d Ben\u2019s reply flew forth, \u201ccan that stuff. Pull\nyourself together, old man. Forget the face or whatever it is; 77\u2019s on\ntime. Hold hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d agreed Donaldson wearily, \u201cI\u2019ll handle the Limited. How\u2019s the\nstorm up there?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuitting,\u201d lied Ben, and went to the window.\n\nThen followed an hour of silence, with only the shriek of the wind and\nthe thud of snow. I reckon the two of us smoked considerable tobacco\nduring that hour, and we played a few games of checkers, too, but our\nminds wandered.\n\nWhen at last we heard the shrill squeal of 77\u2019s whistle above the\nnoise of the blizzard, we felt happy. Just to know there were other\npeople near us\u2014believe me, that was some relief!\n\nFar off up the line we could make out the headlight of the Limited\nlike a blinking, misty moon creeping toward us. Ben glanced at his\nsemaphore levers. Down she bore on us, the din of her drivers muffled\nby snow.\n\nThere was the thunder of moving tons, a blast of cinders against the\ntower windows, and a snaky line of black as the Pullmans flashed past\nunder their white-caps. We watched her red tail-lights around the\ncurve.\n\n\u201cJ-J, J-J, J-J,\u201d clicked Ben, back at the table. And directly Hastings\nanswered in the same lifeless style.\n\n\u201cLimited just passed O. K.,\u201d went on my side partner. \u201cHow are you\nfeeling?\u201d\n\nDonaldson\u2019s wire-talk was worse than ever. \u201cFine,\u201d he stuttered.\n\u201cMaybe I can hold out. The damn thing\u2019s always near me. It\u2019s cold\nhere. I\u2019ve got my feet on the stove. Say, this stove is a joke. It\u2019s\nso empty it\u2019s going to cave in pretty soon. Wait a minute, let me try\nanother shot.\u201d\n\nNothing more. Not another word, though we took turns at the key. And\nwhen Ben relighted his pipe I didn\u2019t like the look on his face. \u201cJim,\u201d\nhe began, \u201cthere\u2019s things in this world none of us can understand. I\nreckon after all that maybe, I misjudged Donaldson; perhaps he\u2019s up\nagainst one of \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuit!\u201d I bellowed. \u201cYou watch yourself or you\u2019ll be splitting a\nswitch, too. As you said a while back, Donaldson\u2019s nervous and cold.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s the matter with him; nothing else.\u201d\n\nBen, mumbling a reply, turned again to the window. If possible the\nstorm was worse.\n\nI don\u2019t exactly remember how it happened; I must have dozed off about\nthen, being pretty tuckered out. Anyhow, the first thing I knew Ben\nwas shaking the life out of me. I\u2019ll never forget the expression of\nhis face as I opened my eyes.\n\nHis eyes were all red, his hands were working, his jaw set. \u201cWake up,\nJim,\u201d he hissed. \u201cI heard it, too.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he went on as I instinctively looked toward the window. \u201cNot\nthere; over the wire. Listen!\u201d\n\nI listened, but for a long time nothing broke the vibrating stillness\nof the tower. And I got to thinking it was another case of nerves.\nThen, Father above us! may I never again hear such a sound!\n\nOur instrument started to whisper. You laugh, do you? But if you\u2019d\nbeen there you wouldn\u2019t have laughed. We went over to the table on\ntiptoe, hardly daring to breathe. The little steel bar trembled; moved\ndown; snapped back, barely closing the contact.\n\nIt was like a dying man framing words he couldn\u2019t utter. I followed in\nmy mind the course of the single, drumming wire over the trestles,\nthrough the ravines, under the mountains. What manner of thing was\npressing the key at the other end?\n\nBen dropped forward with an oath and pillowed his elbows on the table\nas if his nearness might aid him. \u201cListen!\u201d he begged. \u201cOh, Jim,\n_listen_!\u201d\n\nPresently the instrument quivered again, but this time the impulse was\nstronger. Horribly flaccid, monotonously regular, like the labored\neffort of an amateur, came the message which shall forever sear my\nmemory with unspeakable horror.\n\n\u201cGod\u2014in\u2014heaven\u2014help me. I\u2014can\u2019t\u2014stand\u2014this. They\u2014chained\u2014cross\u2014\nties\u2014to\u2014the\u2014rails. They\u2014will\u2014ditch\u2014the\u2014Limited. I\u2019m\u2014done\u2014for.\nHell\u2014is\u2014nearer\u2014now. Help. Dear\u2014God\u2014help\u2014me\u2014\u201d\n\nThat was all. Ben tore at the key, sending out into the night, \u201cJ-J,\nJ-J, J-J,\u201d until my head swam.\n\nBut no response came; not the least flutter. Only agonizing, storm\nshrieking silence.\n\nThen he gave it up and staggered to his feet. His face was as gray as\nslate. \u201cJim,\u201d he gasped, \u201cDonaldson is dead! I know it. It was a dying\nman who sent that message.\u201d\n\nI grabbed him by the shoulders. \u201cYou fool!\u201d I yelled. \u201cHe can\u2019t be\ndead\u2014he sent it. Don\u2019t you understand? They\u2019re going to wreck the\nLimited. Donaldson was telling us. He _may_ be wounded. We\u2019ve got to\nget to him.\u201d\n\nSlowly, as if his body was awakening from sleep, the muscles in his\nshoulders under my hand tightened. \u201cSure, I get you,\u201d he whispered.\nAnd before I knew what he was doing, he shook me off, rushing blindly\nfor the stairs. \u201cCome on, Jim. For God\u2019s sake, hurry!\u201d he called.\n\u201cBring my gun and some torpedoes. It\u2019s only five miles by the road;\nthirty down the mountain by the track. Let\u2019s try the car\u2014\u201d\n\nI stopped long enough to be sure the revolver we kept in a drawer was\nloaded, stuffed some torpedoes in my pocket, and followed him. Out\ninto the gale he sped to where he kept his little second-hand,\nmud-spattered gas-wagon. I had always kidded him about it, laughed at\nit; but now I prayed.\n\nYes, funny when you think of it, me praying! But I did\u2014prayed it would\nrun; prayed there was gas and oil in it.\n\nOnce away from the lee of the building, the storm wrapped around us,\nflinging the snow in our faces, making us gasp for breath. We were\ntaking desperate chances and breaking all rules\u2014this leaving a tower\nvacant, but what could we do? What in God\u2019s name could we do?\n\nWhen I caught up with Ben he was cranking the engine desperately. I\npropped the shanty door open, though the blast of wind threatened to\nfairly tear it from its hinges.\n\nFortunately the radiator of the car had antifreezing mixture in it.\nAfter an agonizing moment, the engine gave a couple of disgusted\ncoughs and died. But Ben went right on. He spun that thing till I was\ndizzy as I sat with my hand on the throttle, feeding it raw gas.\n\nWhen there seemed no chance left, and I could see the Limited a\nburning, blackened mass, and hear the cries of the injured, the engine\nstarted, missing like thunder, to be sure. Ben leaped in beside me and\nlet in his clutch.\n\nOnce beyond the shanty our headlights ended in a whirling bank of\nsnow, and the cold stabbed like a driven nail. But the engine was\nrunning better now.\n\nHow my side partner found the road, or how he kept that rickety piece\nof junk from chucking us down a ravine I\u2019ll never know. But he did.\nYes, by the grace of the Lord, he did.\n\nPitching like a ship in a storm, sinking now and then up to our hubs,\nwe jounced on down that mountain. What everlasting miles of emptiness!\nWhat biting pain as our ears and hands and noses turned red, then\nwhite.\n\nOnce we heard the shriek of the Limited below us on the grade; once we\nsaw the flash of her furnace door. Seconds turned into minutes;\nminutes into hours. Would we be in time? I set my teeth and prayed\nsome more.\n\nAh, we had hit the last stretch and through the smother we could see\nthe semaphore lights of Hastings station. Also the light in the\nbuilding itself. Our car snorted and groaned as Ben fed it the gas,\nskidding to the edge of a precipice or flinging us half out of our\nseats, but we never thought of that.\n\nAnd now came the wail of the Limited\u2019s whistle, this time above us.\nHer headlight flickered across the cut, touching the station with\nuncertain fingers. The semaphore was set green.\n\nI shivered, but not from cold. If only we had half a chance, but the\neverlasting snow\u2014how it clung to our wheels! And under it our\ntire-chains spun gratingly in red clay which flecked the white of the\nroad like blood.\n\nBearing down on Hastings station, gathering speed with each pound of\nher drivers, thundered the Limited. We were playing the passage of a\nminute against a pile of cross-ties\u2014and the forfeit was death!\n\nNow we reached the nearest point to the right-of-way, and as we jerked\nto a halt, a black figure appeared on the depot platform against the\nlight. I saw the flash of a gun and heard a bullet sing past.\n\nBut Ben paid no heed. Throwing himself from the car, he floundered\nover to the track. I ran toward the station, firing as I went. Once I\nlooked back. Ben was kneeling down, adjusting torpedoes under the very\npilot of the plow.\n\nNow there isn\u2019t any use of my explaining how the Limited roared by,\nher engineer satisfied with the green of the semaphore; nor how he\ngave her the air when the torpedoes warned him.\n\nNor, for that matter, of the futile pursuit of the bandits who had\nintended to ditch her. All that came out in the morning paper. If I\nremember, there was even a picture of the pile of cross-ties chained\nto the track.\n\nThe fact that will interest you is what we discovered in Hastings\nstation. Without bothering to explain to 77\u2019s wondering crew, we\ndashed into the waiting-room and threw open the door of the ticket\noffice.\n\nAt the table sat Donaldson. He was stiff and rigid, and from an ugly\nblotched hole in his neck there crept a frozen stream of blood. His\nright hand still rested on the telegraph-key.\n\n\u201cGood God!\u201d I muttered. \u201cDead! He never moved after he was shot.\u201d\n\nAnd then, somehow feeling Ben\u2019s eyes upon me, I looked at him. His\nsmile was ghastly.\n\n\u201cSure?\u201d he said. \u201cI told you so back in the tower. He never moved\nafter he was shot? Then what about that message? How did he know about\nthe cross-ties?\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d I shrieked. \u201cHere, let\u2019s get him out of this. We\u2019ll go down\non 77. I\u2019m through!\u201d",
