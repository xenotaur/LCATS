    "body": "              Lancelot Biggs was perhaps the worst second\n               mate Captain Hanson had ever shipped, and\n              he was convinced of it when he ruined their\n                   cargo. But how dumb a man is, may\n                   sometimes be a matter of opinion.\n\n\nSomething had gone a little haywire with my bug, and I had just\nrepaired it and was CQ-ing on the 20 band when the door opened and\nCaptain Hanson walked in.\n\nNaturally, I was surprised. We were only four hours out of the Venus\nH-layer, and I hadn't expected any visitors; least of all the skipper.\nBut he plunked himself down in the best chair and said, \"Sparks, look\nat me! What do you see?\"\n\nThat gave me a jolt. Even the best of them make the old dipsy-doo once\nin a while, but I never thought I'd live to see the day when Captain\nHanson went space nutty. He'd been with the Corporation, man and boy,\nfor more than thirty years now, and had never spent a day in dry-dock.\nI reached behind me cautiously and said in as soothing a voice as I\ncould muster, \"Why, I see a very nice man, Captain. Now, just you sit\nquiet for a minute. I've got to--\"\n\n\"Stop bein' a damned fool, Sparks!\" said the skipper wearily, \"An'\nput down that monkey-wrench! I'm not slippin' my gravs--yet. I'm just\naskin' you a simple question. What do you see?\"\n\nI said, \"Is it facts you're after, Cap, or am I allowed poetic license?\nIf it's facts, I see a swell, slightly gray-haired guy in his middle\nfifties who's been through the mill, knows space like a book, and--\"\n\n\"Wrong!\" said Hanson. \"Sparks, all radiomen are dumb. I guess that's\nwhy they're radiomen. What you see before you is a broken man. A man\nsadly buffeted by Fate and the dread clutch of circumstances. Not to\nmention meddlesome vice-presidents.\"\n\nThis time I got it.\n\n\"Biggs?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, Sparks. Biggs. Now tell me, man to man, what did I ever do to\ndeserve Biggs?\"\n\nHe had me there. Being the skipper of the _Saturn_ is not what I'd call\nan easy job under the best of conditions. The _Saturn_ is the oldest\nspace-lugger still doing active duty on Corporation runs. She was built\n'way back there before the turn of the century. For the past ten or\ntwelve years, she had been on freight service, having been judged unfit\nfor passenger duty by the SSCB--Space Safety Control Board.\n\nTo make matters worse, while we were taking on cargo at Sun City\nspaceport, the skipper had been called into the company offices. When\nhe came out again, he had this Biggs in tow.\n\nBiggs was tall. Biggs was lanky and gangly and all the other adjectives\nyou can think of that mean a guy's Adam's-apple sticks out. He was\noverflowing at the mouth with a great big grin, and he was as dumb as\nthey make 'em. He had his Third Mate's papers, and was entitled to be\nknown as \"Mister\" Biggs--the \"Mister\" being a nice camouflage for his\nreal name, Lancelot.\n\nBut--Biggs was the nephew of crusty old Prendergast Biggs, first\nvice-president of the Corporation. So there was nothing the skipper\ncould do but gulp and say, \"Very good!\" when they assigned Biggs to the\n_Saturn_.\n\nThere was nothing to prevent him from hoping Biggs would stumble over\nhis suitcases and bust his scrawny neck--but Biggs didn't do it. He was\nawkward enough to stumble, but lucky enough to fall on a cushion if he\ndid!\n\nI said gently, \"What's he up to now, Captain?\"\n\n\"What isn't he up to?\" groaned the skipper. \"First, he said he could\nhandle the gravs when we broke out of Venus' clutch. So--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I said, \"_He_ did that, did he?\"\n\n\"Stop rubbin' your head an' feelin' sorry for yourself,\" said Hanson.\n\"You got off lucky. Chief Garrity is nursin' two black eyes. One of the\nwipers has a busted arm. Everybody on the ship went floatin' off to the\nceiling, same as you did.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\" I asked.\n\n\"_Everything_ else!\" snorted Hanson. \"While we were all scramblin'\naround in midair, Biggs made a grab for the hand-controls. He got the\nmanual deflector by mistake. Todd has just finished shapin' the course\nrevision. We're point-oh-seven degrees off course now; almost three\nhundred thousand miles! We've got to up revs and waste fuel to get\nback, or we'll report in to Earth a day late. And you know what _that_\nmeans!\"\n\nSure, I knew what that meant. Cap on the carpet before the Board; the\nrest of us sitting around chewing our fingernails, wondering whether\nthey'd yank the _Saturn_ off the Venus run.\n\n\"Well, what are you going to do about him?\" I asked.\n\n\"What can I do?\"\n\n\"There's always the airlock,\" I suggested. \"Nobody would ever blame\nyou.\"\n\n\"This ain't no time to be funny, Sparks!\" complained the skipper.\n\"This is a serious problem. We've got a valuable cargo of _mekel_-root\nand _clab_-beans to take into New York. But if that guy messes up our\nflight any more--\"\n\nHe shook his head dolefully. I scratched mine. Then I got a brilliant\nidea.\n\n\"Cargo!\" I said. \"There's your answer, Captain!\"\n\n\"I'm listenin',\" said Hanson.\n\n\"Put Biggs in charge of the cargo. That way he'll be down in the hold\nthroughout the trip. He won't be up in the control turret to bother\nyou. And there's nothing he can do down there that'll hurt anybody.\"\n\n\"But that's the supercargo's job,\" frowned the skipper. \"Biggs knows\nthat.\"\n\n\"Sure. But Harkness will play along with you. Tell him to let on he's\nsick. Give him a vacation for this trip. He deserves it, anyway. Then\nit's logical enough to put Biggs on special duty below.\"\n\nThe skipper grinned.\n\n\"Sparks, I take it back what I said about radiomen. I think you got\nsomethin' there!\"\n\n\"Then you'll do it?\"\n\n\"Immediately,\" said Hanson, rising, \"if not sooner!\"\n\n\n\nSo that was that. That night my relief came on duty, and I went down to\nthe mess hall to eat whatever I could stomach of Slops' slumgullion.\nFirst person I met up with was Mr. Lancelot Biggs himself.\n\n\"Hello, Sparks,\" he said.\n\n\"Hello, yourself,\" I answered. \"What are you doing at this mess?\nThought you ate at the skipper's hour?\"\n\n\"I did until now,\" he grinned. \"Harkness was taken ill this afternoon,\nand the Skipper put me on emergency duty in his place.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" I said, looking as surprised as possible. \"Well, that's\nquite a job. Lot of responsibility, you know. That cargo's valuable.\"\n\nI had to grin at the way his lean face sobered.\n\n\"I realize that, Sparks. I'm devoting a lot of thought to the job,\ntoo. You know, I'm a bit of an experimenter, and it seems to me--\"\n\nOne of the mess boys brought on my chow then, and I didn't listen to\nthe rest of his chatter. Which was a sad mistake. If I had listened, I\nwould have been able to warn Captain Hanson that trouble was on the way.\n\nI think it was about the third day out that I began to smell those\nsmells. Yes, I know it was the third day, because I'd just contacted\nJoe Marlowe on Lunar Three, giving him declination and cruising speed\nof the _Saturn_. I thought it was funny, but guessed it would go away.\nIt didn't. It got worse. Finally, on the fifth day, I decided to do\nsomething.\n\nThere's nothing like meeting trouble halfway. I was just on my way from\nthe radio room to the control turret when I bumped smack into Captain\nHanson. It was a head on collision, but the Skipper's \"Oof!\" took\nlonger than mine, so I got to talk first.\n\n\"Listen here!\" I yelled, \"I've had about as much of this rickety old\ntub as I'm going to stand. If you can't put a stop to those stinks\nSlops makes in the galley--\"\n\nHanson gave me a look that would wilt lettuce.\n\n\"I don't want no trouble with you, Sparks!\" was his comeback. \"I\nbeen smellin' those smells, too. That's what I was aimin' to ask\n_you_ about. Have you been foolin' around with some of them chemical\nexperiments of your'n?\"\n\n\"I have not,\" I informed him loftily. \"And besides, while chemicals may\nstink sometimes, they don't ever give out a smell like the butt of an\noverripe cabbage. Except perhaps some of the sulphur compounds.\" Then I\nstared at him. \"I'm not kidding. I think those smells are coming up out\nof the galley.\"\n\nThe skipper groaned softly.\n\n\"Trouble. Nothin' but trouble. It ain't enough I'm supposed to shuttle\nthis barge between Earth an' Mars. Now I got smells to worry about,\ntoo. Well, come on! Let's look!\"\n\nWe went down to the galley. Slops was stirring something in a bowl. I\ntook one look and shuddered. Tapioca--again. And don't tell me you're\nnot supposed to stir tapioca. I know it. Tell Slops.\n\nThen the skipper loosed his blast.\n\n\"Okay, Slops,\" he snarled. \"We give up. Where'd you hide it?\"\n\nSlops looked puzzled.\n\n\"Hide what? I didn't hide nothin'. What is this, a game?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I chinned in. \"It's called Sniff-the-Atmosphere. You play it by\npressing your thumb and forefinger to your nostrils. Then you try to\nguess what died.\"\n\n\"Quiet, Sparks!\" roared the skipper. Then, to the cook, \"Well, Slops?\"\n\nSlops shrugged.\n\n\"I ain't done nothin',\" he protested. \"I ain't hid nothin', and I ain't\nsmelled nothin'. Now I got a meal on the fire. Go 'way and leave me\nalone.\"\n\nThe skipper looked at me, and I stared back at him. Both of us\nrealized the same thing at the same time. Slops wasn't lying. The smell\n_wasn't_ as bad here as it had been updeck.\n\nHanson scratched his head. He said, suspiciously, \"Sparks, are you sure\nyou ain't been mixin' chemicals?\"\n\n\"I'll swear it,\" I told him, \"on a pile of logbooks. That smell came\nfrom--Hey! What else beside the galley lies beneath my room and the\ncontrol turret?\"\n\n\"I'm a cook,\" said Slops, still stirring the tapioca, \"not a blueprint.\nDon't ask me.\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" snapped Captain Hanson. \"He ain't askin' you. Let's\nsee, Sparks. There's the storage closet ... the reservoir ... the\nrefrigeration tanks, and the--\" His eyes widened suddenly; fearfully.\n\"Sparks!\" he husked.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"The vegetable hold!\"\n\n\n\nMan, that was it! The minute he said it, I knew. The vegetable\nhold--and Biggs in charge!\n\nWe hightailed it for the nearest ramp. The minute we turned down the\ncorridor the smell got worse. Hanson blasted down the aisle like a\nrogue asteroid, with me trailing along behind. We hit the door; rammed\nit open--\n\nBiggs was in there. The darned fool was standing in there dressed in a\nbulger, calmly spraying the bins of _mekel_-root and _clab_ with a hose!\n\nHe turned as we entered and his eyes lighted behind the quartzite. His\naudiophone clacked pleasantly.\n\n\"Hello!\" he said. \"Is there anything wrong?\"\n\n\"Anything wrong!\" bellowed Captain Hanson. \"He asks if there's anything\nwrong! That--that suit! And that hose--\" The skipper's face was turning\npurple. \"And this _heat_!\"\n\n\"I turned off the refrigerating unit,\" clacked Biggs pleasantly. \"You\nsee, I had a theory that since the climate of Venus is warm and moist,\nit would be better for the cargo if I attempted to simulate its normal\nconditions of growth. So I--\"\n\n\"And the suit?\" roared Hanson. \"Why the bulger?\"\n\nBiggs moved his hands deprecatingly.\n\n\"Why, possible infection, you know. I didn't want to expose the\nvegetables to any organisms--\"\n\n\"Infect ... moisture ... heat....\" Captain Hanson gave up. He buried\nhis face in his hands. \"Tell him, Sparks! Tell him what he's doing!\"\n\nI said, \"Listen, Biggs--your theory is no good. _Clab_ and _mekel_ have\nto be kept in a cool, dry atmosphere or they rot. As a matter of fact,\nthey _are_ rotten! That's why the captain and I came down here--to\ninvestigate the smell. If you weren't wearing a bulger you'd notice it\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Smell?\" said Biggs. \"Why, now, come to think of it, I have noticed a\ncurious odor about the ship from time to time. But I thought it was\nrats!\"\n\nRats! On a space ship! Imagine!\n\nThat was the last straw for Hanson. He'd been trying, and trying hard.\nBut now he exploded.\n\n\"Biggs!\" he roared, \"You've ruined this cargo! Now you're relieved from\nyour command! But before you report to your quarters, I want every bit\nof this mess cleaned up. And I mean every last bit, understand? Junk\nit! Clear it out!\"\n\nBiggs faltered, \"B-but, Captain, I only tried to--\"\n\n\"You heard me!\"\n\nThe skipper wheeled, fiery with wrath, and strode to the doorway. I\nhurried after him. I whispered in his ear, \"Take it easy, Captain. He's\nthe vice-president's nephew. Maybe you ought to go slow!\"\n\n\"Slow?\" groaned the skipper. \"A fifty thousand dollar cargo ruined--and\nyou tell me to go slow? I'll see that idiotic son-of-a-space-wrangler\nfryin' in chaos. I'll blast him out of space if I'm blacklisted for it!\"\n\nI said nothing more. What was there to say? Fifty thousand bucks worth\nof cargo rotting in the hold. The Board would love that!\n\n\n\nThat was all until the next morning. The next morning I was on the\nbridge when Captain Hanson had a visitor. Garrity, the Chief Engineer.\nGarrity _never_ came to the bridge. So I knew, the minute I saw him,\nthat something was vitally wrong.\n\nIt was. Garrity's first words made that clear. He glared at the skipper\naccusingly from eyes that were still faintly purpled.\n\n\"Captain Hanson,\" he exploded. \"Would you be so kind as to tell me\nwhere I can find my Forenzi jars?\"\n\nHanson said, \"Forenzi jars? What are you talking about, Chief?\"\n\n\"You'll be knowing what a Forenzi jar is, no doubt?\" said Garrity\ncaustically. \"'Tis a lead container for battery solution. Yesterday\nthere were thirty of them in the storeroom. Today there are only a half\ndozen left!\"\n\nHanson said pettishly, \"Now, Chief, be kind enough to conduct your own\nsearch for the jars. I don't know anything about them. If you can't\nwatch your own equipment, don't complain to _me_ about it!\"\n\n\"I'm complaining to you, sir,\" said the Chief, \"for the verra simple\nreason that 'twas one of your men who removed them from the locker.\nYour third mate, Mister Biggs!\"\n\n\"Biggs!\" said Hanson. \"Biggs!\" His face reddened. He walked to the\nintercommunication unit, jabbed the button that connected with Biggs'\nquarters. \"Mr. Biggs?\" he yelped, \"Chief Garrity is up here in the\nturret asking about twenty-four lead containers that disappeared\nstrangely from his equipment locker. Do you know anything about--\"\n\nThe diaphragm clacked an answer. Hanson started. His eyes bulged. He\nyelled, \"What?\"\n\nAgain some metallic buzzing. This time Hanson didn't try to answer. He\ntottered away from the 'phone.\n\n\"G-Garrity,\" he faltered, \"will you be needin' the Forenzis before we\nmake port?\"\n\n\"Well, 'tis not exactly _vital_--\" admitted Garrity.\n\n\"But--why?\"\n\nHanson made a weak gesture.\n\n\"Because they're--out there!\"\n\n\"What?\" I said. \"Outside the ship? How come? Why?\"\n\nHanson's eyes were haunted.\n\n\"Biggs,\" he said in a hollow voice, \"thought they were garbage cans! He\nused them to dispose of the rotten cargo!\"\n\n\n\nWell, there wasn't any danger of the Forenzis getting lost, anyway.\nBut do you know I even had to point _that_ out to Mr. Biggs? Yes. That\nnight I got a personal message for him, and I took it down to his\ncabin. Being confined to quarters, he was lonely. He looked so abject\nthat I felt sorry for him, and lingered to talk for a while.\n\n\"I guess you think I'm a frightful dummy, Sparks,\" he said ruefully.\n\"And I know Captain Hanson thinks so. But--this is my first flight, you\nknow. And nobody ever told me what to use for garbage pails--\"\n\n\"Look, Biggs,\" I told him, \"there's no _need_ for garbage pails in\nspace. You can't just dump things out the airlock and expect to get rid\nof them.\"\n\n\"But Captain Hanson said to junk the spoiled vegetables.\"\n\n\"Junk. Not dump! They should have been thrown into the incinerator.\nYou see, anything tossed out of the _Saturn_ in free space just\nfollows along with the ship.\" I grinned. \"I'd hate to be one of the\nspaceport attendants on Earth when the _Saturn_ comes in surrounded by\ntwenty-four lead satellites full of garbage.\"\n\nHe picked me up on that one quick as a flash.\n\n\"But--but they won't be with us when we land, Sparks. As soon as we hit\nEarth's atmosphere, the friction will destroy the Forenzis and their\ncontents.\"\n\nI whistled softly.\n\n\"By golly, you're right. I clean forgot about that, and Hanson was so\nsore, he forgot it, too. That means we have to get those containers\nback into the ship before we hit the tropo, or we're going to lose a\ncouple hundred bucks worth of equipment.\"\n\nBiggs said meekly, \"I--I'll be glad to go out and reclaim them, Sparks.\nCan you fix it up with the skipper?\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" I told him.\n\nSo the next day I told Hanson about it. The Captain yanked his lower\nlip thoughtfully and agreed.\n\n\"Let him do it. That's better than giving him a free ride to Earth. And\nmaybe he'll slip into the rocket blasts?\"\n\nI passed the order on to Biggs; then went back to the radio room.\nJoe Marlowe was calling me from Lunar Three. And what he had to say\ndrove all other thoughts from my mind. His message came right from\nCorporation headquarters.\n\n\"Please report,\" it said, \"exact amount and probable value of cargo.\nMust have immediate reply.\"\n\nI shot through an O.K. and passed the message up to the skipper. Then,\nmy curiosity aroused, I contacted Joe on our private conversation band\nand asked him how come and why. He answered cautiously.\n\n\"Stock market taking nosedive in New York, Bert,\" he told me. \"Corp.\nbonds fading. Need this cargo badly.\"\n\nBoy, there was bad news! It was a private message, but I figured the\nOld Man ought to know it. So when he came in I passed it along. He\nstared at me.\n\n\"Hell's bells, Sparks! Then in that case, I can't send _this_!\"\n\n\"This\" was the message he had intended to relay: It said, succinctly,\n\"Cargo ruined. Value zero.\"\n\n\"If you do,\" I told him, \"we'll all be studying the want ads as soon\nas we hit port. Stock markets are screwy. This can't be a bad panic,\nor a fifty thousand buck cargo wouldn't be that important. But if the\nCorporation's under suspicion, and they learn the _Saturn's_ cargo is\nworthless--\"\n\n\"What will we do then?\"\n\n\"Stall,\" I suggested. \"Maybe by the time we get in, the situation will\nbe cleared up.\"\n\nSo we framed a message that wouldn't upset the apple cart too soon. It\nsaid, \"Value of cargo estimated at Sun City spaceport as $50,000.\" And\n_that_ was true enough....\n\n\n\nBiggs, with his unerring faculty for selecting the wrong moment, chose\nthis time to come bouncing into my radio room. He had taken off his\n_quartzite_ headpiece, but he was still wearing his bulger, and its\ndeflated folds hung around him like the poorly draped carcass of a\nVenusian mammoth.\n\nHe said, \"Hey, Sparks, have you got a book on energy and radiation?\"\n\n\"Help yourself,\" I said, pointing to my bookcase. \"Why, what's the\nsudden excitement?\"\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" he began, \"that maybe--\"\n\nCaptain Hanson let out a blat like an angry lion.\n\n\"Mister Biggs! I thought you were reclaiming those Forenzi jars?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I was. I mean--I am. But--\"\n\n\"Never mind the 'buts'! Get back to work!\"\n\n\"Y-yes, sir!\" Biggs saluted meekly; tossed me a grateful glance.\n\"Thanks, Sparks. I've got an idea, and if I'm right--\"\n\n\"Get out, Biggs!\" roared the skipper.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Biggs backed out hastily. He was thumbing the pages as he\ndisappeared. Hanson yanked his lower lip angrily.\n\n\"The Corporation goes busted. The _Saturn_ goes under the hammer. We're\nall out of jobs. And that--that insane young whippersnapper wants to\nplay school!\"\n\n\"He seemed mighty excited about something,\" I said.\n\n\"He'll be worse than that,\" promised the skipper, \"if he doesn't get\nthose jars back on board.\"\n\nAll this, to get Biblical about it, took place on the seventh day.\nThe _Saturn_ is a ten-day freighter. So we had three more days of\nheadaches before us till we slipped into New York spaceport.\n\nThey were three days of headaches, too. The skipper and I spent most\nof our time hanging over the radio, watching the progress of the stock\nmarket slump in New York. We hoped the situation would ease up so that\nour coming in with a zero cargo wouldn't make any difference--but no\nsuch luck. Somehow the rumor had gotten around that the _Saturn's_\ncargo would not be of sufficient value to keep the Corporation in the\nblue. And the Wall Street wolves were closing in, getting ready to snap\nif the rumor were true.\n\nIn the meantime, our stupid friend, Biggs, was taking a hell of a long\ntime to reclaim those Forenzis. It's really not a hard job, you know.\nAll he had to do was slip out through the airlock, throw a grapple\naround each jar, and bring it in.\n\nBut he seemed to be as awkward at this as at every other job he had\never attempted. On an off-period, I went down to watch him once. I\nfound he'd thrown grapples around the jars, but had not brought a\nsingle one into the airlock yet.\n\nI told him, \"You'd better get a wiggle on, Biggs. We hit the tropo\ntomorrow. If those things get into the atmosphere, you'll be able to\n_pour_ them into the airlock.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said abstractedly, \"but I'm not quite ready to--Sparks,\naccording to that book you lent me, cosmic rays go down to 1/100,000\n\u00c2ngstrom units.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I told him.\n\n\"That means they are more than ten times as intense as gamma rays.\"\n\n\"Right again. Why? What's the pay-off?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm trying to find out,\" he said strangely. He finished\ntying a loop around one of the jars; pushed himself free and toward the\nairlock.\n\n\"You want me to help you drag 'em in now?\" I asked.\n\n\"No thanks, Sparks. I think we'll leave them out till tomorrow,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"But Captain Hanson--\" I began.\n\n\"Tomorrow.\"\n\n\"After all, I'm just a radioman,\" I shrugged. \"It's your funeral,\" I\nsaid.\n\n\n\nHe got them inside the next day. I saw them lying in the corridor\nbeside the airlock, covered with a strip of tarpaulin. And he got them\nin just in time, too, for about an hour later we hit the Heaviside\nlayer.\n\nWe set out our Ampie and eased through all right. From there on, it\nwas just an easy coast to Earth. We threw out our lug-sails--the\nretractable metal fins which give \"space luggers\" their name--and put\non the power brakes. In a couple of hours we were settling into our\nhangar off New York spaceport.\n\nI closed out my key and locked the radio room. There was nothing more\nI could do now. So I went up to the control turret and found Captain\nHanson gnawing the fingernail of his index finger down to the second\njoint.\n\n\"Well, Captain?\" I said.\n\n\"Any late news, Sparks?\" he demanded anxiously.\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Only bad news. The Board's sending over their appraisers immediately.\"\n\nHe said wearily, \"Well, we did our best. If it hadn't been for that\ncrazy Biggs, we'd still have our cargo. But as it is--\"\n\n\"I wonder if International Stratoplanes need any radio operators?\" I\nsaid gloomily.\n\nWe were grounded now. As we walked down the corridor the motors went\noff, and I could hear the hiss of the airlock opening. We reached the\nport just as the committee entered. Doc Challenger was there, and Col.\nBrophy, and old Prendergast Biggs himself. I knew, then, that things\nwere in a bad state, or all the big bugs would not have come out.\n\nChallenger stepped forward, beaming.\n\n\"Happy landing, Captain!\" he chortled. \"I need not tell you how glad we\nare you came in safely. We've been experiencing bad times in New York,\nsir, bad times! But everything's all right now.\"\n\nHanson said, \"Yes, sir. But I've got something to tell you, sir--\"\n\n\"Later, Captain, later! First we must take up this cargo question.\nApproximately $50,000 worth of _mekel_ and _clab_--is that right? We\nhave our appraisers here. If your estimate is right, the Corporation\nwill weather this--er--mild storm.\"\n\nHanson coughed nervously. He hedged.\n\n\"Well, now, you see--about that there cargo--\"\n\nYou never saw three faces lose their smiles so suddenly. There was\nstony silence for a minute. Then Col. Brophy said in a deep voice,\n\"Captain Hanson, there's nothing _wrong_ in your estimate of the\ncargo's value, is there?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I mean the _estimate_ was right, but--\"\n\n\n\nIT was right here that young Lancelot Biggs interrupted.\n\n\"Excuse me, gentlemen,\" he said, \"but I don't quite understand. Is it\nimportant that we land a cargo of _clab_ and _mekel_?\"\n\nCaptain Hanson whirled on him.\n\n\"Biggs!\" he snapped sternly. Then he turned to old Prendergast Biggs.\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"I've delayed telling this as long as possible. But now\nI must tell you. This precious nephew of yours--\"\n\nThe old man smiled fatuously.\n\n\"Yes, yes, Captain Hanson. A fine lad, isn't he? What was it you were\nstarting to say, Lancelot?\"\n\nI grabbed Hanson's arm. I thought he was going to blow his tubes and\nhit somebody right then and there. But before he got a chance, Lancelot\nBiggs was talking again. To the Captain.\n\n\"Captain Hanson,\" he said seriously, \"I wish you'd told me this\nbefore. I didn't realize that our cargo was so important--\"\n\nThen he turned to the committee.\n\n\"I hope you will not be surprised to learn, gentlemen, that our cargo\nis not vegetable. At the last minute, Captain Hanson decided to make a\nchange--\"\n\nHanson's face turned white. He squawked, \"What! Are you trying to shift\nthe blame to--\"\n\nBiggs' voice drowned out his protest.\n\n\"--and so, gentlemen, we have placed the cargo right here for your\ninspection. Look!\" With a swift motion he tore the tarpaulin off the\nForenzi jars. I looked--and gulped! They were the same jars, all right.\nOnly different! They were no longer a dull, whitish metal. They were a\nglinting copper color! Biggs patted one of them affectionately.\n\n\"Ask your appraisers to estimate the value of these, gentlemen. I think\nthey'll find their value to be approximately a quarter of a million\ndollars. These are--_pure gold_!\"\n\nIt's a good thing I was holding on to Captain Hanson's arm. For just as\nthe committee was exclaiming, \"Excellent! Excellent trading, Captain\nHanson!\" the skipper's nerves gave out. He collapsed like a punctured\nbulger. I remember shouting, \"Water! Water, somebody!\" Then I passed\nout, too!\n\n\n\nAfterward, the three of us were alone in the turret. And Hanson was\nasking, \"But _how_, Biggs? I don't get it at all? How in blazes did it\nhappen?\"\n\nBiggs blushed and looked uncomfortable.\n\n\"Why, it's pretty obvious when you come to analyze it, Captain. I can't\nunderstand how it is that no one ever discovered it before, in twenty\nyears of space travel. But perhaps it's because ships and bulgers are\nmade of _permalloy_ instead of lead. Or it may be that some enzyme\nsecreted by the rotten vegetables acted as a catalyst. Lab workers will\nhave to study that.\"\n\n\"You're still not telling us what happened.\"\n\n\"Don't you know? It was transmutation, induced in the lead Forenzi jars\nby the action of cosmic rays.\"[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: Lead has an atomic weight of 207 plus, and its atomic\nnumber is 82. This atomic number corresponds to its net positive\nnuclear charge. Gold on the other hand, has an atomic weight of 197,\nwith an atomic number of 79.\n\nThe loss of two alpha particles and the loss of a single beta particle\nin a molecule of lead, causes that molecule to become an isotopal\nmolecule of gold, with an atomic number 79, and the atomic weight of\n199. For all practical commercial purposes, this is the same as true\ngold.--Author.]\n\nCaptain Hanson said in an awed tone. \"Exposure to cosmic rays done\nthat?\"\n\n\"Yes. Artificial transmutations were caused 'way back in the early\n20th Century through bombardment with gamma rays. And cosmic rays are\nmore than ten times as short as gammas.\n\n\"I began to suspect something strange was happening to the Forenzi\njars when I first went out to gather them in. Their color had changed\nslightly, and their exterior was rather more granular. That's why I\ncame in to borrow Spark's book on radiation. What I saw convinced me\nthat the lead was being transmuted; was then in the _mesolead_ stage;\napproximately an isotope of thallium.\n\n\"I decided to wait and see if the transmutation would continue--\"\n\nHanson wiped his hand across his forehead.\n\n\"Suppose there'd been more time? An' suppose'n the transmutation had\ngone on a step farther? What then?\"\n\n\"Well, now, there's an interesting question. The next element down the\nladder is platinum.[2] It's quite possible that--\"\n\n[Footnote 2: Platinum has a weight of 195 plus, and a net Positive\nnuclear charge of 78.--Author.]\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" interrupted the skipper. \"Did you say _platinum_?\"\n\n\"Yes. Why?\"\n\n\"Nothin'. That is, nothin' much.\"\n\nThe skipper rose and strode to the intercommunicating phone.\n\n\"Ross?\" he yelled. \"Listen--I want you to get this crate ready to roll\nagain. We're takin' off for Venus first thing in the mornin'. An', hey,\nRoss! Send to the warehouse for about five--no, make it six--dozen\nForenzi jars. Yeah, Forenzi jars, I said.\n\n\"And Ross--get the biggest ones they got! The Corporation ain't found\nit out yet, but we're goin' into the transmutin' business. And Mister\nBiggs comes aboard as First Mate!\"\n\n\n",
