Time, seventeen\nseconds flat. Next and last contestant in today\u2019s bulldogging is\n\u2018Curly\u2019 Bratton.\u201d\n\nPreston Campbell, the rodeo judge, gray-mustached Texan of the old\nschool, raised a hand toward the chute where the next steer waited, and\nthe red beast plunged wildly across the arena, desperate to leave\nbehind him the lithe youngster with the blazing neckerchief who\ngalloped on his flank.\n\nOpposite the middle of the grand stand the horse overtook the steer,\nswerved in, and Curly leaped and got the horns with not one lost\nmotion. Feet braced, he slid backward for two seconds, then man and\nsteer came to a struggling stop. For one more second they might have\nbeen a statue.\n\nThe animal\u2019s head, then, twisted slowly, grotesquely, as though it\ncocked its startled eyes to squint sidewise at the sky. Its feet went\nout from under it. Down together to the ground crashed bulldogger and\nbulldogged, and the youth\u2019s right hand shot upward in signal to the\njudge.\n\nThe Oklahoma Kid, who meantime had been returning across the field, out\nof the public picture, stopped beside Millie Wayne.\n\n\u201cCan you beat it?\u201d he demanded. \u201cDrop that hombre into a dipping vat\nand he\u2019d come up with a pocket full of oil wells! If I could ever get\nluck to break for me that-a-way----\u201d\n\nMillie was not listening. A bit breathlessly she was looking toward\nwhere Curly and the steer were rising out of the dust. It had been a\nwonderful throw. After exhibitions like that it had been Curly\u2019s habit\nto wave his hand at her--until the previous day.\n\nA messenger, cantering over from where old Pres Campbell sat on his\nhorse in the center of the field, handed a slip of paper to Foghorn\nMcNamara, who glanced at it and made due announcement:\n\n\u201cThat bulldogger was Curly Bratton. Time, eleven and two fifths\nseconds. The world\u2019s record is seven and two fifths seconds. Curly\nBratton wins today\u2019s bulldogging. Jack Marling, second. Billy Toms,\nthird. The next event is the cowgirls\u2019 trick-riding contest. The ladies\ntaking part----\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nMillie\u2019s teeth shut tightly over her lower lip. Curly had not looked at\nher at all. He had waved his hand toward the stand--toward one spot in\nthe stand, the same spot he had waved to yesterday afternoon, the spot\nwhere a brilliant toque hat made a splash of violent red. And under the\ncrimson splash a feminine hand waved back.\n\nIt was a soft, pinkly manicured hand, quite different from Millie\u2019s not\nunbeautiful but hard, competent ones. Millie had not failed to note the\ncontrast when its owner--her name was Florrine--had been introduced to\na lot of the performers by one of the resident managers of the show\nafter the first afternoon\u2019s contests. Millie had closely observed the\nface, too; an oval, olive face, artistically tinted, with languishing\ndark eyes. And the clothes.\n\nMiss Florrine wore modish clothes; Millie, even at the moment when\nCurly, shaking hands with the city girl, had awkwardly murmured his\ndelight at meeting her, had realized how they looked in comparison with\nher own picturesque but simple working garb. At the same moment she had\nsensed that the girl was attracted by Curly--as who wouldn\u2019t be?--and\nthat Curly was tremendously flattered and impressed.\n\nThen, not much later, Curly and Miss Florrine had spoken together at\nthe edge of the group, and Curly, that evening, carefully attired in\nhis most striking raiment, had left the hotel immediately after dinner\nand was still absent when Millie went to bed. The previous day he had\nwaved toward the red hat instead of at Millie. And now again on this\nday.\n\nMillie would be the second on the cowgirl program, and the first\ncontestant rode out to do her stuff. Millie cinched her horse, which\ndid not need it, and only half heard the Oklahoma Kid as he came\ncloser, having observed Curly\u2019s gesture toward the stand as well as\nshe, and suggested:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s you and me do a show or something in town tonight. Huh? Whatya\nsay, Miss Wayne? Let\u2019s.\u201d\n\nNothing in the world was farther from Millie\u2019s mind than going to a\nshow or anywhere else with Jack Marling, but she was angry and her\npride was hurt. She and Curly Bratton were not engaged, but everybody\nexpected them to be. His attention had been solely for her in half a\ndozen Western rodeos and chance had again brought them together at\nthis, one of the first real rodeos, and not a wild-West show, ever\ngiven on the Atlantic seaboard outside New York.\n\nFor the first day, Curly had been as attentive to her as ever--and then\nhe had met that handsome, sophisticated girl of the red hat.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d urged the Oklahoma Kid.\n\n\u201cWhatya say, Miss Wayne? A show and some good eats, somewheres.\u201d\n\nThat was precisely what she had promised to do, that night, with Curly.\nPromised it on the opening day of the show, before he had seen the\nFlorrine girl. Millie was conscious, as she straightened, that Curly\nwas approaching now, on his way to the dressing tents. Just as he\narrived within hearing, \u201cRed\u201d Peeks, the clown, came riding on his\ndonkey and stopped to pass Curly a .45 caliber pistol.\n\n\u201cThanky kindly,\u201d the clown said. \u201cNo more shootin\u2019 for today and I\nwon\u2019t need it tomorrow. My own\u2019ll be fixed.\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nDressed for bulldogging and hence with no holster, Curly held the\nweapon in his hand as he stopped beside Millie and the Oklahoma Kid.\nCurly did not like the Kid, but, more, he did not like to see him\ntalking to Millie. That he himself was thinking less of her, these\ndays, than of the girl whose bright headdress set off her olive skin,\ndid not alter this feeling; man in such matters is not consistent.\n\nHe hesitated a second, looked from one to the other and said:\n\n\u201cWe got a date tonight, Millie. Will you be ready \u2019bout seven?\u201d\n\nThis casual taking it for granted that he could do what he had done and\nnot suffer her resentment stirred Millie into cold anger, but she came\nof a stock trained not to exhibit emotion and merely smiled as she\nreplied:\n\n\u201cYou must have got your nights mixed, Curly. Because tonight I\u2019ve got\nan engagement with Mr. Marling.\u201d\n\nCurly\u2019s face fell almost comically. He stared from her to the grinning\nOklahoma Kid and opened his mouth as though to protest. Then he\nswallowed, turned away and walked toward the chutes.\n\n\u201cWhat time tonight, little one?\u201d Marling asked.\n\nHe was staggered by her answer and the flash of her eyes that\naccompanied it.\n\n\u201cNot any time,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext contestant,\u201d bellowed Foghorn McNamara, \u201cis Miss Millie Wayne!\u201d\n\nShe sprang into her saddle and was off toward the stand, while Marling,\nwho understood some kinds of women very well but her kind not at all,\ngazed open-mouthed after her. Turning, he also tramped toward the\nchutes and found Curly Bratton, his face harshly set, standing a little\napart from the other cowboys, waiting.\n\nCurly\u2019s voice was very low and his normal drawl was exaggerated.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, suh,\u201d he said to Marling, \u201cI\u2019d admire to have you\nnot meddle wi\u2019 that lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what the----\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have no quarrel with you, suh, but there ain\u2019t no\nreason why we shouldn\u2019t understand each other. She don\u2019t happen to know\nyou very well, I reckon, and of course I ain\u2019t the one to tell her--and\nI don\u2019t go round shootin\u2019 off any backcapping talk to ladies or any one\nelse--but she ain\u2019t the kind----\u201d\n\nThe Oklahoma Kid recovered from his astonishment.\n\n\u201cYou got some nerve, telling me who\u2019ll I\u2019ll take out and who I won\u2019t\ntake out. If it wasn\u2019t for the rules o\u2019----\u201d\n\n\u201cSh-h-h, if you please, suh. There ain\u2019t no reason for anybody else to\nknow----\u201d\n\nMarling raised his voice even louder.\n\n\u201cAnybody in the wide world can know as far as I\u2019m concerned, hombre! I\npick my own girls and my own girls pick me, Millie Wayne or anybody\nelse.\u201d\n\nThe group at the chutes had fallen silent, ears pricked.\n\nBratton spoke through his teeth, hardly more than a whisper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t mention no ladies\u2019 names.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho the blazes are you, to be telling me----\u201d\n\nA shadow fell upon them and Pres Campbell, ex-Texas Ranger, quietly\nwheeled his horse. His voice was level but authoritative.\n\n\u201cIf you boys got any quarreling to do, wait till after the show. You\nknow the rule about rowdyism. Well, I\u2019ll enforce it against both of you\nif I have to. What\u2019s it all about? If you\u2019re kicking about your\nbulldogging time, Marling, you\u2019re plumb wrong. I fined you five seconds\nbecause there wa\u2019n\u2019t no daylight showing between you and the steer at\nthe dead line, but that didn\u2019t change the result; even if you hadn\u2019t\nlost that five seconds Bratton still beat you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, that\u2019s all right, judge,\u201d Marling said.\n\n\u201cAnd you, Bratton, what you got that gun in your hand for? You know\nthere\u2019s a rule against carrying a gun except where they\u2019re called for\nin the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cI lent it to Red Peeks. His was busted. He just give it back to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. Go put it up. And don\u2019t let me hear any more ruckuses\nstartin\u2019 on this field.\u201d\n\nFully master of the rodeo and its contestants, old Pres turned and\ncantered back to the center of the field. The Oklahoma Kid had\ndisappeared into a tent and Curly, with not much time before the\ncalf-roping event, hastened to his own.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nMillie Wayne, unable to sleep, although the cowgirl in bed with her was\npiling up strength for the morrow like a child, heard the knock, not\nfar from midnight, on the door on the next room, heard Pres Campbell\u2019s\nquick call of \u201cWho is it?\u201d and the voice of one of the local rodeo\ncommitteemen in the hotel corridor, saying:\n\n\u201cSorry to wake you up, Mr. Campbell, but one of your men\u2019s been killed,\ndowntown, and the police have just come and got another one for doing\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Millie heard Campbell\u2019s feet hit the floor, his room\ndoor open. \u201cWho\u2019s killed? How?\u201d\n\n\u201cMarling. Curly Bratton did it, it seems. Shot him. The cops came out\nand found the pistol in his room. Recently fired. They had a quarrel\nthis afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in while I get dressed. I know about that quarrel--it was over\nthe bulldogging win. At least I thought it was; come to think of it, I\ndidn\u2019t hear a word of it. Where did they get to fighting? Which one\nwent after his gun first?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt don\u2019t seem to have been a fight,\u201d the local man said. \u201cMarling was\nshot in the back of the head.\u201d\n\nWide-eyed, Millie swung around to sit on the edge of her bed. She heard\nPres Campbell exclaim:\n\n\u201cThe thunder he was! I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 swore Bratton wa\u2019n\u2019t that kind of a boy.\nDoes he admit it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. He says he hasn\u2019t seen Marling since this afternoon\u2019s show. But he\ncan\u2019t prove where he was this evening. Says he was downtown till ten\no\u2019clock and didn\u2019t see anybody he knew that can alibi him.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d Pres invited, and she heard the door close.\n\nA murmur of indistinguishable words followed while the Texan dressed.\nHis close to sixty years had not lost him his habit of taking command\nof a situation or his ability to get into his clothes quickly, and\nbarely five minutes had elapsed before Millie heard his decisive:\n\n\u201cAll right, Mr. Taylor. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nShe had thrown on a kimono and stood in her doorway as committeeman and\none-time ranger came out.\n\n\u201cUncle Pres!\u201d she cried. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help hearing. He didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d the local man demanded, before Campbell could speak.\n\n\u201cI know him. He\u2019d never shoot anybody from behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust what I said,\u201d agreed the ex-ranger. \u201cBut what he seems to need is\nan alibi. Maybe, if you and he were together any----\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since he went out right after supper, and then I\ndon\u2019t think he saw me; I just noticed him going through the lobby,\u201d the\ngirl said. \u201cBut it\u2019s nonsense to charge him----\u201d\n\n\u201cHe and Marling quarreled this afternoon,\u201d put in Taylor. \u201cOver one of\nMr. Campbell\u2019s decisions.\u201d\n\nMillie knew nothing of the quarrel, of course. She could only say\nagain, stubbornly:\n\n\u201cBut he didn\u2019t do it. You\u2019re going to try to get him out, aren\u2019t you,\nUncle Pres?\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing to do everything I can,\u201d the old man replied. \u201cI don\u2019t guess\nwe\u2019ll be able to get him turned loose tonight, but first thing in the\nmawnin\u2019, if we have luck---- You go back to bed, Millie, and get your\nsleep. I\u2019ll let you know how things stand first thing in the mawnin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe and Taylor passed down the corridor and were standing at the\nelevator when Millie called him back and spoke too low for the local\nman to hear.\n\n\u201cCurly never would bring any lady\u2019s name into a thing where it might\nget into the newspapers unless he was sure it wouldn\u2019t hurt her,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cHe went---- I don\u2019t know it, but there\u2019s a girl----\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve sort of suspected there might be, noticing you two the last day\nor so,\u201d Campbell remarked dryly. \u201cWa\u2019n\u2019t none of my business, of\ncourse, but I couldn\u2019t help noticin\u2019. Some city lady, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sat in the same place in the grand stand every day, wearing a\nred hat----\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, I don\u2019t notice ladies\u2019 hats much,\u201d Pres said. \u201cMaybe, if you could\ngive me a better description----\u201d\n\n\u201cI was introduced to her, at the same time Curly was. Miss Florrine,\nher name is. She\u2019s--she\u2019s very pretty and well-dressed and\ncity-acting.\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019mph!\u201d grunted the ex-ranger. \u201cAnd boys don\u2019t have sense enough to\nknow when they\u2019re well off. Any more,\u201d he conceded, \u201cthen they did when\nI was one. Who is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Nothing except her name. But if his alibi had to include\nher, and for any reason he thought she ought to be protected, he\u2019d\nnever tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlorrine,\u201d said Pres. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a common name, or hard to remember.\nWhen I get to see him, I\u2019ll know what to ask about.\u201d\n\nIn the detective room at police headquarters, while Taylor remained\ndiscreetly silent, Pres Campbell met a character new in his\nexperience--the plain-clothes man promoted from pounding a beat, who\nhad never been outside a big city, never wanted to be, and oozed\ncontempt for every one and everything that was not metropolitan.\n\n\u201cYou bozos with big hats,\u201d he remarked heavily, \u201cthink you can get away\nwith murder. Nothing to it, mister; nothing to it. This Bratton guy did\nit and we\u2019ve got him. You and your gang of cowboys can\u2019t come into this\ntown and pull your rough stuff.\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nCampbell, whose competency in crime detection could be attested by\nthousands of Texans, was here unfamiliar with the laws, unacquainted\nwith police procedure and at sea as to his rights. One more familiar\nwith Southwestern characteristics than was Detective Moore would have\nnoted a glint in his eye and set of his jaw at the sneer. After the\nslightest hesitation, to be certain that he had his temper quite under\ncommand, the ex-ranger said:\n\n\u201cIf you would be willing to tell me a little, perhaps, about how you\nknow Bratton done it--that is, if it ain\u2019t defeatin\u2019 the ends of\njustice any way to tell---- You see, suh, I\u2019m in a sort of way the head\nof this outfit of ours, being the contest judge and so forth. If there\nisn\u2019t any reason why you should be afraid to tell me----\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, what would make you think I might be afraid of anybody in your\ngang?\u201d the detective demanded truculently. \u201cNot any, cowboy, not any! I\ndon\u2019t know how your constables out West go clean up a murder, but\nme--first thing when a guy gets bumped off like this man of yours, I\nlook for the frail.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrail?\u201d queried Pres.\n\n\u201cThe skirt; the jane; the woman. And this time it was easy. This\nBratton quarrels with Marling only this afternoon over her--and you\nknow that cussed well, because you stopped \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? I thought they were having words over one of my decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you did!\u201d scoffed the detective. \u201cWell, they wasn\u2019t. Half a dozen\nmen heard the girl\u2019s name when Marling spoke it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t. What was the name?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, are you trying to kid me? You know blame well it was\nWayne--Millie Wayne. One of them roughneck women with your show.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Moore,\u201d said Pres, very mildly, \u201cMiss Wayne\u2019s a right nice young\nlady, suh. I\u2019d admire not to have you speak like that about her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d \u2018admire\u2019 for me not to speak like that about a \u2018right nice\u2019\nyoung lady,\u201d mimicked Moore. \u201cListen, fella! You ain\u2019t out in the brush\nnow. You\u2019re in a town with bright lights in it. And I talk about women\nthat get mixed up in murders like they\u2019re supposed to be talked about.\nGet me?\u201d\n\nThe briefest second Pres Campbell fought for self-control and achieved\nit.\n\n\u201cYes, suh,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, if there ain\u2019t anythin\u2019 I can do to\nhelp----\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we need any help from yap deputy sheriffs, we\u2019ll broadcast for\nit,\u201d Moore answered.\n\n\u201cYes, suh,\u201d said Pres, and turned toward the door, observing that of\nthe three or four other detectives in the room, at least two were\ngrinning broadly. \u201cI\u2019ll bid you good night, suh.\u201d\n\nOut on the street, the local committeeman said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s that. I\ntold you my being with you would probably do you more harm than good,\nmy not being tied up with this city administration--but I don\u2019t know as\nyou\u2019d have done any better if you\u2019d gone alone. It\u2019s never a bad idea\nto have a witness along when you\u2019re talking to a man like that Moore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to see Curly and I\u2019d have liked to see Marling\u2019s body, too,\u201d\nthe ex-ranger replied, \u201cbut there wa\u2019n\u2019t any use asking after he got so\nplumb insulting.\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were walking slowly and now became conscious that footsteps behind\nthem were quickening. As they turned a corner and passed out of sight\nof the police headquarters entrance, a husky voice called cautiously:\n\n\u201cGo on past that street light and stop.\u201d\n\nCampbell, over his shoulder, recognized a thickset, elderly man as\nhaving been one of the audience during his interview with Detective\nMoore.\n\nTaylor whispered: \u201cDetective Graney. One of the old-timers on the\nforce.\u201d\n\nThey stopped in the shadow halfway down the block and Graney came\nponderously heavy-footed to stand beside them.\n\n\u201cKind of a raw deal Moore give you, back there,\u201d he remarked. \u201cHe don\u2019t\nknow nothing about folks from Texas, Moore don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you, suh?\u201d Campbell asked courteously.\n\n\u201cWell, a little,\u201d replied the detective. \u201cAnd here all I pounded after\nyou guys for was because I got kinda used to Texas fellas in the\nSpanish War, and most of \u2019em that I run into was good sports.\u201d He\nadded, ingeniously: \u201cAnd because this Moore--you don\u2019t need to go\nrepeating it, either of you, though it ain\u2019t any secret to him I think\nso--is a bonehead, right.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to consult the rest of you much,\u201d Pres remarked\ntactfully.\n\n\u201cHe never does; he knows it all himself,\u201d said Graney. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like\nhe was the chief, you know. It just happens, the chief being out of\ntown and the cap\u2019n off duty tonight, that he\u2019s sitting in at the top.\u201d\n\nGraney concluded bitterly:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a wise guy--I don\u2019t think.\u201d\n\nThe ex-ranger wasted no time seeking to learn what ancient departmental\nfeud between Graney and Moore might be at the bottom of this\nbitterness, but asked practically:\n\n\u201cWhat can we do, friend?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d inquired the detective, \u201cdo you want to do--short of getting\nyour man out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk with him--and I want to see the man that was killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Graney commented. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the second thing first--over\nat the morgue. After that we\u2019ll come back and you can see Bratton in\nhis cell.\u201d He explained this order of procedure by saying: \u201cMoore goes\noff duty at two o\u2019clock. The fella that takes charge then don\u2019t like\nhim much more\u2019n I do.\u201d\n\nTaylor at this point intimated that morgues had never entered into his\nlife and he hoped they never would. Campbell was entirely willing to\nexcuse him from further participation in the night\u2019s wanderings. The\nex-ranger and Detective Graney, presently, were viewing the body of the\nreckless and once handsome Oklahoma Kid, awaiting the official autopsy\nthat would take place in the morning.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt his first glance, the Texan spoke with relief.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere ain\u2019t any doubt about his being shot from\nbehind. I was afraid some mistake had been made about that and if it\nhad been done from in front, it might \u2019a\u2019 been a fight. Where\u2019s the\nbullet?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never found it,\u201d Graney said. \u201cThe killing, you see, was out of\ndoors. In that alley that leads up to the side door of the Monaco\nCabaret.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it gets found. Because I\u2019m sure Curly Bratton ha\u2019n\u2019t got any\ngun except a .45. All the pistols in our outfit are that caliber. And\nthere ain\u2019t any way of proving it without that piece of lead, because\nbullets don\u2019t always act just the same in all cases--but I\u2019d gamble the\nbest hawse I\u2019ve got that this hole wasn\u2019t made by any Colt. Looks to me\nas if it was too small going in and too big coming out. When you find\nthat bullet, if it isn\u2019t busted so its weight don\u2019t prove anything, I\u2019m\nsayin\u2019 it\u2019ll be a .38 at the biggest, and perhaps a .32.\u201d\n\nHis eyes fell upon the pile of clothing that had been stripped from the\nbody.\n\n\u201cSay, Mr. Graney!\u201d he demanded. \u201cAre you sure all these clothes were\nMarling\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cBound to be,\u201d the detective said. \u201cThe system they\u2019ve got here,\nthere\u2019s no chance of a mix-up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took \u2019em off him myself,\u201d put in the morgue attendant who\naccompanied them. \u201cDon\u2019t touch \u2019em. The coroner ain\u2019t looked \u2019em over\nyet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aiming to,\u201d Pres assured him. \u201cI\u2019ve been a peace officer\nmyself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with \u2019em?\u201d Graney asked.\n\n\u201cNothing. Only he didn\u2019t usually wear a red handkerchief around his\nneck. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nThrough steel bars, Pres talked with Curly Bratton. Detective Graney\nwas kind enough to stand back out of earshot.\n\n\u201cRight off, firsthand,\u201d Campbell said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, son, I don\u2019t\nbelieve you did it. And Millie, she was right positive. Wouldn\u2019t make\nany difference how much evidence these police thought they had, she\u2019d\nknow better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t told me all the details of what they think,\u201d Curly\nremarked, \u201cbut they\u2019ve got hold of that quarrel the Kid and me had this\nafternoon. I don\u2019t know how much the boys heard--I don\u2019t think they\nheard anything I said--but I was declaring myself to him after I found\nout him and her were going out to supper together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were?\u201d exclaimed Pres. \u201cThey didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt was Curly\u2019s turn to exhibit astonishment.\n\n\u201cShe told me they were going to,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t---- Tell you\nthe truth, judge, she and me had a date for supper tonight and when you\ncome up on the Kid and me, that-a-way, she had just a few minutes\nbefore turned me down and said she was going with him--told me with him\npresent. And while I didn\u2019t so much care right at that minute about her\ngoing with me, thinking of her going out with him got me mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want her to go with you? If she didn\u2019t, were you going\nto meet the Florrine lady?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, judge! Her name isn\u2019t going to get into it, too, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you going to stop these police digging up all sorts of\nthings?\u201d Pres countered. \u201cAnd if Miss Florrine can alibi you----\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she can\u2019t,\u201d Curly protested. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since this\nafternoon at the rodeo and then I didn\u2019t see her to speak to.\u201d He\nhesitated a second, then said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to drag any nice lady\u2019s\nname into this, judge, but between you and me I was looking for her,\nMillie having turned me down and all that. But she wasn\u2019t where she and\nI met last night. So I looked round a while and then went home and went\nto bed.\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe explained further. \u201cBeing kind of upset, one way and another, I\nforgot to clean my pistol like I\u2019d intended to. Red Peeks had used it\nfor the show, you know. And the police, finding it had been\nfired--telling \u2019em about Peek\u2019s firing it made no difference, because\nit wouldn\u2019t be no dirtier if I had fired it afterward----\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d interrupted Campbell. \u201cYou didn\u2019t call on Miss Florrine at\nher home, I take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe thought her folks might object, me being a cowboy and all,\u201d Curly\nconfided. \u201cSo we met at one of these cabaret dance places--the Monaco\nis the name of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Monaco, eh? Who did you see there you knew--not last night when\nyou were with Miss Florrine, but tonight, when you couldn\u2019t find her?\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody,\u201d declared Curly with obvious sincerity. \u201cNot a soul. I went in\nand looked around and she wasn\u2019t there, so I bought me a drink for\nmanners, and pretty soon I went out and looked in a couple other places\nand then I beat it home to the hotel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas there anybody in the alley when you came out of the Monaco?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlley?\u201d Curly queried. \u201cWhat alley?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere the side door is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never noticed any side door on any alley. Me, I went in at the\nfront--tonight and the other two times I\u2019ve been there. I went there\nthe first time with Pearl--I mean Miss Florrine----\u201d\n\n\u201cGot real well acquainted for three days, didn\u2019t you, son? Quite a few\nfolks must have noticed it, one place and another. And it never\noccurred to you, I s\u2019pose, that when Millie said she wa\u2019n\u2019t going to\nsupper with you, it might be because she thought prob\u2019ly you\u2019d rather\nbe out again with the new girl. I don\u2019t know that, but I don\u2019t guess\nit\u2019s a bad shot in the dark.\n\n\u201cGirls are fussy that a way about dividing their time with new ladies,\u201d\nhe went on. \u201cMillie didn\u2019t tell me either that or anything else about\nit all, but I gathered from something she said that you had trompled on\nher feelings. That didn\u2019t stop her saying she knew you didn\u2019t kill him,\nthough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho do you suppose did, judge?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more idea\u2019n the man in the moon,\u201d Pres had to admit. \u201cBut we aim to\ndo some investigatin\u2019 between now and sunup, me and this friend of mine\nthat\u2019s a detective. I see you\u2019re wearing the usual red handkerchief.\u201d\n\nCurly\u2019s fingers went to it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with things?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d the ex-ranger replied. \u201cI dunno as it\u2019s got anything to do\nwith \u2019em a-tall. I only happened to notice it. Have you happened,\nescortin\u2019 her round to one place and another, to meet any of Miss\nFlorrine\u2019s friends?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember any names. Just folks we met there in the Monaco and\nanother dance place we went into.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll seem to be well-dressed, up-to-date folks?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Look here, judge, there ain\u2019t no reason to go ringing her or her\nfriends in on a mess of trouble like this. Her folks are kinda\nold-fashioned and don\u2019t like her to go round to dance halls where it\u2019s\nlively----\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of old folks are that a way. Did you say they were father and\nmother both?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say. I don\u2019t know as I ever heard her mention. What\ndifference does it make? I didn\u2019t find her tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so; so you didn\u2019t. Well, I\u2019m sorry to leave you here, son, but\nI\u2019ve got to. We\u2019ll be doing all we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cA habeas corpus and reasonable bail and----\u201d Curly began, but Campbell\nshook his head.\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t Texas. Up in this country they don\u2019t fix reasonable bail\nfor homicide. But keep smilin\u2019. Your friends are all on the\njob--especially Millie.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, judge,\u201d said the cowboy with some embarrassment. \u201cI been kinda\nfoolish, maybe. These new folks I met are right nice folks, but I\ndidn\u2019t really---- I don\u2019t s\u2019pose anything can be done to square it, but\nsitting here I\u2019ve been thinking that our own kind o\u2019 folks is our own\nkind o\u2019 folks. If Millie could sort o\u2019 forgive----\u201d\n\n\u201cCurly,\u201d said the older man, \u201cMillie\u2019s daddy and me were friends as\nlong as he lived--such good friends that she\u2019s been callin\u2019 me \u2018uncle\u2019\never since she was old enough to talk. I aim, when she gets married, to\ndo anythin\u2019 an old-timer like me can do to see she gets a fairish sort\nof husband.\n\n\u201cPersonally,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019d rather she took a kid that had made a\nfew kinds of fool of himself and got over it than one that city glitter\nwas going to get some time after he married, maybe. Millie\u2019s got a heap\no\u2019 sense. She might see it the same way--and then, again, she mightn\u2019t,\ndependin\u2019 upon whether the fool kid acted like he\u2019d got over it or\nnot.\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cListen, judge,\u201d said Curly. \u201cFrom the minute she \u2019lowed she was going\nto eat with Jack Marling, I\u2019ve been looking at things different. I\ndon\u2019t s\u2019pose she could understand that starting right out to try to\nfind another lady was a sort of--a sort of getting square, as you might\nsay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose she could--not right away,\u201d Pres replied. \u201cBut time\nand good fruits of repentance has given her confidence in many a hawse\nthat was a right bad bronc when she first forked him. So long, son!\nDon\u2019t go to frettin\u2019 too much--about anything.\u201d\n\nOut on the street again, Campbell said to Graney:\n\n\u201cWhat sort of place is that Monaco Cabaret?\u201d\n\n\u201cBum!\u201d the detective answered. \u201cBut prosperous. The gang that hangs out\nthere has plenty money, these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cBootleggers among \u2019em, maybe?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hijackers and a few other things. And sports that like to travel\nwith \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust between ourselves, did you ever hear of a young lady named Pearl\nFlorrine?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018The Red Pearl?\u2019\u201d Graney replied promptly. \u201cSome stepper!\u201d\n\n\u201cRed?\u201d\n\n\u201cFits her two or three ways. For one thing, she always wears it.\nAnother, she trains with Reds, anarchists, or communists or sump\u2019n--I\ndon\u2019t pretend to know just which kind they belong to. Her regular\nmarried name is Ricotti, although Angelo don\u2019t go by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngelo?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer husband. He calls his last name \u2018Rich.\u2019 \u2018Quick\u2019 Rich is how the\ngang knows him. Got it--though we\u2019ve never been able to convict him--by\nhis speed in pulling a gat.\u201d\n\n\u201cA gunman?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. What\u2019s all this got----\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been out o\u2019 town the last week or so, but I seen a report from\none of our railroad station men that he got back, unexpected, about six\no\u2019clock tonight--last night, I mean; it\u2019s morning now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Graney,\u201d promised Campbell with confidence, \u201cyou take me to Angelo\nRicotti, and think up a good way to get him mad and talkative, and I\u2019ll\ngive you a laugh on Mr. Detective Moore that he won\u2019t get over till\nTexas is annexed back to Mexico.\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nBriefly, he went into details. Unhesitatingly, enthusiastically,\nDetective Graney agreed with him.\n\nIt was a little past three o\u2019clock when they found Quick Rich in the\nback room of a hang-out whose sentry they and the policeman on the beat\nhad succeeded in suppressing without any alarm being given. One other\nman was present and Campbell seized and disarmed him while Graney\njammed a pistol into Rich\u2019s midriff and took from his coat a .38\nautomatic with its barrel powder stained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good, Quick,\u201d the detective said, when the handcuffs were on.\n\u201cWe know all about the killing. The Pearl turned you in.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo she was there, was she?\u201d raved Angelo. \u201cIf I\u2019d seen her, I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019\nmade a double job of it. Well, I got him anyway, the whelp! Waving his\nhand at her every day in the grand stand in front of five thousand\npeople--and her waving back! And the nerve to take her out and make a\nfool of me to the whole gang! And Pearl--just because we had some\nwords--kidding him along, with his big hat and cowboy clothes and red\nhandkerchief!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou identified him by his red handkerchief, of course, just as he was\nheading into the side door of The Monaco,\u201d Pres suggested mildly.\n\n\u201cSure I did! They told me he was the only one of that wild-West crowd\nthat ever wore one. Who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Campbell,\u201d said Detective Graney unctuously, \u201cis a guy from Texas\nthat used to be a Roughrider. And him and me is going to do some more\nroughridin\u2019--with a certain know-it-all gent to be rode--along about\ncourt time in the mornin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoore was right at that, in a way,\u201d murmured the ex-ranger as the\npatrolman left to ring for the patrol. \u201c\u2018Look for the woman;\u2019 that\u2019s as\ngood a rule in some killin\u2019s in Texas as it is here in the East. And I\nfollowed his hunch and did the same thing. But down in my part of the\ncountry we use words some different. When we say women, we usually\ndon\u2019t mean ladies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",
