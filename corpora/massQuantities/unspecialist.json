    "body": "_A machine can be built to do any accurately described job better than\nany man. The superiority of a man is that he can do an unexpected,\nundescribed, and emergency job ... provided he hasn\u2019t been especially\ntrained to be a machine._\n\n\n\n\nBanner ripped open his orders, read them, stared in disbelief for a\nquick moment, then cursed wildly while reaching for the telephone.\n\n\u201cHello, Gastonia? Yes, I got \u2019em. What kinda way to waste our time you\nlunkheads think ... oh, it\u2019s you, colonel!\u201d\n\nBanner dropped the receiver and let it dangle. He sank into the only\nsoft chair in the apartment and watched hypnotically as the phone\u2019s\nreceiver limply coiled and uncoiled at the end of the wire.\n\nSomebody knocked on, then opened the door. \u201cHi, pretty boy, you got our\norders?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on in and hear about it,\u201d Banner said. He got up from the chair,\nran his hands compulsively through his recently short-cropped red hair,\nhung up the phone and shoved the orders into his co-pilot\u2019s hands.\n\nHarcraft read them over three times, then sank into the chair just\nvacated by Banner. Finally\u2014while Banner poured them both a drink\u2014he\nmanaged to blurt, \u201cPotato fertilizer and tractor fuel\u2014Oh, no. Oh, no,\nno, no!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, yes, yes,\u201d Banner said bitterly. \u201cWe are heroes of the\nspaceways; yes, indeed. We train for ten years. Acquire great skill in\nthe art of the patrol. We dedicate ourselves to the protection of the\nFederation. We ready ourselves for war. We gird our young, strong\nloins, we\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting hysterical,\u201d said Harcraft, who poured himself another\ndrink, began pacing the floor and took up where Banner had left off.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never even been lost on patrol. And now they do this. It\u2019s\nunbelievable! Potato fertilizer and tractor fuel. We\u2019re supposed to\ntravel thirty-six light-years, pick up one thousand sleds of the stuff,\ndeliver it to some God-forsaken farm planet another thirty years out,\nand return to base. You know what they\u2019ll do then?\u201d He turned to\nBanner, pointed his finger accusingly and repeated, \u201cYou know what\nthey\u2019ll do then?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow would I know,\u201d said Banner, glumly staring into his drink.\n\n\u201cWell, I can tell you what they\u2019ll do. Yes, sir, I can tell you.\u201d\nHarcraft\u2019s pudgy face and oversize brown eyes seemed to melt into each\nother, giving him the appearance of an angry, if not very bright,\nchimpanzee.\n\n\u201cO.K., what\u2019ll they do?\u201d Banner said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll give us medals. That\u2019s what they\u2019ll do. For safe delivery of\none million tons of tractor fuel, you two fine specimens of manhood are\nhereby presented with the Order of the Oil. And for your courageous\nservice in delivering two million tons of potato fertilizer, you are\nalso awarded the shield of\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d Banner said. \u201cIt could be worse. They could\u2019ve saddled us\nwith a Bean Brain. Come on. Let\u2019s go to some bar and get sober. We\u2019re\nleaving for freight duty at 1700.\u201d\n\n\nThe Bean Brain met them at the air lock. \u201cName is Arnold. Here\u2019s my\norders.\u201d Banner stared at Harcraft, Harcraft stared at Arnold.\n\n\u201cGet inside,\u201d said Banner.\n\nThe Bean Brain smiled, \u201cEr ... could you sort of lead the way? I\u2019ve\nnever been inside a ship before. If you got some kind of can, it would\nsave a mess. I\u2019ll probably vomit a while.\u201d\n\nThey stopped calling him Bean Brain three days later. He was still\nsick, miserably spacesick, and neither Banner nor Harcraft had the\nheart to keep needling him. On the fourth day he managed to get up and\naround. They ate their first meal together that day. \u201cLet\u2019s get\nsomething straight right off the bat,\u201d Banner said. \u201cNeither Harcraft\nnor I got anything against you \u2019cept prejudice. That right, Harcraft?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Harcraft said.\n\n\u201cIn short,\u201d continued Banner, between puffs on a cigarette, \u201call we\nknow is what we\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not good,\u201d said Harcraft.\n\n\u201cItem one,\u201d said Banner, blowing smoke at the ceiling ventilator.\n\u201cPatrol Command came up with the Bean Brain idea about six months ago.\nPatrol Command, in its infinite wisdom, has never seen fit to explain\n_why_ Bean Brains are sometimes assigned, evidently at random, to small\npatrol vessels such as this. The orders always state that the\n\u2018passenger\u2019 will accompany pilot and co-pilot throughout the entire\ntrip, will obey orders, yet is equal in rank to the ship\u2019s commanding\nofficer. The Bean Brain has no duties aboard. This seems to make sense,\nat least, since Bean Brains aren\u2019t trained for anything and can\u2019t do\nanything.\u201d\n\n\u201cItem two,\u201d said Banner, taking his eyes off the ceiling and pointing a\nfinger at Arnold. \u201cI have, or had, two good friends\u2014both patrol\ncaptains\u2014who had the honor of taxiing Bean Brains around the universe.\nOne never came back. The other, Captain Slatkin, came back and got a\nbig medal for reasons he\u2019ll never talk about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Slatkin liked to brag,\u201d said Harcraft, knowingly.\n\nArnold stood up slowly. He was a small man, but as he looked up at the\nship\u2019s pilot and co-pilot, he gave both the impression of height and\nstrength. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something, too,\u201d he said, speaking slowly as\nif in pain. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Bean Brains are assigned to ships like\nthis either. I\u2019ve never been told. I took the job because I didn\u2019t like\nwhat I was doing before. I\u2019ve never had any real training, and this\nseemed like a chance to do something that sounded like fun.\n\n\u201cLike I said, I\u2019ve never been told anything. They tested me for a lot\nof things, then gave me my orders and told me to come along. And if\nyou\u2019re wondering, I flunked the ESP tests, so there\u2019s nothing there.\nYou want to consider me dead weight? O.K., your privilege. Leave me\nalone if you want to, I\u2019ll do the same. Be friendly, I\u2019ll be friendly.\nAsk me to help. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\n\nThen he got up and went back to his bunk.\n\n\nDuring the next six weeks, Arnold spent most of the time in his bunk,\nscanning tapes from the ship\u2019s micro-library on an overhead viewer. At\nmeal times he was polite, offering no further information about\nhimself, yet entering into any conversation that centered around such\ntrivia as terrestrial sports, taxes, money, liquor, food, government\nagencies. By mutual, if silent, agreement, neither women nor work were\ndiscussed.\n\nWorking in the ship\u2019s control room, sometimes together, sometimes\nspelling each other, Banner and Harcraft speculated bitterly and\nendlessly about their passenger. Theories to explain his presence\u2014most\nof them propounded by Harcraft\u2014were created, torn apart, modified,\nexploded, in giant sequences of effort which left both men finally\nexhausted and tired of the whole business.\n\nOn the second day of the seventh week out, their ennui vanished. A ship\nwas picked up by the spec-spanner, and at their delight at the break in\nroutine, they summoned Arnold up to the cabin.\n\n\u201cTake a good look,\u201d said Banner, \u201cit\u2019s an Ankorbadian ship. Probably\nthe first and last you\u2019ll ever see.\u201d Arnold watched as Banner\u2019s finger\ntracked a slowly moving point of light across a recessed ceiling\nscreen.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Harcraft, \u201cyou are looking at the representatives of\nmankind\u2019s only sibling. The noble Ankorbades.\u201d Then he recited in a\nsingsong voice:\n\n\u201cA simple race the Ankorbades\nThey wear no clothes and live in caves\nBut out in space they do in minutes\nWhat our ships do at speeds infinite.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCultural paranoia,\u201d added Harcraft.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean just what I said. You and a million others recite that ditty,\nor variations of it every day of the week. It all adds up to the fact\nthat the world is full of small-egged animals who for ten years have\ndone nothing but just scream that we\u2019re about to be attacked by the\nsavage Ankorbades.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Tch, tch_,\u201d said Banner, \u201ctreason, my lieutenant, treason. Of you I\nhad expected at least a show of chauvinism.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop _tch-tch_ing me,\u201d Harcraft said irritably. \u201cYou\u2019ve known how I\nfelt about this mess for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said Banner, yawning, \u201cever since you took that\nmicro-course in culturology you have insights into the situation denied\nto the rest of the race.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Harcraft said, making a small adjustment on the screen, \u201cyou\nand countless other atavisms are reacting in a very predictable way.\nSince you can\u2019t reconcile the naked Ankorbades and their superior\ntechnology, and since they are alien to point of showing no interest\nwhatsoever in our elaborate art, institutions, rituals\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd since,\u201d piped up Arnold, startling both men, \u201cthe human\nunconscious can\u2019t help but equate nakedness with savagery, we have\narmed our mighty planet to the teeth, convinced that Armageddon is\naround the corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the surprised Harcraft.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you pick that up,\u201d asked Banner.\n\n\u201cFrom Captain Slatkin,\u201d said Arnold, smiling. \u201cI met him when I was\nindoctrinated. He took the same micro-course in culturology. \u2019Course,\nhe only believed that stuff when he was scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t say,\u201d said Banner. \u201cTell us, my little friend, are you\ntoo, convinced that Armageddon is around the corner? Not that I really\nthink you\u2019re capable of having an opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got plenty of opinions, all right,\u201d said Arnold quietly, staring at\nhis shoes. \u201cOpinion number one is this: We\u2019re not really at war yet,\nbut within the past two years, fifty-six patrol ships have disappeared\nin the vicinity of our friendly neighbor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an opinion,\u201d Banner said. \u201cAnd disappeared can mean a lot\nof things.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpinion number two,\u201d continued Arnold, scratching himself under an\narm. \u201cAbout the only diplomatic relations we got with them animals is\nwhen they write a note complaining about some Patrol ship getting too\nclose to some piece of dirt in their system.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of that, you\u2019ll have to excuse me for a moment,\u201d Harcraft\nsaid.\n\n\u201cStop clowning,\u201d snapped Banner. \u201cListen to him. Here\u2019s your chance to\nget some insight into the nature of the thorn in your side. Go on, Bean\nBrain. Any more opinions?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. If you\u2019re such a wise guy, tell me why you\u2019re here right now.\nWhy?\u201d Arnold\u2019s mouth screwed itself into a knowing, bitter smile. \u201cWhen\nboth of you were children you heard the story about the Big Fleet. So\nyou made it into the Patrol, spent the rest of your life training,\nlooking, thinking that some day\u2014\u201d\n\nHarcraft broke in, \u201cThat tale about an Ankorbadian fleet build-up has\nbeen discredited a full thousand times. When they pried that crazy\nscout out of his ship, he was an hour away from the crematorium. You\ntry spending forty-six days in space without food or water sometime!\nYou\u2019ll see hidden arsenals of alien ships till hell won\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d added Banner, \u201cwhere is this fleet build-up supposed to take\nplace? The patrol has had every planet in reachable space under\nscheduled surveillance for the past twenty years. You don\u2019t hide a\nthousand S-type cruisers in somebody\u2019s pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo nobody\u2019s scared, huh?\u201d said Arnold. \u201cSo the entire space command\nhas been playing footsie all over the galaxy for twenty years looking\nfor a thousand ships that aren\u2019t there in the first place, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoutine surveillance,\u201d said Harcraft.\n\n\u201cA thousand ships,\u201d said Arnold, slapping his sweating forehead.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll burn through our defense system like\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a paranoid rabble rouser,\u201d said Banner lightly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got work\nto do up here. How about getting back to your bunk?\u201d\n\n\nTwo days later they made scheduled contact with the caravan of potato\nfertilizer and tractor fuel. One thousand sleds, in tandem, were in\nproper orbit two hundred miles above Sedor II. Their orders provided\nfor a landing on the planet and a short ship-leave, at the discretion\nof the ship\u2019s pilot to refresh personnel.\n\nBanner and Harcraft decided against landing. All necessary contact, now\nthat they were out of hyperdrive, could be accomplished with the ship\u2019s\nradio. Short planetfalls were, psychologically, more trouble than they\nwere worth, often destroying the hard-earned, delicate space\norientation which was their only defense against the abysmal boredom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dull place anyway,\u201d explained Harcraft to Arnold, who had come\nup to the control room. \u201cIt\u2019s a mining and processing settlement. Maybe\nfive hundred families altogether. Got a funny religion, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh, what kind?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d began Harcraft breezily, \u201csort of sacrificial you might say.\nThey believe in killing strangers who annoy their women.\u201d\n\n\u201cA dull place,\u201d agreed Arnold, wiping his nose with his sleeve.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of religion,\u201d said Banner, \u201cI just talked to their monitor on\nthe radio. They\u2019ve picked up twelve big ships on their scanner during\nthe past two days.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnkorbades?\u201d asked Arnold quickly.\n\n\u201cUh-huh. But not what you think. It\u2019s Easter time or some such thing at\nhome. They all return to the home planet and stay there for about\nthirty days in the spring. Religious festival.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. They paint themselves blue and howl at both of their moons\nfor a month. I read about it once.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be home, too, pretty soon,\u201d ventured Harcraft, for whom the\nreturn journey was subjectively always short.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hitch up to those sleds,\u201d Banner said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get going.\u201d\n\nFour weeks later two of the fertilizer sleds went out of phase and\nautomatically cut the ship out of hyperdrive.\n\n\u201cA welcome diversion,\u201d said Banner to Harcraft, \u201cyou are now about to\nmeet your mortal enemy face to face.\u201d\n\n\u201cManual labor? Never,\u201d said Harcraft, assuming the pose of a man\nbravely facing the firing squad. \u201cPatrol duty is my lifeblood. Even\nfreight duty such as this I can stomach. But manual labor! Please\ncaptain, let the air out of the ship, if you will, but never shall\nthese hands\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody call me?\u201d asked Arnold, appearing silently.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Banner, \u201chow\u2019d you like to help?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, what you got.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouple sleds are out of phase. You and Harcraft are going to slip into\nsuits and go out and find the trouble.\u201d\n\nArnold shrugged, \u201cO.K. with me, when do we start?\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty quick,\u201d said Banner, who had turned to look at the ship\u2019s\nspec-scanner. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re in a belt of meteorites. We\u2019ll be able\nto match velocities, but we could still be creamed if the path gets too\neccentric. Show him the way, Harcraft. I don\u2019t want to take any longer\nthan necessary, either. Understand?\u201d\n\nFifteen minutes later, both Arnold and Harcraft were out of the air\nlock, each clutching a new phase unit. Harcraft called instructions to\nArnold over his suit\u2019s inter-com, but within minutes the smaller man\nwas, if anything, more adept at the business of maneuvering himself\nthrough the void than his teacher. They replaced the phase unit in the\nfirst sled\u2014the fiftieth from the ship\u2014with Harcraft doing the work and\nArnold watching.\n\n\u201cCan you do the next one alone?\u201d Harcraft asked.\n\n\u201cEasy as pie,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout two hundred sleds farther back. Numbers on the side. Number two\nhundred sixty-three. Can you remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t dumb. Where you gonna be?\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in the ship. We\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d\n\n\nBack again in the control cabin with Banner, Harcraft was about to\ncongratulate himself on inventing the apprentice system, when a\npiercing scream brought both men to their feet. \u201cIt\u2019s Arnold,\u201d Banner\nsaid. \u201cArnold, you all right?\u201d\n\nHarcraft pushed Banner away from the speaker. \u201cArnold, what\u2019s wrong,\nyou O.K.?\u201d The speaker remained silent.\n\n\u201cYou better suit up,\u201d Banner said quietly.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harcraft said, staring dumbly at the speaker. \u201cYeah, I better\nsuit up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait. Better take a look on the viewscreen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, he\u2019s coming this way! Quick, get ready at the air lock!\u201d\n\nIt was fifteen minutes before they could get anything out of him, and\nthen he wasn\u2019t too coherent. They gave him an injection of herodine to\nquiet him down, but his eyes still rolled wildly and all he could\nmanage was: \u201cBig hunk of rock ... big hunk of rock ... rock, quick ...\nmonkey ships.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny idea what he\u2019s talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Banner said thoughtfully. \u201cThere was a sizable meteorite that\ncame pretty close while you were on your way back to the ship, but I\u2019d\nalready tracked it before either one of you went outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow close?\u201d\n\n\u201cHm-m-m. Visually, a dozen kilometers, I\u2019d guess. I could run the tape\nif you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVelocities almost the same?\u201d asked Harcraft, who was now fiddling with\nthe viewscreen controls.\n\n\u201cYeah. Shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find. How about lugging Bean Brain back\nto his bunk. I\u2019ll run the tape, then you can plot it on the screen.\u201d\n\nWhen Harcraft returned to the control cabin, Banner had already plotted\nit on the screen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say it\u2019s a big piece of rock! About four kilometers in diameter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but nothing out of order.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. Let me turn up the magnification a little and see if\u2014\u201d Banner\nwatched as Harcraft turned control buttons, skillfully increasing\nmagnification without losing the held of view. Suddenly, the object\nexploded into iridescence. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWatch,\u201d Harcraft said. He bumped the magnification as much as he\ndared.\n\n\u201cThe Ankorbadian fleet,\u201d said Banner between clenched teeth.\n\nThey spent the next hour scanning the ship\u2019s micro-library for anything\nat all on Ankorbadian religious practices. There was nothing. Arnold\nawoke in another hour and seemed remarkably free of hysteria.\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about our friends\u2019 religious holiday?\u201d asked Banner.\n\u201cWe checked the library without any luck.\u201d\n\nArnold scratched the side of his face. \u201cLemme think. Yeah, I remember.\nThey go home to celebrate spring, like you said.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey all go home?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. They got to. Only time they can mate. Only place, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long they stay? I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s about one of our months, but we\nhave to know exactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I know. Read it some place a long time ago. Can I go back\nto sleep now?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo back to sleep,\u201d said Banner.\n\nThey spent the next three hours maneuvering carefully around the\nasteroid. They took six thousand feet of movies and stared at the\nprojections for another three hours. One thousand seven hundred and\nthirty silvery needles flashed reflected starlight into astonished,\nwild eyes.\n\n\u201cAt least,\u201d whispered Banner, \u201cthere\u2019s nobody there.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of good that does us. They\u2019ll be back from their home planet in\na few weeks, just as soon as the breeding season is over. Why should\nthey leave anybody here? There\u2019s not a map in the galaxy that indicates\nthe position of this piece of rock. And we haven\u2019t any weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose the computer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compute an orbit without at least one more reference point.\nBesides, we\u2019re four weeks from any kind of fleet contact.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat. In other words, they\u2019ll be back here, ready to roll before we\ncan even tell anybody that we don\u2019t know how to find it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. And since there\u2019s not any room left to park another ship of\nthat size, it\u2019s a pretty safe assumption that they are ready to roll.\u201d\n\n\u201cArmageddon,\u201d muttered Harcraft.\n\n\u201cYou sure we don\u2019t have anything to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWeapons? Yeah. We have a pistol and three small nitro paks in a locker\nsome place. You couldn\u2019t even blow your way inside one of those ships.\nAnd if you could, you\u2019d spend two weeks and then blow yourself to hell\nbefore you\u2019d know anything about the armament.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K., let\u2019s land and look around. Go get Arnold.\u201d\n\n\nThey cut off the sleds and plunged down, landing between two of the\nships. Before putting on suits, Banner sent Arnold to the locker to get\nthe three nitro paks. He hoped it would help him overcome the terrible\nfeeling of nakedness and impotence.\n\nThey spent only a little time out of the ship. There was nothing to see\nthat hadn\u2019t been seen before, and the heavy artificial gravity\ngenerated by the alien ships\u2014coupled with a maze of deep crevices\u2014made\nwalking difficult and dangerous.\n\nBack in the control cabin, Banner turned to Harcraft, \u201cAny ideas?\u201d\n\n\u201cIdeas? You mean for saving Homo sapiens? I\u2019m afraid not. I simply do\nnot feel up to saving six billion sentient organisms today. I feel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting hysterical,\u201d said Banner, whose own tight, small voice\nwas barely audible.\n\n\u201cI got an opinion,\u201d said Arnold. \u201cYou guys stop crying for a minute and\nI\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nIt took him five minutes to explain the whole thing. When he was\nthrough, both Banner and Harcraft turned him down flat. \u201cNot a chance,\u201d\nsaid Banner. It would take a week to set the thing up, and then it\nwouldn\u2019t work. Our best chance is a long one, but maybe we\u2019ll make it.\nWe\u2019re four weeks away from any fleet contact, but it\u2019s the only\nsensible course of action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat makes it a total of eight weeks, with four weeks to get back\nhere. That\u2019s two months,\u201d said Arnold. \u201cYou think they\u2019re gonna wait\ntwo months before they shove out of here?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Banner said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the only thing to do. And the\nsooner we get started the better the chances. Let\u2019s get going.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look here\u2014\u201d Arnold began.\n\n\u201cNo more opinions, Bean Brain. You\u2019re not entitled to an opinion. You\nthink we should take your word for everything you told us? Tell me why.\nYou said yourself you never had any training. So you\u2019re guessing and\nhoping. It would take a staff of two dozen highly specialized\ntechnicians to even evaluate your idea, much less put it into action.\nHell, man, face it. What do you know about geology, chemistry, mining?\nWhat do you know about anything?\u201d\n\nArnold pointed a trembling finger at Banner. \u201cLook, I told you that I\nknow rock. I know plenty of gardening, too. I gave you guys a chance to\nsay O.K. You still say no? Have it your way, but we\u2019ll do it my way.\u201d\nBoth Banner and Harcraft found themselves staring into the barrel of\nthe ship\u2019s only weapon.\n\nHarcraft recovered from his astonishment quicker than Banner. \u201cO.K.,\nBean Brain, have it your way.\u201d Quickly, casually he started for the\ncabin door. Then, with such speed that Banner hardly saw the movement,\nhe chopped down viciously toward Arnold\u2019s wrist with the edge of his\nhand.\n\nHarcraft recovered consciousness a half hour later. \u201cDon\u2019t try that\nagain, little boy,\u201d said Arnold with unconcealed hatred. \u201cI\u2019ll give you\nanother thirty minutes to catch your breath. Then we all go to work.\u201d\n\nIt took ten days instead of seven. Under Arnold\u2019s close supervision,\nthey made the ship perform like a tractor, an air hammer, a foundation\nborer and an angledozer.\n\nOnce, when they told him that some particular maneuver couldn\u2019t be\ndone, he took the controls himself, and came so close to killing them\nall that Banner, out of sheer terror, took over and made it do the\nthings Arnold decreed necessary.\n\nFinally it was finished. Two million tons of potato fertilizer, one\nmillion tons of tractor fuel combined into a slimy pulp lay jammed into\nthe largest crevice on the asteroid. A few hours later they were a\nthousand miles out in space.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d asked Banner.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Arnold.\n\nWith the viewscreen at maximum magnification, they watched as the\nasteroid blew itself into a thousand million pieces.\n\n\nIn the control cabin, a short week away from fleet contact, Banner was\nstill gloating over the movies. \u201cLook at these. Before and After. How\nmany medals you think we can carry on our strong, manly chests?\u201d\n\n\u201cI really couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d answered Harcraft. \u201cWhile you\u2019ve been\nsitting there enriching your fantasy life, I\u2019ve solved the mystery of\nmysteries.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K. While our little friend has been lying on his bunk ruining his\nbeady eyes on the micro-viewer, I\u2019ve been asking myself significant\nquestions. Question number one: What kind of person does it take to\nsurvive the inactivity and boredom of three, four, maybe six months in\na space can like this? Answer: It takes a highly trained and\nconditioned person such as yours truly or yourself. Arnold is obviously\nnot such a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuestion number two: Under what circumstances can a person as\nobviously intelligent as Arnold manage not to become a highly\nspecialized member of society? And last, what kind of person can be so\nrevoltingly unspecialized as to know, with fanatical certainty, that\nthe main ingredient of a good potato fertilizer is ammonium nitrate;\nthat such a substance is rather ineffective as an explosive unless you\nmix it with a good oxidizable material, such as Diesel fuel; that a\nfour-square mile chunk of rock is \u2018brittle\u2019\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to add another nice facet\u2014that he\u2019s a lot cleverer in\nthe manly art of self-defense than you\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI acknowledge my humiliation and at the same time repeat my question:\nWhat kind of person can be so unspecialized and at the same time so\nmiserably competent?\u201d\n\n\u201cI give up. Do you really know the answer?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this. I know that whoever he is, it makes good sense to send\nsomebody like him along with two overspecialized robots like us. Look\nat us. You couldn\u2019t pull a cotter pin with a pair of pliers if you knew\nwhat a cotter pin was. As for myself, if I\u2019d of gotten that gun away\nfrom Arnold, I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019d have known how to fire it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich still doesn\u2019t answer any questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are still a hundred places on our primitive homeland that\nprovide the answer,\u201d said Harcraft thoughtfully. \u201cPlaces where men\nspend half the year working with vegetables and fertilizer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the other half breaking rock with a sledge hammer?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. And there\u2019s probably no better place than a cell to train for the\nisolation of space.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. It also explains a certain familiarity with makeshift\nexplosives and weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, brother Bean Brain,\u201d summed up Harcraft wistfully. \u201cWhat better\nplace in the universe to find asylum from specialization.\u201d\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n",
