    "body": "Anders lay on his bed, fully dressed except for his shoes and black bow\ntie, contemplating, with a certain uneasiness, the evening before him.\nIn twenty minutes he would pick up Judy at her apartment, and that was\nthe uneasy part of it.\n\nHe had realized, only seconds ago, that he was in love with her.\n\nWell, he'd tell her. The evening would be memorable. He would propose,\nthere would be kisses, and the seal of acceptance would, figuratively\nspeaking, be stamped across his forehead.\n\nNot too pleasant an outlook, he decided. It really would be much more\ncomfortable not to be in love. What had done it? A look, a touch, a\nthought? It didn't take much, he knew, and stretched his arms for a\nthorough yawn.\n\n\"Help me!\" a voice said.\n\nHis muscles spasmed, cutting off the yawn in mid-moment. He sat upright\non the bed, then grinned and lay back again.\n\n\"You must help me!\" the voice insisted.\n\nAnders sat up, reached for a polished shoe and fitted it on, giving his\nfull attention to the tying of the laces.\n\n\"Can you hear me?\" the voice asked. \"You can, can't you?\"\n\nThat did it. \"Yes, I can hear you,\" Anders said, still in a high good\nhumor. \"Don't tell me you're my guilty subconscious, attacking me for a\nchildhood trauma I never bothered to resolve. I suppose you want me to\njoin a monastery.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" the voice said. \"I'm no one's\nsubconscious. I'm _me_. Will you help me?\"\n\nAnders believed in voices as much as anyone; that is, he didn't believe\nin them at all, until he heard them. Swiftly he catalogued the\npossibilities. Schizophrenia was the best answer, of course, and one in\nwhich his colleagues would concur. But Anders had a lamentable\nconfidence in his own sanity. In which case--\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" the voice answered.\n\nAnders realized that the voice was speaking within his own mind. Very\nsuspicious.\n\n\"You don't know who you are,\" Anders stated. \"Very well. _Where_ are\nyou?\"\n\n\"I don't know that, either.\" The voice paused, and went on. \"Look, I\nknow how ridiculous this must sound. Believe me, I'm in some sort of\nlimbo. I don't know how I got here or who I am, but I want desperately\nto get out. Will you help me?\"\n\n\n\nStill fighting the idea of a voice speaking within his head, Anders knew\nthat his next decision was vital. He had to accept--or reject--his own\nsanity.\n\nHe accepted it.\n\n\"All right,\" Anders said, lacing the other shoe. \"I'll grant that you're\na person in trouble, and that you're in some sort of telepathic contact\nwith me. Is there anything else you can tell me?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" the voice said, with infinite sadness. \"You'll have to\nfind out for yourself.\"\n\n\"Can you contact anyone else?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then how can you talk with me?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nAnders walked to his bureau mirror and adjusted his black bow tie,\nwhistling softly under his breath. Having just discovered that he was in\nlove, he wasn't going to let a little thing like a voice in his mind\ndisturb him.\n\n\"I really don't see how I can be of any help,\" Anders said, brushing a\nbit of lint from his jacket. \"You don't know where you are, and there\ndon't seem to be any distinguishing landmarks. How am I to find you?\" He\nturned and looked around the room to see if he had forgotten anything.\n\n\"I'll know when you're close,\" the voice said. \"You were warm just\nthen.\"\n\n\"Just then?\" All he had done was look around the room. He did so again,\nturning his head slowly. Then it happened.\n\nThe room, from one angle, looked different. It was suddenly a mixture of\nmuddled colors, instead of the carefully blended pastel shades he had\nselected. The lines of wall, floor and ceiling were strangely off\nproportion, zigzag, unrelated.\n\nThen everything went back to normal.\n\n\"You were _very_ warm,\" the voice said. \"It's a question of seeing\nthings correctly.\"\n\nAnders resisted the urge to scratch his head, for fear of disarranging\nhis carefully combed hair. What he had seen wasn't so strange. Everyone\nsees one or two things in his life that make him doubt his normality,\ndoubt sanity, doubt his very existence. For a moment the orderly\nUniverse is disarranged and the fabric of belief is ripped.\n\nBut the moment passes.\n\nAnders remembered once, as a boy, awakening in his room in the middle of\nthe night. How strange everything had looked. Chairs, table, all out of\nproportion, swollen in the dark. The ceiling pressing down, as in a\ndream.\n\nBut that had also passed.\n\n\"Well, old man,\" he said, \"if I get warm again, let me know.\"\n\n\"I will,\" the voice in his head whispered. \"I'm sure you'll find me.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're so sure,\" Anders said gaily, switched off the lights\nand left.\n\n\n\nLovely and smiling, Judy greeted him at the door. Looking at her, Anders\nsensed her knowledge of the moment. Had she felt the change in him, or\npredicted it? Or was love making him grin like an idiot?\n\n\"Would you like a before-party drink?\" she asked.\n\nHe nodded, and she led him across the room, to the improbable\ngreen-and-yellow couch. Sitting down, Anders decided he would tell her\nwhen she came back with the drink. No use in putting off the fatal\nmoment. A lemming in love, he told himself.\n\n\"You're getting warm again,\" the voice said.\n\nHe had almost forgotten his invisible friend. Or fiend, as the case\ncould well be. What would Judy say if she knew he was hearing voices?\nLittle things like that, he reminded himself, often break up the best of\nromances.\n\n\"Here,\" she said, handing him a drink.\n\nStill smiling, he noticed. The number two smile--to a prospective\nsuitor, provocative and understanding. It had been preceded, in\ntheir relationship, by the number one nice-girl smile, the\ndon't-misunderstand-me smile, to be worn on all occasions, until\nthe correct words have been mumbled.\n\n\"That's right,\" the voice said. \"It's in how you look at things.\"\n\nLook at what? Anders glanced at Judy, annoyed at his thoughts. If he was\ngoing to play the lover, let him play it. Even through the astigmatic\nhaze of love, he was able to appreciate her blue-gray eyes, her fine\nskin (if one overlooked a tiny blemish on the left temple), her lips,\nslightly reshaped by lipstick.\n\n\"How did your classes go today?\" she asked.\n\nWell, of course she'd ask that, Anders thought. Love is marking time.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Teaching psychology to young apes--\"\n\n\"Oh, come now!\"\n\n\"Warmer,\" the voice said.\n\nWhat's the matter with me, Anders wondered. She really is a lovely girl.\nThe _gestalt_ that is Judy, a pattern of thoughts, expressions,\nmovements, making up the girl I--\n\nI what?\n\nLove?\n\nAnders shifted his long body uncertainly on the couch. He didn't quite\nunderstand how this train of thought had begun. It annoyed him. The\nanalytical young instructor was better off in the classroom. Couldn't\nscience wait until 9:10 in the morning?\n\n\"I was thinking about you today,\" Judy said, and Anders knew that she\nhad sensed the change in his mood.\n\n\"Do you see?\" the voice asked him. \"You're getting much better at it.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything,\" Anders thought, but the voice was right. It was\nas though he had a clear line of inspection into Judy's mind. Her\nfeelings were nakedly apparent to him, as meaningless as his room had\nbeen in that flash of undistorted thought.\n\n\"I really was thinking about you,\" she repeated.\n\n\"Now look,\" the voice said.\n\n\n\nAnders, watching the expressions on Judy's face, felt the strangeness\ndescend on him. He was back in the nightmare perception of that moment\nin his room. This time it was as though he were watching a machine in a\nlaboratory. The object of this operation was the evocation and\npreservation of a particular mood. The machine goes through a searching\nprocess, invoking trains of ideas to achieve the desired end.\n\n\"Oh, were you?\" he asked, amazed at his new perspective.\n\n\"Yes ... I wondered what you were doing at noon,\" the reactive machine\nopposite him on the couch said, expanding its shapely chest slightly.\n\n\"Good,\" the voice said, commending him for his perception.\n\n\"Dreaming of you, of course,\" he said to the flesh-clad skeleton behind\nthe total _gestalt_ Judy. The flesh machine rearranged its limbs,\nwidened its mouth to denote pleasure. The mechanism searched through a\ncomplex of fears, hopes, worries, through half-remembrances of analogous\nsituations, analogous solutions.\n\nAnd this was what he loved. Anders saw too clearly and hated himself for\nseeing. Through his new nightmare perception, the absurdity of the\nentire room struck him.\n\n\"Were you really?\" the articulating skeleton asked him.\n\n\"You're coming closer,\" the voice whispered.\n\nTo what? The personality? There was no such thing. There was no true\ncohesion, no depth, nothing except a web of surface reactions, stretched\nacross automatic visceral movements.\n\nHe was coming closer to the truth.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said sourly.\n\nThe machine stirred, searching for a response.\n\nAnders felt a quick tremor of fear at the sheer alien quality of his\nviewpoint. His sense of formalism had been sloughed off, his agreed-upon\nreactions bypassed. What would be revealed next?\n\nHe was seeing clearly, he realized, as perhaps no man had ever seen\nbefore. It was an oddly exhilarating thought.\n\nBut could he still return to normality?\n\n\"Can I get you a drink?\" the reaction machine asked.\n\nAt that moment Anders was as thoroughly out of love as a man could be.\nViewing one's intended as a depersonalized, sexless piece of machinery\nis not especially conducive to love. But it is quite stimulating,\nintellectually.\n\nAnders didn't want normality. A curtain was being raised and he wanted\nto see behind it. What was it some Russian scientist--Ouspensky, wasn't\nit--had said?\n\n\"_Think in other categories._\"\n\nThat was what he was doing, and would continue to do.\n\n\"Good-by,\" he said suddenly.\n\nThe machine watched him, open-mouthed, as he walked out the door.\nDelayed circuit reactions kept it silent until it heard the elevator\ndoor close.\n\n\n\n\"You were very warm in there,\" the voice within his head whispered, once\nhe was on the street. \"But you still don't understand everything.\"\n\n\"Tell me, then,\" Anders said, marveling a little at his equanimity. In\nan hour he had bridged the gap to a completely different viewpoint, yet\nit seemed perfectly natural.\n\n\"I can't,\" the voice said. \"You must find it yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, let's see now,\" Anders began. He looked around at the masses of\nmasonry, the convention of streets cutting through the architectural\npiles. \"Human life,\" he said, \"is a series of conventions. When you look\nat a girl, you're supposed to see--a pattern, not the underlying\nformlessness.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" the voice agreed, but with a shade of doubt.\n\n\"Basically, there is no form. Man produces _gestalts_, and cuts form out\nof the plethora of nothingness. It's like looking at a set of lines and\nsaying that they represent a figure. We look at a mass of material,\nextract it from the background and say it's a man. But in truth there is\nno such thing. There are only the humanizing features that\nwe--myopically--attach to it. Matter is conjoined, a matter of\nviewpoint.\"\n\n\"You're not seeing it now,\" said the voice.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Anders said. He was certain that he was on the track of\nsomething big, perhaps something ultimate. \"Everyone's had the\nexperience. At some time in his life, everyone looks at a familiar\nobject and can't make any sense out of it. Momentarily, the _gestalt_\nfails, but the true moment of sight passes. The mind reverts to the\nsuperimposed pattern. Normalcy continues.\"\n\nThe voice was silent. Anders walked on, through the _gestalt_ city.\n\n\"There's something else, isn't there?\" Anders asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWhat could that be, he asked himself. Through clearing eyes, Anders\nlooked at the formality he had called his world.\n\nHe wondered momentarily if he would have come to this if the voice\nhadn't guided him. Yes, he decided after a few moments, it was\ninevitable.\n\nBut who was the voice? And what had he left out?\n\n\"Let's see what a party looks like now,\" he said to the voice.\n\n\n\nThe party was a masquerade; the guests were all wearing their faces. To\nAnders, their motives, individually and collectively, were painfully\napparent. Then his vision began to clear further.\n\nHe saw that the people weren't truly individual. They were discontinuous\nlumps of flesh sharing a common vocabulary, yet not even truly\ndiscontinuous.\n\nThe lumps of flesh were a part of the decoration of the room and almost\nindistinguishable from it. They were one with the lights, which lent\ntheir tiny vision. They were joined to the sounds they made, a few\nfeeble tones out of the great possibility of sound. They blended into\nthe walls.\n\nThe kaleidoscopic view came so fast that Anders had trouble sorting his\nnew impressions. He knew now that these people existed only as patterns,\non the same basis as the sounds they made and the things they thought\nthey saw.\n\n_Gestalts_, sifted out of the vast, unbearable real world.\n\n\"Where's Judy?\" a discontinuous lump of flesh asked him. This particular\nlump possessed enough nervous mannerisms to convince the other lumps of\nhis reality. He wore a loud tie as further evidence.\n\n\"She's sick,\" Anders said. The flesh quivered into an instant sympathy.\nLines of formal mirth shifted to formal woe.\n\n\"Hope it isn't anything serious,\" the vocal flesh remarked.\n\n\"You're warmer,\" the voice said to Anders.\n\nAnders looked at the object in front of him.\n\n\"She hasn't long to live,\" he stated.\n\nThe flesh quivered. Stomach and intestines contracted in sympathetic\nfear. Eyes distended, mouth quivered.\n\nThe loud tie remained the same.\n\n\"My God! You don't mean it!\"\n\n\"What are you?\" Anders asked quietly.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" the indignant flesh attached to the tie demanded.\nSerene within its reality, it gaped at Anders. Its mouth twitched,\nundeniable proof that it was real and sufficient. \"You're drunk,\" it\nsneered.\n\nAnders laughed and left the party.\n\n\n\n\"There is still something you don't know,\" the voice said. \"But you were\nhot! I could feel you near me.\"\n\n\"What are you?\" Anders asked again.\n\n\"I don't know,\" the voice admitted. \"I am a person. I am I. I am\ntrapped.\"\n\n\"So are we all,\" Anders said. He walked on asphalt, surrounded by heaps\nof concrete, silicates, aluminum and iron alloys. Shapeless, meaningless\nheaps that made up the _gestalt_ city.\n\nAnd then there were the imaginary lines of demarcation dividing city\nfrom city, the artificial boundaries of water and land.\n\nAll ridiculous.\n\n\"Give me a dime for some coffee, mister?\" something asked, a thing\nindistinguishable from any other thing.\n\n\"Old Bishop Berkeley would give a nonexistent dime to your nonexistent\npresence,\" Anders said gaily.\n\n\"I'm really in a bad way,\" the voice whined, and Anders perceived that\nit was no more than a series of modulated vibrations.\n\n\"Yes! Go on!\" the voice commanded.\n\n\"If you could spare me a quarter--\" the vibrations said, with a deep\npretense at meaning.\n\nNo, what was there behind the senseless patterns? Flesh, mass. What was\nthat? All made up of atoms.\n\n\"I'm really hungry,\" the intricately arranged atoms muttered.\n\nAll atoms. Conjoined. There were no true separations between atom and\natom. Flesh was stone, stone was light. Anders looked at the masses of\natoms that were pretending to solidity, meaning and reason.\n\n\"Can't you help me?\" a clump of atoms asked. But the clump was identical\nwith all the other atoms. Once you ignored the superimposed patterns,\nyou could see the atoms were random, scattered.\n\n\"I don't believe in you,\" Anders said.\n\nThe pile of atoms was gone.\n\n\"Yes!\" the voice cried. \"Yes!\"\n\n\"I don't believe in any of it,\" Anders said. After all, what was an\natom?\n\n\"Go on!\" the voice shouted. \"You're hot! Go on!\"\n\nWhat was an atom? An empty space surrounded by an empty space.\n\nAbsurd!\n\n\"Then it's all false!\" Anders said. And he was alone under the stars.\n\n\"That's right!\" the voice within his head screamed. \"Nothing!\"\n\nBut stars, Anders thought. How can one believe--\n\nThe stars disappeared. Anders was in a gray nothingness, a void. There\nwas nothing around him except shapeless gray.\n\nWhere was the voice?\n\nGone.\n\nAnders perceived the delusion behind the grayness, and then there was\nnothing at all.\n\nComplete nothingness, and himself within it.\n\n\n\nWhere was he? What did it mean? Anders' mind tried to add it up.\n\nImpossible. _That_ couldn't be true.\n\nAgain the score was tabulated, but Anders' mind couldn't accept the\ntotal. In desperation, the overloaded mind erased the figures,\neradicated the knowledge, erased itself.\n\n\"Where am I?\"\n\nIn nothingness. Alone.\n\nTrapped.\n\n\"Who am I?\"\n\nA voice.\n\nThe voice of Anders searched the nothingness, shouted, \"Is there anyone\nhere?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\nBut there was someone. All directions were the same, yet moving along\none he could make contact ... with someone. The voice of Anders reached\nback to someone who could save him, perhaps.\n\n\"Save me,\" the voice said to Anders, lying fully dressed on his bed,\nexcept for his shoes and black bow tie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
