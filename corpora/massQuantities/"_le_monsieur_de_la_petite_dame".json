She was\na little creature, with childishly large eyes, a low, white forehead,\nreddish-brown hair, and Greek nose and mouth.\n\n\u201cClearly,\u201d remarked the old lady in the box opposite, \u201cnot a\nFrenchwoman. Her youth is too girlish, and she has too petulant an air\nof indifference.\u201d\n\nThis old lady in the box opposite was that venerable and somewhat severe\naristocrat, Madame de Castro, and having gazed for a moment or so a\nlittle disapprovingly at the new arrival, she turned her glasses to the\nyoung beauty\u2019s companion and uttered an exclamation.\n\nIt was at Monsieur she was looking now. Monsieur had followed his wife\nclosely, bearing her fan and bouquet and wrap, and had silently seated\nhim self a little behind her and in the shadow.\n\n\u201c_Ciel!_\u201d cried Madame de Castro, \u201cwhat an ugly little man!\u201d\n\nIt was not an unnatural exclamation. Fate had not been so kind to the\nindividual referred to as she might have been--in fact she had been\ndefinitely cruel. He was small of figure, insignificant, dark, and wore\na patient sphynx-like air of gravity. He did not seem to speak or move,\nsimply sat in the shadow holding his wife\u2019s belongings, apparently\nalmost entirely unnoticed by her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know him at all,\u201d said Madame de Castro; \u201cthough that is not to\nbe wondered at, since I have exiled myself long enough to forget and be\nforgotten by half Paris. What is his name?\u201d\n\nThe gentleman at her side--a distinguished-looking old young man, with a\nsarcastic smile--began with the smile, and ended with a half laugh.\n\n\u201cThey call him,\u201d he replied, \u201cLe Monsieur de la petite Dame. His name is\nVillefort.\u201d\n\n\u201cLe Monsieur de la petite Dame,\u201d repeated Madame, testily. \u201cThat is\na title of new Paris--the Paris of your Americans and English. It is\nvillainously ill-bred.\u201d\n\nM. Renard\u2019s laugh receded into the smile again, and the smile became of\ndouble significance.\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d he acquiesced, \u201cbut it is also villainously apropos. Look for\nyourself.\u201d\n\nMadame did so, and her next query, after she had dropped her glass\nagain, was a sharp one.\n\n\u201cWho is she--the wife?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is what you are pleased to call one of our Americans! You know\nthe class,\u201d--with a little wave of the hand,--\u201crich, unconventional,\ncomfortable people, who live well and dress well, and have an\nincomprehensibly _na\u00efve_ way of going to impossible places and doing\nimpossible things by way of enjoyment. Our fair friend there, for\ninstance, has probably been round the world upon several occasions,\nand is familiar with a number of places and objects of note fearful\nto contemplate. They came here as tourists, and became fascinated with\nEuropean life. The most overwhelming punishment which could be inflicted\nupon that excellent woman, the mother, would be that she should be\ncompelled to return to her New York, or Philadelphia, or Boston,\nwhichsoever it may be.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumph!\u201d commented Madame. \u201cBut you have not told me the name.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame Villefort\u2019s? No, not yet. It was Trent--Mademoiselle Bertha\nTrent.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not twenty yet,\u201d said Madame, in a queer, grumbling tone. \u201cWhat\ndid she marry that man for?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod knows,\u201d replied M. Renard, not too devoutly, \u201cParis does not.\u201d\n\nFor some reason best known to herself, Madame de Castro looked angry.\nShe was a shrewd old person, with strong whims of her own, even at\nseventy. She quite glared at the pretty American from under her bushy\neyebrows.\n\n\u201cLe Monsieur de la petite Dame!\u201d she fumed. \u201cI tell you it is low--_low_\nto give a man such names.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d returned Renard, shrugging his shoulders, \u201cwe did not give it to\nhim. It was an awkward servant who dubbed him so at first. She was new\nto her position, and forgot his name, and being asked who had arrived,\nstumbled upon this _bon mot: \u2018Un monsieur, Madame--le monsieur de la\npetite dame,\u2019_--and, being repeated and tossed lightly from hand to\nhand, it has become at last an established witticism, albeit bandied\nunder breath.\u201d\n\nIt was characteristic of the august De Castro that during the remainder\nof the evening\u2019s entertainment she should occupy herself more with her\nneighbors than with the opera. She aroused M. Renard to a secret ecstasy\nof mirth by the sharp steadiness of her observation of the inmates of\nthe box opposite to them. She talked about them, too, in a tone not too\nwell modulated, criticising the beautifully dressed little woman,\nher hair, her eyes, her Greek nose and mouth, and, more than all, her\nindifferent expression and her manner of leaning upon the edge of her\nbox and staring at the stage as if she did not care for, and indeed\nscarcely saw, what was going on upon it.\n\n\u201cThat is the way with your American beauties,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have no\nrespect for things. Their people spoil them--their men especially.\nThey consider themselves privileged to act as their whims direct. They\nhave not the gentle timidity of Frenchwomen. What French girl would have\nthe _sang froid_ to sit in one of the best boxes of the Nouvelle Op\u00e9ra\nand regard, with an actual air of _ennui_, such a performance as this?\nShe does not hear a word that is sung.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we--do we hear?\u201d bantered M. Renard.\n\n\u201c_Pouf!_\u201d cried Madame. \u201cWe! We are world-dried and weather-beaten. We\nhave not a worm-eaten emotion between us. I am seventy, and you, who are\nthirty-five, are the elder of the two. Bah! At that girl\u2019s age I had\nthe heart of a dove.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that is long ago,\u201d murmured M. Renard, as if to himself. It\nwas quite human that he should slightly resent being classed with an\nunamiable grenadier of seventy.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d with considerable asperity. \u201cFifty years!\u201d Then, with harsh\nvoice and withered face melted suddenly into softness quite _na\u00efve, \u201cMon\nDieu!_\u201d she said, \u201cFifty years since Ars\u00e8ne whispered into my ear at my\nfirst opera, that he saw tears in my eyes!\u201d\n\nIt was at this instant that there appeared in the Villefort box a new\nfigure,--that of a dark, slight young man of graceful movements,--in\nfact, a young man of intensely striking appearance. M. Villefort rose\nto receive him with serious courtesy, but the pretty American was not so\ngracious. Not until he had seated himself at her side and spoken to her\ndid she turn her head and permit her eyes simply to rest upon his face.\n\nM. Renard smiled again.\n\n\u201cEnter,\u201d he remarked in a low tone,--\u201center M. Ralph Edmondstone, the\ncousin of Madame.\u201d\n\nHis companion asked no questions, but he proceeded, returning to his\nlight and airy tone:--\n\n\u201cM. Ralph Edmondstone is a genius,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is an artist, he is a\npoet, he is also a writer of subtile prose. His sonnets to Euphrasie--in\nthe day of Euphrasie--awakened the admiration of the sternest critics:\nthey were so tender, so full of purest fire! Some of the same critics\nalso could scarcely choose between these and his songs to Agl\u00e6 in\nher day, or Camille in hers. He is a young man of fine fancies, and\npossesses the amiable quality of being invariably passionately in\nearnest. As he was serious in his sentiments yesterday, so he will be\nto-morrow, so he is to-day.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo-day!\u201d echoed Madame de Castro. \u201cNonsense!\u201d\n\nMadame Villefort did not seem to talk much. It was M. Ralph Edmondstone\nwho conversed, and that, too, with so much of the charm of animation\nthat it was pleasurable even to be a mere looker-on.\n\nOne involuntarily strained one\u2019s ears to catch a sentence,--he was\nso eagerly absorbed, so full of rapid, gracefully unconscious and\nunconventional gesture.\n\n\u201cI wonder what he is saying?\u201d Madame de Castro was once betrayed into\nexclaiming.\n\n\u201cSomething metaphysical, about a poem, or a passage of music, or a\npicture,--or perhaps his soul,\u201d returned M. Renard. \u201cHis soul is his\nstrong point,--he pets it and wonders at it. He puts it through its\npaces. And yet, singularly enough, he is never ridiculous--only fanciful\nand _na\u00efve_. It is his soul which so fascinates women.\u201d\n\nWhether this last was true of other women or not, Madame Villefort\nscarcely appeared fascinated. As she listened, her eyes still rested\nupon his eager mobile face, but with a peculiar expression,--an\nexpression of critical attention, and yet one which somehow detracted\nfrom her look of youth, as if she weighed his words as they fell from\nhis lips and classified them, without any touch of the enthusiasm which\nstirred within himself.\n\nSuddenly she rose from her seat ana addressed her husband, who\nimmediately rose also. Then she spoke to M. Edmondstone, and without\nmore ado, the three left the box,--the young beauty, a little oddly,\nrather followed than accompanied by her companions,--at the recognition\nof which circumstance Madame de Castro uttered a series of sharp\nejaculations of disapproval.\n\n\u201cBah! Bah!\u201d she cried. \u201cShe is too young for such airs!--as if she were\nMadame l\u2019Imp\u00e9ratrice herself! Take me to my carriage. I am tired also.\u201d\n\nCrossing the pavement with M. Renard, they passed the carriage of the\nVilleforts. Before its open door stood M. Villefort and Edmondstone, and\nthe younger man, with bared head, bent forward speaking to his cousin.\n\n\u201cIf I come to-morrow,\u201d he was saying, \u201cyou will be at home, Bertha?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, good-night,\u201d--holding out his hand,--\u201conly I wish so that\nyou would go to the Aylmers instead of home. That _prot\u00e9g\u00e9e_ of Mrs.\nAylmer\u2019s--the little singing girl--would touch your heart with her\nvoice. On hearing her, one thinks at once of some shy wild bird high in\na clear sky,--far enough above earth to have forgotten to be timid.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d came quietly from the darkness within the carriage; \u201cbut I am too\ntired to care about voices just now. Good-night, Ralph!\u201d\n\nM. Renard\u2019s reply of \u201cGod knows, Paris does not,\u201d to Madame de Castro\u2019s\nquery as to why Madame Villefort had married her husband, contained an\nelement of truth, and yet there were numbers of Parisian-Americans, more\nespecially the young, well-looking, and masculine, who at the time\nthe marriage had taken place had been ready enough with sardonic\nexplanations.\n\n\u201cThere are women who are avaricious enough to sell their souls,\u201d they\ncried; \u201cand the maternal Trent is one of them. The girl is only to blame\nfor allowing herself to be bullied into the match.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the weak place in this argument,\u201d said M. Renard, \u201cis, that the\npeople are too rich to be greatly influenced by money. If there had been\na title,--but there was no title.\u201d\n\nNeither did Bertha Trent comport herself like a cowed creature. She took\nher place in society as Madame Villefort in such a manner as could give\nrise to no comment whatever; only one or two of the restless inquisitive\nwondered if they had not been, mistaken in her. She was, as I have said\nalready, a childishly small and slight creature,--the kind of woman to\ntouch one with suggestions of helplessness and lack of will; and yet,\nnotwithstanding this, a celebrated artist--a shrewd, worldly-wise old\nfellow--who had painted her portrait, had complained that he was not\nsatisfied with it because he had not done justice to \u201cthe obstinate\nendurance in her eye.\u201d\n\nIt was to her cousin, Ralph Edmondstone, he had said this with some\ndegree of testiness, and Edmondstone had smiled and answered:--\n\n\u201cWhat! have you found that out? Few people do.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the marriage Edmondstone had been in Rome singeing his\nwings in the light of the eyes of a certain Marchesa who was his latest\npoetic passion. She was not his first fancy, nor would she be his last,\nbut she had power enough for the time being to have satisfied the most\nexacting of women.\n\nHe was at his banker\u2019s when he heard the news spoken of as the latest\nitem from American Paris, and his start and exclamation of disgust drew\nforth some cynical after-comment from men who envied him.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d he said, with indiscreet impatience. \u201cThat undersized sphynx of a\nVillefort? Faugh!\u201d\n\nBut insignificant though he might be, it was M. Villefort who had\nwon, and if he was nothing more, he was at least a faithful attendant.\nHenceforth, those who saw his wife invariably saw him also,--driving\nwith her in her carriage, riding with her courageously if ungracefully,\nstanding or seated near her in the shadow of her box at the Nouvelle\nOp\u00e9ra, silent, impassive, grave, noticeable only through the contrast he\nafforded to her girlish beauty and bloom.\n\n\u201cAlways there!\u201d commented a sharp American belle of mature years, \u201clike\nan ugly little conscience.\u201d\n\nEdmondstone\u2019s first meeting with his cousin after his return to Paris\nwas accidental. He had rather put off visiting her, and one night,\nentering a crowded room, he found himself standing behind a girl\u2019s light\nfigure and staring at an abundance of reddish-brown hair. When, almost\nimmediately the pretty head to which this hair belonged turned with\na slow, yet involuntary-looking movement toward him, he felt that he\nbecame excited without knowing why.\n\n\u201cAh, Bertha!\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nShe smiled a little and held out her hand, and he immediately became\nconscious of M. Villefort being quite near and regarding him seriously.\n\nIt was the perverseness of fate that he should find in Bertha Villefort\neven more than he had once seen in Bertha Trent, and there had been\na time when he had seen a great deal in Bertha Trent. In the Trent\nhousehold he had been a great favorite. No social evening or family\nfestivity had seemed complete without his presence. The very children\nhad felt that they had a claim upon his good-humor, and his tendency\nto break forth into whimsical frolic. Good Mrs. Trent had been wont to\nscold him and gossip with him. He had read his sonnets and metaphysical\narticles to Bertha, and occasionally to the rest; in fact, his footing\nin the family was familiar and firmly established. But since her\nmarriage Bertha had become a little incomprehensible, and on that\naccount a little more interesting. He was sure she had developed, but\ncould not make out in what direction. He found occasion to reproach her\nsometimes with the changes he found in her.\n\n\u201cThere are times when I hardly know you,\u201d he would say, \u201cyou are so\nfinely orthodox and well controlled. It was not so with you once,\nBertha. Don\u2019t--don\u2019t become that terrible thing, a fine lady, and worse\nstill, a fine lady who is _d\u00e9sillusion\u00e9e_\u201d\n\nIt baffled him that she never appeared much moved, by his charges.\nCertainly she lived the life of a \u201cfine lady,\u201d--a brilliant life,\na luxurious one, a life full of polite dissipation. Once, when in a\ntenderly fraternal mood, he reproached her with this also, she laughed\nat him frankly.\n\n\u201cIt is absinthe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is my absinthe at least, and who does\nnot drink a little absinthe--of one kind or another?\u201d\n\nHe was sincerely convinced that from this moment he understood and had\nthe right to pity and watch over her. He went oftener to see her. In her\npresence he studied her closely, absent he brooded over her. He became\nimpatiently intolerant of M. Villefort, and prone to condemn him, he\nscarcely knew for what.\n\n\u201cHe has no dignity--no perception,\u201d was his parental decision. \u201cHe has\nnot even the delicacy to love her, or he would have the tenderness to\nsacrifice his own feelings and leave her to herself. I could do it for a\nwoman I loved.\u201d\n\nBut M. Villefort was always there,--gravely carrying the shawls, picking\nup handkerchiefs, and making himself useful.\n\n\u201c_Imb\u00e9cile!_\u201d muttered M. Renard under cover of his smile and his\nmustache, as he stood near his venerable patroness the first time she\nmet the Villeforts.\n\n\u201cBlockhead!\u201d stealthily ejaculated that amiable aristocrat. But though\nshe looked grimly at M. Villefort, M. Renard was uncomfortably uncertain\nthat it was he to whom she referred.\n\n\u201cGo and bring them to me,\u201d she commanded, \u201cGo and bring them to me\nbefore some one else engages them. I want to talk to that girl.\u201d\n\nIt was astonishing how agreeable she made herself to her victims\nwhen she had fairly entrapped them. Bertha hesitated a little before\naccepting her offer of a seat at her side, but once seated she found\nherself oddly amused. When Madame de Castro chose to rake the embers of\nher seventy years, many a lively coal discovered itself among the ashes.\n\nSeeing the two women together, Edmondstone shuddered in fastidious\nprotest.\n\n\u201cHow could you laugh at that detestable old woman?\u201d he exclaimed on\nencountering Bertha later in the evening. \u201cI wonder that M. Villefort\nwould permit her to talk to you. She is a wicked, cynical creature, who\nhas the hardihood to laugh at her sins instead of repenting of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps that is the reason she is so amusing,\u201d said Bertha.\n\nEdmondstone answered her with gentle mournfulness.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d he said. \u201cHave you begun to say such things? You too, Bertha\u201d--\n\nThe laugh with which she stopped him was both light and hard.\n\n\u201cWhere is M. Villefort?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have actually not seen him for\nfifteen minutes. Is it possible that Madame de Castro has fascinated him\ninto forgetting me?\u201d\n\nEdmondstone went to his hotel that night in a melancholy mood. He even\nlay awake to think what a dreary mistake his cousin\u2019s marriage was. She\nhad been such a tender and easily swayed little soul as a girl, and now\nit really seemed as if she was hardening into a woman of the world.\nIn the old times he had been wont to try his sonnets upon Bertha as a\nmusician tries his chords upon his most delicate instrument. Even now\nhe remembered certain fine, sensitive expressions of hers which had\nthrilled him beyond measure.\n\n\u201cHow could she marry such a fellow as that--how could she?\u201d he groaned.\n\u201cWhat does it mean? It must mean something.\u201d\n\nHe was pale and heavy-eyed when he wandered round to the Villeforts\u2019\nthe following morning. M. Villefort was sitting with Bertha and reading\naloud. He stopped to receive their visitor punctiliously and inquire\nafter his health.\n\n\u201cM. Edmondstone cannot have slept well,\u201d he remarked.\n\n\u201cI did not sleep at all,\u201d Edmondstone answered, \u201cand naturally have a\nheadache.\u201d\n\nBertha pointed to a wide lounge of the _pouf_ order.\n\n\u201cThen go to sleep now,\u201d she said; \u201cM. Villefort will read. When I have a\nheadache he often reads me to sleep, and I am always better on awaking.\u201d\n\nInvoluntarily Edmondstone half frowned. Absurdly enough, he resented in\nsecret this amiability on the part of M. Villefort toward his own wife.\nHe was quite prepared to be severe upon the reading, but was surprised\nto be compelled to acknowledge that M. Villefort read wondrously well,\nand positively with hints of delicate perception. His voice was full and\nyet subtly flexible. Edmondstone tried to protest against this also, but\nuselessly. Finally he was soothed, and from being fretfully wide-awake\nsuddenly passed into sleep as Bertha had commanded. How long his slumber\nlasted he could not have told. All at once he found himself aroused and\nwide-awake as ever. His headache had departed; his every sense seemed to\nhave gained keenness. M. Villefort\u2019s voice had ceased, and for a few\nseconds utter, dead silence reigned. Then he heard the fire crackling,\nand shortly afterward a strange, startling sound--a sharp, gasping sob!\n\nThe pang which seized upon him was strong indeed. In one moment he\nseemed to learn a thousand things by intuition--to comprehend her,\nhimself, the past. Before he moved he knew that Villefort was not in the\nroom, and he had caught a side glimpse of the pretty blue of Bertha\u2019s\ndress.\n\nBut he had not imagined the face he saw when he turned his head to look\nat her. She sat in a rigid attitude, leaning against the high cushioned\nback of her chair, her hands clasped above her head. She stared at the\nfire with eyes wide and strained with the agony of tears unshed, and\namid the rush of all other emotions he was peculiarly conscious of\nbeing touched by the minor one of his recognition of her look of extreme\nyouth--the look which had been wont to touch people in the girl, Bertha\nTrent. He had meant to speak clearly, but his voice was only a loud\nwhisper when he sprang up, uttering her name.\n\n\u201cBertha! Bertha! Bertha!\u201d as he flung himself upon his knees at her\nside.\n\nHer answer was an actual cry, and yet it reached no higher pitch than\nhis own intense whisper.\n\n\u201cI thought you were asleep?\u201d\n\nHer hands fell and he caught them. His sad impassioned face bowed itself\nupon her palms.\n\n\u201cI am awake, Bertha,\u201d he groaned. \u201cI am awake--at last.\u201d\n\nShe regarded him with a piteous, pitying glance. She knew him with a\nkeener, sadder knowledge than he would ever comprehend; but she did not\nunder-estimate the depth of his misery at this one overwhelming moment.\nHe was awake indeed and saw what he had lost.\n\n\u201cIf you could but have borne with me a little longer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\nhad only not been so shallow and so blind. If you could but have borne\nwith me a little longer!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I could but have borne with myself a little longer,\u201d she answered.\n\u201cIf I could but have borne a little longer with my poor, base pride!\nBecause I suffered myself, I have made another suffer too.\u201d\n\nHe knew she spoke of M. Villefort, and the thought jarred upon him.\n\n\u201cHe does not suffer,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is not of the fibre to feel pain.\u201d\n\nAnd he wondered why she shrank from him a little and answered with a sad\nbitterness:--\n\n\u201cAre you sure? You did not know that!\u201d--\n\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said brokenly, the face he lifted, haggard with his\nunhappiness. \u201cForgive me, for I have lost so much.\u201d\n\nShe wasted few words and no tears. The force and suddenness of his\nemotion and her own had overborne her into this strange unmeant\nconfession; but her mood was unlike his,--it was merely receptive. She\nlistened to his unavailing regrets, but told him little of her own past.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter,\u201d she said drearily. \u201cIt is all over. Let it\nrest. The pain of to-day and tomorrow is enough for us. We have borne\nyesterday; why should we want it back again?\u201d\n\nAnd when they parted she said only one thing of the future:--\n\n\u201cThere is no need that we should talk. There is nothing for us beyond\nthis point. We can only go back. We must try to forget--and be satisfied\nwith our absinthe.\u201d\n\nInstead of returning to his hotel, Edmondstone found his way to the\nChamps \u00c9lys\u00e9es, and finally to the Bois. He was too wretched to have any\npurpose in his wanderings. He walked rapidly, looking straight before\nhim and seeing nobody. He scarcely understood his own fierce emotions\nHitherto his fancies had brought him a vague rapture; now he experienced\nabsolute anguish, Every past experience had become trivial. What\nhappiness is so keen as one\u2019s briefest pain? As he walked he lived again\nthe days he had thrown away. He remembered a thousand old, yet new,\nphases of Bertha\u2019s girlhood. He thought of times when she had touched\nor irritated or pleased him. When he had left Paris for Rome she had not\nbidden him good-by. Jenny, her younger sister, had told him that she was\nnot well.\n\n\u201cIf I had seen her then,\u201d he cried inwardly, \u201cI might have read her\nheart--and my own.\u201d\n\nM. Renard, riding a very tall horse in the Bois, passed him and raised\nhis eyebrows at the sight of his pallor and his fagged yet excited look.\n\n\u201cThere will be a new sonnet,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cA sonnet to Despair,\nor Melancholy, or Loss.\u201d\n\nAfterward, when society became a little restive and eager, M. Renard\nlooked on with sardonic interest.\n\n\u201cThat happy man, M. Villefort,\u201d he said to Madame de Castro, \u201cis a good\nsoul--a good soul. He has no small jealous follies,\u201d and his smile was\nscarcely a pleasant thing to see.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing for us beyond this past,\u201d Bertha had said, and\nEdmondstone had agreed with her hopelessly.\n\nBut he could not quite break away. Sometimes for a week the Villeforts\nmissed him, and then again they saw him every day. He spent his mornings\nwith them, joined them in their drives, at their opera-box, or at the\nentertainments of their friends. He also fell into his old place in the\nTrent household, and listened with a vague effort at interest to Mrs.\nTrent\u2019s maternal gossip about the boys\u2019 college expenses, Bertha\u2019s\nhousehold, and Jenny\u2019s approaching social _d\u00e9but_ He was continually\nfull of a feverish longing to hear of Bertha,--to hear her name spoken,\nher ingoings and out-comings discussed, her looks, her belongings.\n\n\u201cThe fact is,\u201d said Mrs. Trent, as the winter advanced, \u201cI am anxious\nabout Bertha. She does not look strong. I don\u2019t know why I have not\nseen it before, but all at once I found out yesterday that she is really\nthin. She was always slight and even a little fragile, but now she is\nactually thin. One can see the little bones in her wrists and fingers.\nHer rings and her bracelets slip about quite loosely.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd talking of being thin, mother,\u201d cried Jenny, who was a frank,\nbright sixteen-year-old, \u201clook at cousin Ralph himself. He has little\nhollows in his cheeks, and his eyes are as much too big as Bertha\u2019s. Is\nthe sword wearing out the scabbard, Ralph? That is what they always say\nabout geniuses, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cRalph has not looked well for some time,\u201d said Mrs. Trent. \u201cAs for\nBertha, I think I shall scold her a little, and M. Villefort too. She\nhas been living too exciting a life. She is out continually. She must\nstay at home more and rest. It is rest she needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you tell Arthur that Bertha looks ill \u201c--began Jenny.\n\nEdmondstone turned toward her sharply. \u201cArthur!\u201d he repeated. \u201cWho is\nArthur?\u201d\n\nMrs. Trent answered with a comfortable laugh.\n\n\u201cIt is M. Villefort\u2019s name,\u201d she said, \u201cthough none of us call him\nArthur but Jenny. Jenny and he are great friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like him better than any one else,\u201d said Jenny stoutly. \u201cAnd I wish\nto set a good example to Bertha, who never calls him anything but M.\nVillefort, which is absurd. Just as if they had been introduced to each\nother about a week ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always hear him address her as Madame Villefort,\u201d reflected\nEdmondstone, somewhat gloomily.\n\n\u201cOh yes!\u201d answered Jenny, \u201cthat is his French way of studying her\nfancies. He would consider it taking an unpardonable liberty to call her\n\u2018Bertha,\u2019 since she only favors him with \u2018M. Villefort.\u2019 I said to him\nonly the other day, \u2018Arthur, you are the oddest couple! You\u2019re so grand\nand well-behaved, I cannot imagine you scolding Bertha a little, and\nI have never seen you kiss her since you were married.\u2019 I was half\nfrightened after I had said it. He started as if he had been shot,\nand turned as pale as death. I really felt as if I had done something\nfrightfully improper.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe French are so different from the Americans,\u201d said Mrs. Trent,\n\u201cparticularly those of M. Villefort\u2019s class. They are beautifully\npunctilious, but I don\u2019t call it quite comfortable, you know.\u201d\n\nHer mother was not the only person who noticed a change in Bertha\nVillefort. Before long it was a change so marked that all who saw her\nobserved it. She had become painfully frail and slight. Her face looked\ntoo finely cut, her eyes had shadowy hollows under them, and were always\nbright with a feverish excitement.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter with your wife?\u201d demanded Madame de Castro of M.\nVillefort. Since their first meeting she had never loosened her hold\nupon the husband and wife, and had particularly cultivated Bertha.\n\nThere was no change in the expression of M. Villefort, but he was\nstrangely pallid as he made his reply.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible for me to explain, Madame.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is absolutely attenuated,\u201d cried Madame\u00bb \u201cShe is like a spirit.\nTake her to the country--to Normandy--to the sea--somewhere! She will\ndie if there is not a change. At twenty, one should be as plump as a\nyoung capon.\u201d\n\nA few days after this, Jenny Trent ran in upon Bertha as she lay upon\na lounge, holding an open book, but with closed eyes. She had come to\nspend the morning, she announced. She wanted to talk--about people,\nabout her dress, about her first ball which was to come off shortly.\n\n\u201cAnd Arthur says\u201d--she began.\n\nBertha turned her head almost as Edmondstone had done.\n\n\u201cArthur!\u201d she repeated. For the second time Jenny felt a little\nembarrassed.\n\n\u201cI mean M. Villefort,\u201d she said, hesitantly.\n\nShe quite forgot what she had been going to say, and for a moment or so\nregarded the fire quite gravely. But naturally this could not last long.\nShe soon began to talk again, and it was not many minutes before she\nfound M. Villefort in her path once more.\n\n\u201cI never thought I could like a Frenchman so much,\u201d she said, in all\nenthusiastic good faith. \u201cAt first, you know,\u201d with an apologetic half\nlaugh, \u201cI wondered why you had not taken an American instead, when there\nwere so many to choose from, but now I understand it. What beautiful\ntender things he can say, Bertha, and yet not seem in the least\nsentimental. Everything comes so simply right from the bottom of his\nheart. Just think what he said to me yesterday when he brought me those\nflowers. He helps me with mine, and it is odd how things will cheer up\nand grow for him, I said to him, \u2018Arthur, how is it that no flower ever\nfails you?\u2019 and he answered in the gentlest quiet way, \u2018Perhaps because\nI never fail them. Flowers are like people,--one must love and be\ntrue to them, not only to-day and to-morrow, but every day--every\nhour--always.\u2019 And he says such things so often. That is why I am so\nfond of him.\u201d\n\nAs she received no reply, she turned toward the lounge. Bertha lay upon\nit motionless and silent,--only a large tear trembled on her cheek.\nJenny sprung up, shocked and checked, and went to\u2019 her.\n\n\u201cOh, Bertha!\u201d she cried, \u201chow thoughtless I am to tire you so, you poor\nlittle soul! Is it true that you are so weak as all that? I heard mamma\nand Arthur talking about it, but I scarcely believed it. They said you\nmust go to Normandy and be nursed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to Normandy,\u201d said Bertha, \u201cI--I am too tired. I\nonly want to lie still and rest. I have been out too much.\u201d\n\nHer voice, however, was so softly weak that in the most natural manner\nJenny was subdued into shedding a few tears also, and kissed her\nfervently.\n\n\u201cOh, Bertha!\u201d she said, \u201cyou must do anything--anything that will\nmake you well--if it is only for Arthur\u2019s sake. He loves you so--so\nterribly.\u201d\n\nWhereupon Bertha laughed a little hysterically. \u201cDoes he,\u201d she said,\n\u201clove me so \u2018terribly\u2019? Poor M. Villefort?\u201d\n\nShe did not go to Normandy, however, and still went into society, though\nnot as much as had been her habit. When she spent her evenings at home,\nsome of her own family generally spent them with her, and M. Villefort\nor Edmondstone read aloud or talked.\n\nIn fact, Edmondstone came oftener than ever. His anxiety and unhappiness\ngrew upon him, and made him moody, irritable, and morbid.\n\nOne night, when M. Villefort had left them alone together for a short\ntime, he sprang from his chair and came to her couch, shaken with\nsuppressed emotion.\n\n\u201cThat man is killing you!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou are dying by inches! I\ncannot bear it!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not _he_ who is killing me,\u201d she answered; and then M. Villefort\nreturned to the room with the book he had been in search of.\n\nIn this case Edmondstone\u2019s passion took new phases. He wrote no sonnets,\npainted no pictures. He neglected his work, and spent his idle hours in\nrambling here and there in a gloomy, unsociable fashion.\n\n\u201cHe looks,\u201d said M. Renard, \u201cas if his soul had been playing him some\nevil trick.\u201d\n\nHe had at first complained that Bertha had taken a capricious fancy\nto Madame de Castro, but in course of time he found his way to the old\nwoman\u2019s _salon_ too, though it must be confessed that Madame herself\nnever showed him any great favor. But this he did not care for. He only\ncared to sit in the same room with Bertha, and watch her every movement\nwith a miserable tenderness.\n\nOne night, after regarding him cynically for some time, Madame broke out\nto Bertha with small ceremony:--\n\n\u201cWhat a fool that young man is!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cHe sits and fairly\ndevours you with his eyes. It is bad taste to show such an insane\npassion for a married woman.\u201d\n\nIt seemed as if Bertha lost at once her breath and every drop of blood\nin her body, for she had neither breath nor color when she turned and\nlooked Madame de Castro in the face.\n\n\u201cMadame,\u201d she said, \u201cif you repeat that to me, you will never see me\nagain--never!\u201d\n\nUpon which Madame snapped her up with some anger at being so rebuked for\nher frankness.\n\n\u201cThen it is worse than I thought,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was weeks before she saw her young friend again. Indeed, it required\nsome clever diplomacy to heal the breach made, and even in her most\namusing and affectionate moods, she often felt afterward that she was\ntreated with a reserve which held her at arm\u2019s length.\n\nBy the time the horse-chestnuts bloomed pink and white on the Avenue des\nChamps \u00c9lys\u00e9es, there were few people in the Trent and Villefort circles\nwho had not their opinions on the subject of Madame Villefort and her\ncousin.\n\nThere was a mixture of French and American gossip and comment, frank\nsatire, or secret remark. But to her credit be it spoken, Madame de\nCastro held grim silence, and checked a rumor occasionally with such\namiable ferocity as was not without its good effect.\n\nThe pink and white blossoms were already beginning to strew themselves\nat the feet of the pedestrians, when one morning M. Villefort presented\nhimself to Madame, and discovered her sitting alone in the strangest of\nmoods.\n\n\u201cI thought I might have the pleasure of driving home with Madame\nVillefort. My servant informed me that I should find her here.\u201d\n\nMadame de Castro pointed to a chair.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d she commanded.\n\nM. Villefort obeyed her in some secret but well-concealed amazement.\nHe saw that she was under the influence of some unusual excitement. Her\nfalse front was pushed fantastically away, her rouge and powder were\nrubbed off in patches, her face looked set and hard. Her first words\nwere abominably blunt.\n\n\u201cM. Villefort,\u201d she said, \u201cdo you know what your acquaintances call\nyou?\u201d\n\nA deep red rose slowly to his face, but he did not answer.\n\n\u201cDo you know that you are designated by them by an absurd title--that\nthey call you in ridicule \u2018Le Monsieur de la petite Dame?\u2019 Do you know\nthat?\u201d\n\nHis look was incomprehensible, but he bowed gravely.\n\n\u201cMadame,\u201d he answered, \u201csince others have heard the title so often, it\nis but natural that I myself should have heard it more than once.\u201d\n\nShe regarded him in angry amazement. She was even roused to rapping upon\nthe floor with her gold-headed cane.\n\n\u201cDoes it not affect you?\u201d she cried. \u201cDoes it not move you to\nindignation?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat, Madame,\u201d he replied, \u201ccan only be my affair. My friends will\nallow me my emotions at least.\u201d\n\nThen she left her chair and began to walk up and down, striking the\ncarpet hard with her cane at every step.\n\n\u201cYou are a strange man,\u201d she remarked.\n\nSuddenly, however, when just on the point of starting upon a fresh tour,\nshe wheeled about and addressed him sharply.\n\n\u201cI respect you,\u201d she said; \u201cand because I respect you, I will do you a\ngood turn.\u201d\n\nShe made no pretense at endeavoring to soften the blow she was about to\nbestow. She drew forth from her dress a letter, the mere sight of which\nseemed to goad her to a mysterious excitement.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d she cried; \u201cit was M. Ralph Edmondstone who wrote this,--it was\nto Madame Villefort it was written. It means ruin and dishonor. I offer\nit to you to read.\u201d\n\nM. Villefort rose and laid his hand upon his chair to steady himself.\n\n\u201cMadame,\u201d he answered, \u201cI will not touch it.\u201d\n\nShe struck herself upon her withered breast.\n\n\u201cBehold me!\u201d she said. \u201c_Me!_ I am seventy years old! Good God! seventy!\nI am a bad old woman, and it is said I do not repent of my sins. I, too,\nhave been a beautiful young girl. I, too, had my first lover. I, too,\nmarried a man who had not won my heart. It does not matter that the\nhusband was worthy and the lover was not,--one learns that too late. My\nfate was what your wife\u2019s will be if you will not sacrifice your pride\nand save her.\u201d\n\n\u201cPride!\u201d he echoed in a bitter, hollow voice. \u201cMy pride, Madame!\u201d\n\nShe went on without noticing him:--\n\n\u201cThey have been here this morning--both of them. He followed her, as he\nalways does. He had a desperate look which warned me. Afterward I found\nthe note upon the floor. Now will you read it?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood God!\u201d he cried, as he fell into his chair again, his brow sinking\ninto his hands.\n\n\u201cI have read it,\u201d said Madame, with a tragic gesture, \u201cand I choose to\nplace one stumbling-block in the path that would lead her to an old age\nlike mine. I do not like your Americans; but I have sometimes seen in\nher girl\u2019s face a proud, heroic endurance of the misery she has brought\nupon herself, and it has moved me. And this let ter--you should read it,\nto see how such a man can plead. It is a passionate cry of despair--it\nis a poem in itself. I, myself, read it with sobs in my throat and tears\nin my eyes. \u2018If you love me!--if you have ever loved me!\u2019 he cries, \u2018for\nGod\u2019s sake!--for love\u2019s sake!--if there is love on earth--if there is a\nGod in heaven, you will not let me implore you in vain!\u2019 And his prayer\nis that she will leave Paris with him tonight--. to-night! There!\nMonsieur, I have done. Behold the letter! Take it or leave it, as you\nplease.\u201d And she flung it upon the floor at his feet.\n\nShe paused a moment, wondering what he would do.\n\nHe bent down and picked the letter up.\n\n\u201cI will take it,\u201d he said.\n\nAll at once he had become calm, and when he rose and uttered his last\nwords to her, there was upon his face a faint smile.\n\n\u201cI, too,\u201d he said,--\u201cI, too, Madame, suffer from a mad and hopeless\npassion, and thus can comprehend the bitterness of M. Edmondstone\u2019s\npangs. I, too, would implore in the name of love and God,--if I might,\nbut I may not.\u201d And so he took his departure.\n\nUntil evening Bertha did not see him. The afternoon she spent alone and\nin writing letters, and having completed and sealed the last, she went\nto her couch and tried to sleep. One entering the room, as she lay upon\nthe violet cushions, her hands at her sides, her eyes closed, might well\nhave been shocked. Her spotless pallor, the fine sharpness of her face,\nthe shadows under her eyes, her motionlessness, would have excused\nthe momentary feeling. But she was up and dressed for dinner when M.\nVillefort presented himself. Spring though it was, she was attired in a\nhigh, close dress of black velvet, and he found her almost cowering over\nthe open fire-place. Strangely enough, too, she fancied that when she\nlooked up at him she saw him shiver, as if he were struck with a slight\nchill also.\n\n\u201cYou should not wear that,\u201d he said, with a half smile at her gown.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cIt makes you so white--so much like a too early lily. But--but perhaps\nyou thought of going out?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answered; \u201cnot to-night.\u201d\n\nHe came quite close to her.\n\n\u201cIf you are not too greatly fatigued,\u201d he said, \u201cit would give me\nhappiness to take you with me on my errand to your mother\u2019s house. I\nmust carry there my little birthday gift to your sister,\u201d smiling again.\n\nAn expression of embarrassment showed itself upon her face.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cto think that I had forgotten it! She will feel as\nif I did not care for her at all.\u201d\n\nShe seemed for the moment quite unhappy.\n\n\u201cLet me see what you have chosen.\u201d\n\nHe drew from his pocket a case and opened it.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she cried, \u201chow pretty and how suitable for a girl!\u201d\n\nThey were the prettiest, most airy set of pearls imaginable.\n\nShe sat and looked at them for a few seconds thoughtfully, and then\nhanded them back.\n\n\u201cYou are very good, and Jenny will be in ecstasies,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is a happiness to me to give her pleasure,\u201d he returned. \u201cI feel\ngreat tenderness for her. She is not like the young girls I have known.\nHer innocence is of a frank and noble quality, which is better than\nignorance. One could not bear that the slightest shadow of sin or pain\nshould fall upon her. The atmosphere surrounding her is so bright with\npure happiness and the courage of youth.\u201d\n\nInvoluntarily he held out his hand.\n\n\u201cWill you\u201d--he began. His voice fell and broke. \u201cWill you go with me?\u201d\n he ended.\n\nHe saw that she was troubled.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d she faltered.\n\n\u201cYes--now.\u201d\n\nThere was a peculiar pause,--a moment, as it seemed to him, of\nbreathless silence. This silence she broke by her rising slowly from her\nseat.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she responded, \u201cI will go. Why should I not?\u201d\n\nIt was midnight when they left the Trents\u2019, and Jenny stood upon the\nthreshold, a bright figure in a setting of brightness, and kissed her\nhand to them as they went down the steps.\n\n\u201cI hope you will be better to-morrow, Arthur,\u201d she said.\n\nHe turned quickly to look up at her.\n\n\u201cI?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. You look so tired. I might say haggard, if it was polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would not be polite,\u201d said Bertha, \u201cso don\u2019t say it. Good-night,\nJenny!\u201d\n\nBut when they were seated in the carriage she glanced at her husband\u2019s\nface.\n\n\u201c_Are_ you unwell?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe passed his hand quickly across his forehead.\n\n\u201cA little fatigued,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt is nothing. To-morrow--to-morrow it\nwill be all over.\u201d\n\nAnd so silence fell upon them.\n\nAs they entered the drawing-room a clock chimed the half hour.\n\n\u201cSo late as that!\u201d exclaimed Bertha, and sank into a chair with a faint\nlaugh. \u201cWhy, to-day is over,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is to-morrow.\u201d\n\nM. Villefort had approached a side table. Upon it lay a peculiar-looking\noblong box.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d he said, softly, \u201cthey have arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d Bertha asked.\n\nHe was bending over the box to open it, and did not turn toward her, as\nhe replied:--\n\n\u201cIt is a gift for a young friend of mine,--a brace of pistols. He has\nbefore him a long journey in the East, and he is young enough to have a\nfancy for firearms.\u201d\n\nHe was still examining the weapons when Bertha crossed the room on her\nway up-stairs, and she paused an instant to look at them.\n\n\u201cThey are very handsome,\u201d she said. \u201cOne could almost wear them as\nornaments.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they would have too threatening a look,\u201d he answered, lightly.\n\nAs he raised his eyes they met hers. She half started backward, moved by\na new sense of the haggardness of his face.\n\n\u201cYou _are_ ill!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou are as colorless as marble.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you, too,\u201d he returned, still with the same tender lightness. \u201cLet\nus hope that our \u2018to-morrow\u2019 will find us both better, and you say it is\ntomorrow now. Good-night!\u201d\n\nShe went away without saying more. Weary as she was, she knew there was\nno sleep for her, and after dismissing her maid, she threw herself upon\nthe lounge before the bedroom fire and lay there. To-night she felt as\nif her life had reached its climax. She burst into a passion of tears.\n\n\u201cJenny! Jenny!\u201d she cried, \u201chow I envy--how I envy you!\u201d\n\nThe recollection of Jenny shining in her pretty gala dress, and\ndelighting in her birthday presents, and everybody else\u2019s pride and\naffection, filled her with a morbid misery and terror. She covered her\nface with her hands as she thought of it.\n\n\u201cOnce,\u201d she panted, \u201cas I looked at her tonight, for a moment I almost\nhated her. Am I so bad as that?--am I?\u201d\n\nScarcely two seconds afterward she had sprung to her feet and was\nstanding by the side of her couch, her heart beating with a rapid throb\nof fright, her limbs trembling. A strange sound had fallen suddenly upon\nthe perfect silence of the night--a sound loud, hard, and sharp--the\nreport of a pistol! What dread seized her she knew not. She was across\nthe room and had wrenched the door open in an instant, then with flying\nfeet down the corridor and the staircase. But half-way down the stairs\nshe began to cry out aloud, \u201cArthur! Arthur!\u201d not conscious of her own\nvoice--\u201cArthur, what is it?\u201d The door of the drawing-room flew open\nbefore the fierce stroke of her palm.\n\nM. Villefort stood where she had left him; but while his left hand\nsupported his weight against the table, his right was thrust into his\nbreast. One of the pistols lay at his feet.\n\nShe thought it was Death\u2019s self that confronted her in his face, but he\nspoke to her, trying faintly to smile.\n\n\u201cDo not come in,\u201d he said, \u201cI have met with--an accident. It is nothing.\nDo not come in. A servant----\u201d\n\nHis last recollection was of her white face and white draperies as he\nfell, and somehow, dizzy, sick, and faint as he was, he seemed to hear\nher calling out, in a voice strangely like Jenny\u2019s, \u201cArthur! Arthur!\u201d\n\nIn less than half an hour the whole house was astir. Upstairs physicians\nwere with the wounded man, downstairs Mrs. Trent talked and wept\nover her daughter, after the manner of all good women. She was fairly\nterrified by Bertha\u2019s strange shudderings, quick, strained breath, and\ndilated eyes. She felt as if she could not reach her--as if she hardly\nmade herself heard.\n\n\u201cYou must calm yourself, Bertha,\u201d she would say. \u201cTry to calm yourself.\nWe must hope for the best. Oh, how could it have happened!\u201d\n\nIt was in the midst of this that a servant entered with a letter, which\nhe handed to his mistress. The envelope bore upon it nothing but her own\nname.\n\nShe looked at it with a bewildered expression.\n\n\u201cFor me?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt fell from Monsieur\u2019s pocket as we carried him upstairs,\u201d replied the\nman.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind it now, Bertha,\u201d said her mother, \u201cAh, poor M. Villefort!\u201d\n\nBut Bertha had opened it mechanically and was reading it\n\nAt first it seemed as if it must have been written in a language she did\nnot understand; but after the first few sentences a change appeared. Her\nbreath came and went more quickly than before--a kind of horror grew in\nher eyes. At the last she uttered a low, struggling cry. The paper\nwas crushed in her hand, she cast one glance around the room as if\nin bewildering search for refuge, and flung herself upon her mother\u2019s\nbreast.\n\n\u201cSave me, mother!\u201d she said. \u201cHelp me! If he dies now, I shall go mad!\u201d\n\nAfterward, in telling her story at home, good Mrs. Trent almost broke\ndown.\n\n\u201cOh, Jenny!\u201d she said. \u201cJust to think of the poor fellow\u2019s having had it\nin his pocket then! Of course I did not see it, but one can fancy that\nit was something kind and tender,--perhaps some little surprise he had\nplanned for her. It seemed as if she could not bear it.\u201d\n\nM. Villefort\u2019s accident was the subject of discussion for many days. He\nhad purchased a wonderful pair of pistols as a gift for a young friend.\nHow it had happened that one had been loaded none knew; it was just\npossible that he had been seized with the whim to load it himself--at\nall events, it had gone off in his hands. An inch--nay, half an inch--to\nthe right, and Madame Villefort, who flew downstairs at the sound of the\nreport, would only have found a dead man at her feet.\n\n\u201c_Ma foi!_\u201d said M. Renard, repressing his smile; \u201cthis is difficult for\nMonsieur, but it may leave \u2018_la petite Dame_\u2019 at liberty.\u201d\n\nMadame de Castro flew at him with flashing eyes.\n\n\u201cSilence!\u201d she said, \u201cif you would not have me strike you with my cane.\u201d\n And she looked as if she were capable of doing it.\n\nUpon his sick-bed M, Villefort was continually haunted by an\napparition--an apparition of a white face and white draperies, such\nas he had seen as he fell. Sometimes it was here, sometimes there,\nsometimes near him, and sometimes indistinct and far away. Sometimes he\ncalled out to it and tried to extend his arms; again he lay and watched,\nit murmuring gentle words, and smiling mournfully.\n\nMrs. Trent and the doctor were in despair. Madame Villefort obstinately\nrefused to be forced from her husband\u2019s room. There were times when they\nthought she might sink and die there herself. She would not even leave\nit when they obliged her to sleep. Having been slight and frail from\nill health before, she became absolutely attenuated. Soon all her beauty\nwould be gone.\n\n\u201cDo you know,\u201d said Mrs. Trent to her husband, \u201cI have found out that\nshe always carries that letter in her breast? I see her put her hand to\nit in the strangest way a dozen times a day.\u201d\n\nOne night, awakening from a long sleep to a clearer mental consciousness\nthan usual, M. Villefort found his apparition standing over him.\n\nShe stood with one hand clinched upon her breast, and she spoke to him.\n\n\u201cArthur!\u201d she said,--\u201cArthur, do you know me?\u201d\n\nHe answered her, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nShe slipped down upon her knees, and held up in her hand a letter\ncrushed and broken.\n\n\u201cTry to keep your mind clear while you listen to me,\u201d she implored.\n\u201cTry--try! I must tell you, or I shall die. I am not the bad woman you\nthink me. I never had read it--I had not seen it. I think he must have\nbeen mad. Once I loved him, but he killed my love himself. I could not\nhave been bad like that, Jenny!--mother!--Arthur! believe me! believe\nme!\u201d\n\nIn this supreme moment of her anguish and shame she forgot all else. She\nstretched forth her hands, panting.\n\n\u201cBelieve me! It is true! Try to understand! Some one is coming! Say one\nword before it is too late!\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand I believe.\u201d He made a weak effort to\ntouch her hand, but failed. He thought that perhaps it was the chill\nand numbness of death which stole over him and held him bound. When the\nnurse, whose footsteps they had heard, entered, she found him lying with\nglazed eyes, and Madame Villefort fallen in a swoon at the bedside.\n\nAnd yet, from this time forward the outside world began to hear that his\ncase was not so hopeless after all.\n\n\u201cVillefort will possibly recover,\u201d it was said at first; then,\n\u201cVillefort improves, it seems;\u201d and, at last, \u201cVillefort is out of\ndanger Who would have thought it?\u201d\n\nNobody, however, could say that Madame had kept pace with her husband.\nWhen Monsieur was sufficiently strong to travel, and was advised to\ndo so, there were grave doubts as to the propriety of his wife\u2019s\naccompanying him.\n\nBut she would not listen to those doubts.\n\n\u201cI will not stay in Paris,\u201d she said to her mother. \u201cI want to be free\nfrom it, and Jenny has promised to go with us.\u201d\n\nThey were to go into Normandy, and the day before their departure Ralph\nEdmondstone came to bid them good-bye.\n\nOf the three he was by far the most haggard figure, and when Bertha came\ndown to meet him in the empty drawing-room, he became a wretched figure\nwith a broken, hopeless air, For a few seconds Bertha did not speak,\nbut stood a pace or two away looking at him. It seemed, in truth, as she\nwaited there in her dark, nun-like dress, that nearly all her beauty had\nleft her. There remained only her large sad eyes and pretty hair, and\nthe touching look of extreme youth. In her hand she held the crushed\nletter.\n\n\u201cSee!\u201d she said at last, holding this out to him. \u201cI am not so bad--so\nbad as that.\u201d\n\nHe caught it from her hand and tore it into fragments. He was stabbed\nthrough and through with shame and remorse. After all, his love had been\nstrong enough here, and his comprehension keen enough to have made him\nrepent in the dust of the earth, in his first calm hour, the insult he\nhad put upon her.\n\n\u201cForgive me!\u201d he cried; \u201coh, forgive me!\u201d\n\nThe few steps between them might have been a myriad of miles.\n\n\u201cI did love you--long ago,\u201d she said; \u201cbut you never thought of me. You\ndid not understand me then--nor afterward. All this winter my love has\nbeen dying a hard death. You tried to keep it alive, but--you did not\nunderstand. You only humiliated and tortured me--And I knew that if I\nhad loved you more, you would have loved me less. See!\u201d holding up her\nthin hand, \u201cI have been worn out in the struggle between my unhappiness\nand remorse and you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not know what love is!\u201d he burst forth, stung into swift\nresentment.\n\nA quick sob broke from her.\n\n\u201cYes I do.\u201d she answered. \u201cI--I have seen it\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean M. Villefort!\u201d he cried in desperate jealous misery. \u201cYou\nthink that he----\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the scattered fragments of the letter.\n\n\u201cHe had that in his pocket when he fell,\u201d she said, \u201cHe thought that I\nhad read it. If I had been your wife, and you had thought so, would you\nhave thought that I was worth trying to save--as he tried to save me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d he exclaimed, shamefacedly. \u201cHas he seen it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answered, with another sob, which might have been an echo of\nthe first. \u201cAnd that is the worst of all.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, during which he looked down at the floor, and even\ntrembled a little.\n\n\u201cI have done you more wrong than I thought,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied; \u201ca thousand-fold more.\u201d\n\nIt seemed as if there might have been more to say, but it was not said.\n\nIn a little while he roused himself with an effort.\n\n\u201cI am not a villain!\u201d he said. \u201cI can do one thing. I can go to\nVillefort--if you care.\u201d\n\nShe did not speak. So he moved slowly away until he reached the door.\nWith his hand upon the handle he turned and looked back at her.\n\n\u201cOh, it is good-bye--good-bye!\u201d he almost groaned.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe could not help it--few men could have done so. His expression was\nalmost fierce as he spoke his next words.\n\n\u201cAnd you will love him--yes, you will love _him_.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, with bitter pain. \u201cI am not worthy.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nIt was a year or more before the Villeforts were seen in Paris again,\nand Jenny enjoyed her wanderings with them wondrously. In fact, she\nwas the leading member of the party. She took them where she chose,--to\nqueer places, to ugly places, to impossible places, but never from first\nto last to any place where there were not, or at least had not been,\nAmericans as absurdly erratic as themselves.\n\nThe winter before their return they were at Genoa, among other places;\nand it was at Genoa that one morning, on opening a drawer, Bertha came\nupon an oblong box, the sight of which made her start backward and put\nher hand to her beating side. M. Villefort approached her hurriedly. An\ninstant later, however, he started also and shut the drawer.\n\n\u201cCome away,\u201d he said, taking her hand gently. \u201cDo not remain here.\u201d\n\nBut he was pale, too, and his hand was unsteady. He led her to the\nwindow and made her sit down.\n\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d he said. \u201cI should not have left them there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not send them to your friend?\u201d she faltered.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nHe stood for a moment or so, and looked out of the window at the blue\nsea which melted into the blue sky, at the blue sky which bent itself\ninto the blue sea, at the white sails flecking the deep azure, at the\nwaves hurrying in to break upon the sand.\n\n\u201cThat\u201d--he said at length, tremulously, and with pale lips--\u201cthat was\nfalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas false!\u201d she echoed.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d hoarsely, \u201cit was false. There was no such friend. It was a\nlie--they were meant only for myself.\u201d\n\nShe uttered a low cry of anguish and dread.\n\n\u201cAh, _mon Dieu!_\u201d he said. \u201cYou could not know. I understood all, and\nhad been silent. I was nothing--a jest--\u2018_le Monsieur de la petite\nDame_,\u2019 as they said,--only that. I swore that I would save you. When I\nbade you adieu that night, I thought it was my last farewell. There was\nno accident. Yes--there was one. I did not die, as I had intended. My\nhand was not steady enough. And since then----\u201d\n\nShe rose up, crying out to him as she had done on that terrible night--\n\n\u201cArthur! Arthur!\u201d\n\nHe came closer to her.\n\n\u201cIs it true,\u201d he said,--\u201cis it true that my prayers have not been\nin vain? Is it true that at last--at last, you have learned--have\nlearned----\u201d\n\nShe stretched forth her arms to him.\n\n\u201cIt is true!\u201d she cried. \u201cYes, it is true!--it is true!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n",
