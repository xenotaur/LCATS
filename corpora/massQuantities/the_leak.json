    "body": "\"Really great criminals are never found out, for the simple reason that\nthe greatest crimes--their crimes--are never discovered,\" remarked\nProfessor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen positively. \"There is genius in\nthe perpetration of crime, Mr. Grayson, just as there must be in its\ndetection, unless it is the shallow work of a bungler. In this latter\ncase there have been instances where even the police have uncovered the\ntruth. But the expert criminal, the man of genius--the professional, I\nmay say--regards as perfect only that crime which does not and cannot be\nmade to appear a crime at all; therefore one that can never under any\ncircumstances involve him, or anyone else.\"\n\nThe financier, J. Morgan Grayson, regarded this wizened little man of\nscience--The Thinking Machine--thoughtfully, through the smoke of his\ncigar.\n\n\"It is a strange psychological fact that the casual criminal glories in\nhis crime beforehand, and from one to ten minutes afterward,\" The\nThinking Machine continued. \"For instance, the man who kills for revenge\nwants the world to know it is his work; but at the end of ten minutes\ncomes fear, and then paradoxically enough, he will seek to hide his\ncrime and protect himself. With fear comes panic, with panic\nirresponsibility, and then he makes the mistake--hews a pathway which\nthe trained mind follows from motive to a prison cell.\"\n\n\"These are the men who are found out. But there are men of genius, Mr.\nGrayson, professionally engaged in crime. We never hear of them because\nthey are never caught, and we never even suspect them because they make\nno mistake. Imagine the great brains of history turned to crime. Well,\nthere are today brains as great as any of those of history; there is\nmurder and theft and robbery under our noses that we never dream of. If\nI, for instance, should become an active criminal----\" He paused.\n\nGrayson, with a queer expression on his face, puffed steadily at his\ncigar.\n\n\"I could kill you now, here in this room,\" The Thinking Machine went on\ncalmly, \"and no one would ever know, never even suspect. Why? Because I\nwould make no mistake.\"\n\nIt was not a boast as he said it; it was merely a statement of fact.\nGrayson appeared to be a little startled. Where there had been only\nimpatient interest in his manner, there was now fascination.\n\n\"How would you kill me, for instance?\" he inquired curiously.\n\n\"With any one of a dozen poisons, with virulent germs, or even with a\nknife or revolver,\" replied the scientist placidly. \"You see, I know how\nto use poisons; I know how to inoculate with germs; I know how to\nproduce a suicidal appearance perfectly with either a revolver or knife.\nAnd I never make mistakes, Mr. Grayson. In the sciences we must be\nexact--not approximately so, but absolutely so. We must know. It isn't\nlike carpentry. A carpenter may make a trivial mistake in a joint, and\nit will not weaken his house; but if the scientist makes one mistake,\nthe whole structure tumbles down. We must know. Knowledge is progress.\nWe gain knowledge through observation and logic--inevitable logic. And\nlogic tells us that two and two make four--not sometimes but all the\ntime.\"\n\nGrayson flicked the ashes off his cigar thoughtfully, and little\nwrinkles appeared about his eyes as he stared into the drawn,\ninscrutable face of the scientist. The enormous, straw-yellow head was\ncushioned against the chair, the squinting, watery blue eyes turned\nupward, and the slender white fingers at rest, tip to tip. The financier\ndrew a long breath. \"I have been informed that you were a remarkable\nman,\" he said at last slowly. \"I believe it. Quinton Frazer, the banker\nwho gave me the letter of introduction to you, told me how you once\nsolved a remarkable mystery in which----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" interrupted the scientist shortly, \"the Ralston Bank\nburglary--I remember.\"\n\n\"So I came to you to enlist your aid in something which is more\ninexplicable than that,\" Grayson went on hesitatingly. \"I know that no\nfee I might offer would influence you; yet it is a case which----\"\n\n\"State it,\" interrupted The Thinking Machine again.\n\n\"It isn't a crime--that is, a crime that can be reached by law,\" Grayson\nhurried on, \"but it has cost me millions, and----\"\n\nFor one instant The Thinking Machine lowered his squint eyes to those of\nhis visitor, then raised them again. \"Millions!\" he repeated. \"How\nmany?\"\n\n\"Six, eight, perhaps ten,\" was the reply. \"Briefly, there is a leak in\nmy office. My plans become known to others almost by the time I have\nperfected them. My plans are large; I have millions at stake; and the\ngreatest secrecy is absolutely essential. For years I have been able to\npreserve this secrecy; but half a dozen times in the last eight weeks my\nplans have become known, and I have been caught. Unless you know the\nStreet, you can't imagine what a tremendous disadvantage it is to have\nsomeone know your next move to the minutest detail and, knowing it,\ndefeat you at every turn.\"\n\n\"No, I don't know your world of finance, Mr. Grayson,\" remarked The\nThinking Machine. \"Give me an instance.\"\n\n\"Well, take this last case,\" said the financier earnestly. \"Briefly,\nwithout technicalities, I had planned to unload the securities of the\nP., Q. & X. Railway, protecting myself through brokers, and force the\noutstanding stock down to a price where other brokers, acting for me,\ncould buy far below the actual value. In this way I intended to get\ncomplete control of the stock. But my plans became known, and when I\nbegan to unload everything was snapped up by the opposition, with the\nresult that instead of gaining control of the road I lost heavily. This\nsame thing has happened, with variations, half a dozen times.\"\n\n\"I presume that is strictly honest?\" inquired the scientist mildly.\n\n\"Honest?\" repeated Grayson. \"Certainly--of course.\"\n\n\"I shall not pretend to understand all that,\" said The Thinking Machine\ncurtly. \"It doesn't seem to matter, anyway. You want to know where the\nleak is. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Well, who is in your confidence?\"\n\n\"No one, except my stenographer.\"\n\n\"Who is he, please?\"\n\n\"It's a woman--Miss Evelyn Winthrop. She has been in my employ for six\nyears in the same capacity--more than five years before this leak\nappeared. I trust her absolutely.\"\n\n\"No man knows your business?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the financier grimly. \"I learned years ago that no one\ncould keep my secrets as well as I do--there are too many temptations.\nTherefore, I never mention my plans to anyone--never--to anyone!\"\n\n\"Except your stenographer,\" corrected the scientist.\n\n\"I work for days, weeks, sometimes months, perfecting plans, and it's\nall in my head, not on paper--not a scratch of it,\" explained Grayson.\n\"When I say that she is in my confidence, I mean that she knows my plans\nonly half an hour or less before the machinery is put into motion. For\ninstance, I planned this P., Q. & X. deal. My brokers didn't know of it;\nMiss Winthrop never heard of it until twenty minutes before the Stock\nExchange opened for business. Then I dictated to her, as I always do,\nsome short letters of instructions to my agents. That is all she knew of\nit.\"\n\n\"You outlined the plan in those letters?\"\n\n\"No; they merely told my brokers what to do.\"\n\n\"But a shrewd person, knowing the contents of all those letters, could\nhave learned what you intended to do?\"\n\n\"Yes; but no one person knew the contents of all the letters. No one\nbroker knew what was in the other letters. Miss Winthrop and I were the\nonly two human beings who knew all that was in them.\"\n\nThe Thinking Machine sat silent for so long that Grayson began to fidget\nin his chair. \"Who was in the room besides you and Miss Winthrop before\nthe letters were sent?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"No one,\" responded Grayson emphatically. \"For an hour before I dictated\nthose letters, until at least an hour afterward, after my plans had gone\nto smash, no one entered that room. Only she and I work there.\"\n\n\"But when she finished the letters, she went out?\" insisted The Thinking\nMachine.\n\n\"No,\" declared the financier, \"she didn't even leave her desk.\"\n\n\"Or perhaps sent something out--carbon copies of the letters?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Or called up a friend on the telephone?\" continued The Thinking Machine\nquietly.\n\n\"Nor that,\" retorted Grayson.\n\n\"Or signaled to someone through the window?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the financier again. \"She finished the letters, then remained\nquietly at her desk, reading a book. She hardly moved for two hours.\"\n\nThe Thinking Machine lowered his eyes and glared straight into those of\nthe financier. \"Someone listened at the window?\" he went on after a\nmoment.\n\n\"No. It is sixteen stories up, fronting the street, and there is no fire\nescape.\"\n\n\"Or the door?\"\n\n\"If you knew the arrangement of my offices, you would see how utterly\nimpossible that would be, because--\"\n\n\"Nothing is impossible, Mr. Grayson,\" snapped the scientist abruptly.\n\"It might be improbable, but not impossible. Don't say that--it annoys\nme exceedingly.\" He was silent for a moment. Grayson stared at him\nblankly. \"Did either you or she answer a call on the 'phone?\"\n\n\"No one called; we called no one.\"\n\n\"Any apertures--holes or cracks--in your flooring or walls or ceilings?\"\ndemanded the scientist.\n\n\"Private detectives whom I had employed looked for such an opening, and\nthere was none,\" replied Grayson.\n\nAgain The Thinking Machine was silent for a long time. Grayson lighted a\nfresh cigar and settled back in his chair patiently. Faint cobwebby\nlines began to appear on the dome-like brow of the scientist, and slowly\nthe squint eyes were narrowing.\n\n\"The letters you wrote were intercepted?\" he suggested at last.\n\n\"No,\" exclaimed Grayson flatly. \"Those letters were sent direct to the\nbrokers by a dozen different methods, and every one of them had been\ndelivered by five minutes of ten o'clock, when 'Change begins business.\nThe last one left me at ten minutes of ten.\"\n\n\"Dear me! Dear me!\" The Thinking Machine rose and paced the length of\nthe room.\n\n\"You don't give me credit for the extraordinary precautions I have\ntaken, particularly in this last P., Q. & X. deal,\" Grayson continued.\n\"I left positively nothing undone to insure absolute secrecy. And Miss\nWinthrop, I know, is innocent of any connection with the affair. The\nprivate detectives suspected her at first, as you do, and she was\nwatched in and out of my office for weeks. When she was not under my\neyes, she was under the eyes of men to whom I had promised an\nextravagant sum of money if they found the leak. She didn't know it\nthen, and doesn't know it now. I am heartily ashamed of it all, because\nthe investigation proved her absolute loyalty to me. On this last day\nshe was directly under my eyes for two hours; and she didn't make one\nmovement that I didn't note, because the thing meant millions to me.\nThat proved beyond all question that it was no fault of hers. What could\nI do?\"\n\nThe Thinking Machine didn't say. He paused at a window, and for minute\nafter minute stood motionless there, with eyes narrowed to mere slits.\n\n\"I was on the point of discharging Miss Winthrop,\" the financier went\non, \"but her innocence was so thoroughly proved to me by this last\naffair that it would have been unjust, and so----\"\n\nSuddenly the scientist turned upon his visitor. \"Do you talk in your\nsleep?\" he demanded.\n\n\"No,\" was the prompt reply. \"I had thought of that too. It is beyond all\nordinary things, Professor. Yet there is a leak that is costing me\nmillions.\"\n\n\"It comes down to this, Mr. Grayson,\" The Thinking Machine informed him\ncrabbedly. \"If only you and Miss Winthrop knew those plans, and no one\nelse, and they did leak, and were not deduced from other things, then\neither you or she permitted them to leak, intentionally or\nunintentionally. That is as pure logic as two and two make four; there\nis no need to argue it.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, I didn't,\" said Grayson.\n\n\"Then Miss Winthrop did,\" declared The Thinking Machine finally,\npositively; \"unless we credit the opposition, as you call it, with\ntelepathic gifts hitherto unheard of. By the way, you have referred to\nthe other side only as the opposition. Do the same men, the same clique,\nappear against you all the time, or is it only one man?\"\n\n\"It's a clique,\" explained the financier, \"with millions back of it,\nheaded by Ralph Matthews, a young man to whom I give credit for being\nthe prime factor against me.\" His lips were set sternly.\n\n\"Why?\" demanded the scientist.\n\n\"Because every time he sees me he grins,\" was the reply. Grayson seemed\nsuddenly discomfited.\n\nThe Thinking Machine went to a desk, addressed an envelope, folded a\nsheet of paper, placed it inside, then sealed it. At length he turned\nback to his visitor. \"Is Miss Winthrop at your office now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Let us go there, then.\"\n\nA few minutes later the eminent financier ushered the eminent scientist\ninto his private office on the Street. The only person there was a young\nwoman--a woman of twenty-six or-seven, perhaps--who turned, saw Grayson,\nand resumed reading. The financier motioned to a seat. Instead of\nsitting, however, The Thinking Machine went straight to Miss Winthrop\nand extended a sealed envelop to her.\n\n\"Mr. Ralph Matthews asked me to hand you this,\" he said.\n\nThe young woman glanced up into his face frankly, yet with a certain\ntimidity, took the envelope, and turned it curiously in her hand.\n\n\"Mr. Ralph Matthews,\" she repeated, as if the name was a strange one. \"I\ndon't think I know him.\"\n\nThe Thinking Machine stood staring at her aggressively, as she opened\nthe envelope and drew out the sheet of paper. There was no expression\nsave surprise--bewilderment, rather--to be read on her face.\n\n\"Why, it's a blank sheet!\" she remarked, puzzled.\n\nThe scientist turned suddenly toward Grayson, who had witnessed the\nincident with frank astonishment in his eyes. \"Your telephone a moment,\nplease,\" he requested.\n\n\"Certainly; here,\" replied Grayson.\n\n\"This will do,\" remarked the scientist.\n\nHe leaned forward over the desk where Miss Winthrop sat, still gazing at\nhim in a sort of bewilderment, picked up the receiver, and held it to\nhis ear. A few moments later he was talking to Hutchinson Hatch,\nreporter.\n\n\"I merely wanted to ask you to meet me at my apartment in an hour,\" said\nthe scientist. \"It is very important.\"\n\nThat was all. He hung up the receiver, paused for a moment to admire an\nexquisitely wrought silver box--a \"vanity\" box--on Miss Winthrop's desk,\nbeside the telephone, then took a seat beside Grayson and began to\ndiscourse almost pleasantly upon the prevailing meteorological\nconditions. Grayson merely stared; Miss Winthrop continued her reading.\n\n\n\nProfessor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen, distinguished scientist, and\nHutchinson Hatch, newspaper reporter, were poking round among the\nchimney pots and other obstructions on the roof of a skyscraper. Far\nbelow them the slumber-enshrouded city was spread out like a panorama,\nstreets dotted brilliantly with lights, and roofs hazily visible through\nmists of night. Above, the infinite blackness hung like a veil, with\nstarpoints breaking through here and there.\n\n\"Here are the wires,\" Hatch said at last, and he stooped.\n\nThe Thinking Machine knelt on the roof beside him, and for several\nminutes they remained thus in the darkness, with only the glow of a\nflashlight to indicate their presence. Finally, The Thinking Machine\nrose.\n\n\"That's the wire you want, Mr. Hatch,\" he said. \"I'll leave the rest of\nit to you.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" asked the reporter.\n\n\"I am always sure,\" was the tart response.\n\nHatch opened a small handsatchel and removed several queerly wrought\ntools. These he spread on the roof beside him; then, kneeling again,\nbegan his work. For half an hour he labored in the gloom, with only the\nflashlight to aid him, and then he rose.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he said.\n\nThe Thinking Machine examined the work that had been done, grunted his\nsatisfaction, and together they went to the skylight, leaving a thin,\ninsulated wire behind them, stringing along to mark their path. They\npassed down through the roof and into the darkness of the hall of the\nupper story. Here the light was extinguished. From far below came the\nfaint echo of a man's footsteps as the watchman passed through the\nsilent, deserted building.\n\n\"Be careful!\" warned The Thinking Machine.\n\nThey went along the hall to a room in the rear, and still the wire\ntrailed behind. At the last door they stopped. The Thinking Machine\nfumbled with some keys, then opened the way. Here an electric light was\non. The room was bare of furniture, the only sign of recent occupancy\nbeing a telephone instrument on the wall.\n\nHere The Thinking Machine stopped and stared at the spool of wire which\nhe had permitted to wind off as he walked, and his thin face expressed\ndoubt.\n\n\"It wouldn't be safe,\" he said at last, \"to leave the wire exposed as we\nhave left it. True, this floor is not occupied; but someone might pass\nthis way and disturb it. You take the spool, go back to the roof,\nwinding the wire as you go, then swing the spool down to me over the\nside of the building, so that I can bring it in through the window. That\nwill be best. I will catch it here, and thus there will be nothing to\nindicate any connection.\" Hatch went out quietly and closed the door.\n\n\n\nTwice the following day The Thinking Machine spoke to the financier over\nthe telephone. Grayson was in his private office, Miss Winthrop at her\ndesk, when the first call came.\n\n\"Be careful in answering my questions,\" warned The Thinking Machine when\nGrayson answered. \"Do you know how long Miss Winthrop has owned the\nlittle silver box which is now on her desk, near the telephone?\"\n\nGrayson glanced round involuntarily to where the girl sat idly turning\nover the leaves of her book. \"Yes,\" he answered, \"for seven months. I\ngave it to her last Christmas.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the scientist. \"That simplifies matters. Where did you\nbuy it?\"\n\nGrayson mentioned the name of a well-known jeweler.\n\nConsiderably later in the day The Thinking Machine called Grayson to the\ntelephone again.\n\n\"What make of typewriter does she use?\" came the querulous voice over\nthe wire.\n\nGrayson named it.\n\nWhile Grayson sat with deeply perplexed lines in his face, the\ndiminutive scientist called upon Hutchinson Hatch at his office.\n\n\"Do you use a typewriter?\" demanded The Thinking Machine.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What kind?\"\n\n\"Oh, four or five kinds--we have half a dozen different makes in the\noffice.\"\n\nThey passed along through the city room, at that moment practically\ndeserted, until finally the watery blue eyes settled upon a typewriter\nwith the name emblazoned on the front.\n\n\"That's it!\" exclaimed The Thinking Machine. \"Write something on it,\" he\ndirected Hatch.\n\nHatch drew up a chair and rolled off several lines of the immortal\npractice sentence, beginning, \"Now is the time for all good men--\"\n\nThe Thinking Machine sat beside him, squinting across the room in deep\nabstraction, and listening intently. His head was turned away from the\nreporter, but his ear was within a few inches of the machine. For half a\nminute he sat there listening, then shook his head.\n\n\"Strike your vowels,\" he commanded; \"first slowly, then rapidly.\"\n\nAgain Hatch obeyed, while the scientist listened. And again he shook his\nhead. Then in turn every make of machine in the office was tested the\nsame way. At the end The Thinking Machine rose and went his way. There\nwas an expression nearly approaching complete bewilderment on his face.\n\n\n\nFor hour after hour that night The Thinking Machine half lay in a huge\nchair in his laboratory, with eyes turned uncompromisingly upward, and\nan expression of complete concentration on his face. There was no change\neither in his position or his gaze as minute succeeded minute; the brow\nwas deeply wrinkled now, and the thin line of the lips was drawn taut.\nThe tiny clock in the reception room struck ten, eleven, twelve, and\nfinally one. At just half-past one The Thinking Machine rose suddenly.\n\n\"Positively I am getting stupid!\" he grumbled half aloud. \"Of course! Of\ncourse! Why couldn't I have thought of that in the first place?...\"\n\nSo it came about that Grayson did not go to his office on the following\nmorning at the usual time. Instead, he called again upon The Thinking\nMachine in eager, expectant response to a note which had reached him at\nhis home just before he started to his office.\n\n\"Nothing yet,\" said The Thinking Machine as the financier entered. \"But\nhere is something you must do today. At one o'clock,\" the scientist went\non, \"you must issue orders for a gigantic deal of some sort; and you\nmust issue them precisely as you have issued them in the past; there\nmust be no variation. Dictate the letters as you have always done to\nMiss Winthrop--_but don't send them_! When they come to you, keep them\nuntil you see me.\"\n\n\"You mean that the deal must be purely imaginative?\" inquired the\nfinancier.\n\n\"Precisely,\" was the reply. \"But make your instructions circumstantial;\ngive them enough detail to make them absolutely logical and convincing.\"\n\nGrayson asked a dozen questions, answers to which were curtly denied,\nthen went to his office. The Thinking Machine again called Hatch on the\ntelephone.\n\n\"I've got it,\" he announced briefly. \"I want the best telegraph operator\nyou know. Bring him along and meet me in the room on the top floor where\nthe telephone is at precisely fifteen minutes before one o'clock\ntoday.\"\n\n\"Telegraph operator?\" Hatch repeated.\n\n\"That's what I said--telegraph operator!\" replied the scientist\nirritably. \"Goodbye.\"\n\nHatch smiled whimsically at the other end as he heard the receiver\nbanged on the hook--smiled because he knew the eccentric ways of this\nsingular man, whose mind so accurately illuminated every problem to\nwhich it was directed. Then he went out to the telegraph room and\nborrowed the principal operator. They were in the little room on the top\nfloor at precisely fifteen minutes of one.\n\nThe operator glanced about in astonishment. The room was still\nunfurnished, save for the telephone box on the wall.\n\n\"What do I do?\" he asked The Thinking Machine.\n\n\"I'll tell you when the time comes,\" responded the scientist, as he\nglanced at his watch.\n\nAt three minutes of one o'clock he handed a sheet of blank paper to the\noperator, and gave him final instructions.\n\nThere was ludicrous mystification on the operator's face; but he obeyed\norders, grinning cheerfully at Hatch as he tilted his cigar up to keep\nthe smoke out of his eyes. The Thinking Machine stood impatiently\nlooking on, watch in hand. Hatch didn't know what was happening, but he\nwas interested.\n\nAt last the operator heard something. His face became suddenly alert. He\ncontinued to listen for a moment, and then came a smile of recognition.\n\n\n\nLess than ten minutes after Miss Winthrop had handed over the\ntypewritten letters of instruction to Grayson for signature, and while\nhe still sat turning them over in his hands, the door opened and The\nThinking Machine entered. He tossed a folded sheet of paper on the desk\nbefore Grayson, and went straight to Miss Winthrop.\n\n\"So you did know Mr. Ralph Matthews after all?\" he inquired.\n\nThe girl rose from her desk, and a flash of some subtle emotion passed\nover her face. \"What do you mean, sir?\" she demanded.\n\n\"You might as well remove the silver box,\" The Thinking Machine went on\nmercilessly. \"There is no further need of the connection.\"\n\nMiss Winthrop glanced down at the telephone extension on her desk, and\nher hand darted toward it. The silver \"vanity\" box was directly under\nthe receiver, supporting it, so that all weight was removed from the\nhook, and the line was open. She snatched the box and the receiver\ndropped back on the hook. The Thinking Machine turned to Grayson.\n\n\"It was Miss Winthrop,\" he said.\n\n\"Miss Winthrop!\" exclaimed Grayson, \"I can't believe it!\"\n\n\"Read the paper I gave you, Mr. Grayson,\" directed The Thinking Machine\ncoldly. \"Perhaps that will enlighten her.\"\n\nThe financier opened the sheet, which had remained folded in his hand,\nand glanced at what was written there. Slowly he read it aloud:\n\"PEABODY--Sell ten thousand shares L. & W. at 97. MCCRACKEN Co.--Sell\nten thousand shares L. & W. at 97.\" He read on down the list,\nbewildered. Then gradually, as he realized the import of what he read,\nthere came a hardening of the lines about his mouth.\n\n\"I understand, Miss Winthrop,\" he said at last. \"This is the substance\nof the orders I dictated, and in some way you made them known to persons\nfor whom they were not intended. I don't know how you did it, of course;\nbut I understand that you did do it, so----\" He stepped to the door and\nopened it with grave courtesy. \"You may go now.\"\n\nMiss Winthrop made no plea--merely bowed and went out. Grayson stood\nstaring after her for a moment, then turned to The Thinking Machine and\nmotioned him to a chair. \"What happened?\" he asked briskly.\n\n\"Miss Winthrop is a tremendously clever woman,\" replied The Thinking\nMachine. \"She neglected to tell you, however, that besides being a\nstenographer and typist she is also a telegraph operator. She is so\nexpert in each of her lines that she combined the two, if I may say it\nthat way. In other words, in writing on the typewriter, she was clever\nenough to be able to _give the click of the machine the patterns in the\nMorse telegraphic code_--so that another telegraph operator at the other\nend of the 'phone could hear her machine and translate the clicks into\nwords.\"\n\nGrayson sat staring at him incredulously. \"I still don't understand,\" he\nsaid finally.\n\nThe Thinking Machine rose and went to Miss Winthrop's desk. \"Here is an\nextension telephone with the receiver on the hook. It happens that the\nlittle silver box which you gave Miss Winthrop is just tall enough to\nlift this receiver clear of the hook, and the minute the receiver is off\nthe hook the line is open. When you were at your desk and she was here,\nyou couldn't see this telephone; therefore it was a simple matter for\nher to lift the receiver, and place the silver box underneath, thus\nholding the line open permanently. That being true, the sound of the\ntypewriter--_the striking of the keys_--would go over the open wire to\nwhoever was listening at the other end. Then, if the striking of the\nkeys typed out your letters and, by their frequency and pauses,\nsimultaneously tapped out telegraphic code, an outside operator could\nread your letters at the same moment they were being written. That is\nall. It required extreme concentration on Miss Winthrop's part to type\naccurately in Morse rhythms.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" exclaimed Grayson.\n\n\"When I knew that the leak in your office was not in the usual way,\"\ncontinued The Thinking Machine, \"I looked for the unusual. There is\nnothing very mysterious about it now--it was merely clever.\"\n\n\"Clever!\" repeated Grayson, and his jaws snapped. \"It is more than that.\nWhy, it's criminal! She should be prosecuted.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't advise that, Mr. Grayson,\" returned the scientist coldly.\n\"If it is honest--merely business--to juggle stocks as you told me you\ndid, this is no more dishonest. And besides, remember that Miss Winthrop\nis backed by the people who have made millions out of you, and--well, I\nwouldn't prosecute. It is betrayal of trust, certainly; but--\" He rose\nas if that were all, and started toward the door. \"I would advise you,\nhowever, to discharge the person who operates your switchboard.\"\n\n\"Was she in the scheme, too?\" demanded Grayson. He rushed out of the\nprivate office into the main office. At the door he met a clerk coming\nin.\n\n\"Where is Miss Mitchell?\" demanded the financier hotly.\n\n\"I was just coming to tell you that she went out with Miss Winthrop just\nnow without giving any explanation,\" replied the clerk.\n\n\"Good day, Mr. Grayson,\" said The Thinking Machine.\n\nThe financier nodded his thanks, then stalked back into his room.\n\n\n\nIn the course of time The Thinking Machine received a check for ten\nthousand dollars, signed, \"J. Morgan Grayson.\" He glared at it for a\nlittle while, then indorsed it in a crabbed hand, _Pay to the Trustees'\nHome for Crippled Children_, and sent Martha, his housekeeper, out to\nmail it.\n\n\n\n\n",
