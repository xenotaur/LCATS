BRETNOR\n\n\n\n[Sidenote: If not for two items, this would be a funny story--the Atomic\nAge brought back the 1925 vogue, and inhibition is not shatter-proof.]\n\nOn a clear spring evening in 2189, Charles Edward Button came home half\nan hour late for his supper, tossed his hat to the robot butler who came\nout from behind the DoItAll, and announced that he had just bought a\nplanet.\n\nHis wife, Betty, was looking small and long-suffering on a plastic\nreproduction of a Victorian love-seat, and her cousin Aurelia, a large,\nhandsome woman, was standing behind her protectively.\n\n\"Of course,\" he informed them, \"it's not a _big_ planet. But what a\nbargain! With real oceans, and two moons, and--\"\n\n\"Real estate, real estate, real estate!\" Cousin Aurelia's tart voice cut\nhim off in mid-sentence. \"You know what's come of every one of your\ninvestments. Call the man _right now_ and tell him you want your money\nback!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it's too late.\" Charles avoided her eye. \"I bought it up at\na tax-auction and--well, the government never refunds.\"\n\n\"I _thought_ so. A planet nobody wants. Probably all run down, with\nswamps and deserts, and in some dreadful, shabby district where the\nneighbors have squirmy tentacles, or eyes on stalks, or big, nasty\nbeaks!\"\n\n\"It isn't at all. It's in a good neighborhood--only two systems away\nfrom the Inchcapes' new summer planet. A little remote, but that means\nmore privacy.\" He took a catalogue out of his pocket. \"'Parcel 71,'\" he\nread. \"'Sugar Plum, a Class IV planet'--that means it's like Earth, only\nbigger--'claimed 8/12/85 by Space Captain Alexander Burgee, under\nPlanetary Homestead Act of 2147 (amended.)' And here's his description\nof the place where he landed: 'Neat as a pin, fine climate, full of\ncritters and fish, quite uninhabited.' He was lost in Deep Space, poor\nfellow. That's why they sold it.\"\n\n\n\nBetty smiled faintly. \"The Inchcapes call their planet Bide-A-Wee. I\nthink Sugar Plum's ever so much nicer. But--but can we afford it?\"\n\n\"We certainly can't!\" fumed Cousin Aurelia. \"We'll put it back on the\nmarket and salvage whatever we can.\"\n\n\"No, we won't,\" Charles said firmly. \"And it's not just a summer resort.\nWe're pulling up stakes to live there all year round.\"\n\nBetty gasped.\n\nCousin Aurelia straightened up, bristling.\n\n\"I have made up my mind,\" Charles went on. \"I have done a lot of serious\nthinking.\" He pointed at the heavily framed neo-daguerreotype portraits\non the walls. \"Our ancestors rediscovered the only _true_ principles,\nthose of the great Nineteenth Century. They brought the Second Victorian\nAge into being. Civilization reached its peak, its full flowering. But\nnow all is crumbling before the poisonous onslaught of modernism. We who\nhave not been corrupted must seek out a refuge. That, Cousin, is why I\nbought Sugar Plum.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Cousin Aurelia. \"There may be changes everywhere\nelse, but never in Boston.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" Charles looked at his watch. \"Solomon!\" he called out.\n\nThe butler came bowing out of the DoItAll nook, where the servants\nstayed when they were switched off. He wore a swallowtail coat and\nknee-breeches, and had kinky white hair. Made to order, he was Cousin\nAurelia's idea.\n\n\"Yassuh, Marse Charles. Here Ah is.\"\n\n\"Solomon,\" ordered Charles, \"tune in Watson Widgett.\"\n\nBetty paled, uttering a polite little scream.\n\n\"Are you _mad_?\" cried Cousin Aurelia. \"I've heard about him. I'll not\nhave that man in _my_ home!\"\n\nCharles squared his shoulders. \"Cousin, may I remind you that _I_ am\nhead of this house, and that we are _Victorians_? It's high time you\nfound out what's going on. Solomon!\"\n\n\"Yass_uh_.\"\n\nThere was a click from the DoItAll, a brief flash of light and a figure\nappeared in their midst, a cheerful young man in loose trousers and\nshirt, without coat, waistcoat, cravat, or even a pair of suspenders. He\nwas grinning at Cousin Aurelia.\n\n\"Boys and girls,\" he was saying, \"Wyoming has outlawed corsets! The\nfolks in Siskiyou, California, have given women the vote! And listen to\nthis. The Bikini swimsuit--just a wisp and a twist--is back on the\nmarket!\" He winked loathsomely. \"Yes, indeed, our prize fake Victorians,\nour second-hand stuffed shirts, are due for a fall. Here's the best news\ntoday, from a cute little lady right here in old Boston.\" He unfolded a\npaper. \"Dear Watsy, When I first found your program, I was a real Mrs.\nBiedermeyer. Marriage was something we gentlewomen tried to endure while\nwe knitted an anti-macassar. It wasn't supposed to be fun. Then a friend\ntipped me off to your--\"\n\nAt this point, Cousin Aurelia emitted a shriek, rolled her eyes and\ncrumpled to the carpet.\n\nCharles gestured and the commentator vanished with a click and a flash.\nBetty scurried out and returned with the smelling salts.\n\nPresently, Cousin Aurelia regained her senses, shivered, and said, \"It's\ntoo awful for words. If it were not for Betty, I would surely have left\nlong ago. As it is, I shall go where you go, to protect her, of course.\"\n\nThen she permitted Betty to help her to her feet and out of the room.\n\n\"Solomon!\" Charles called loudly.\n\n\"Yassuh, Marse Charles.\"\n\n\"Set the table for two,\" Charles commanded. \"I shall dial the dinner\nmyself.\"\n\nHe felt very adventurous and masterful. Dialing dinner without aid was\nfine training in self-reliance.\n\n\n\nSix weeks later, the three of them stood on the bridge of the space\nfreighter _Beautiful Joe_, watching Sugar Plum as the vessel entered an\norbit around it.\n\nBut Charles Edward Button didn't feel at all masterful, or even\nadventurous.\n\nThey stood next to Possett, the skipper, a great, hairy man with gold\nteeth, a bad squint, and an air of gloomy cunning about him. After her\nfirst look at Possett, Cousin Aurelia had locked herself in her cabin,\nallowing no one but Betty to approach her, and threatening to subsist on\nthe half-dozen cases of Dr. Stringfellow's Vegetable Remedy she kept\nunder her berth. Charles, however, had been sure that Possett's heart\nwas both kindly and chivalrous.\n\n\"Take those tall stories of his,\" he said more than once. \"Betty, they\ndon't mean a thing. Old spacedogs love to kid tenderfeet. Imagine trying\nto make me believe that it's dangerous out here! And all that malarkey\nabout Captain Burgee being a pirate or something!\"\n\nThey stared at Sugar Plum, at its small polar ice caps, its seas, its\ncontinents greener than Earth's, its wandering white clouds. Not many\nhours before, it had been only a dust mote, a pinpoint of light in the\nvoid. Now it filled half the sky. And suddenly Charles understood the\nimmensities, the unspeakable stretches of space in which Boston had\nvanished.\n\nShivering, he wished he were home, stiffly safe in a curlicued chair,\nwith Solomon dialing his dinner for him.\n\n\"Nice piece of property,\" grunted Possett around his cigar. \"Too bad\nabout--\" He broke off with a shrug.\n\n\"About what?\" asked Charles, alarmed.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be in your shoes if Burgee comes around and finds\nyou'd run off with his planet.\"\n\n\"Burgee? He was lost out in space!\"\n\n\"His kind don't stay lost. Chances are he's hiding out from the law. But\nit's none of my business. Just thought I'd warn you.\"\n\nCharles laughed weakly. \"You c-can't frighten me. I'm sure there aren't\nany pirates in space any more.\"\n\nPossett turned to his weasel-faced mate. \"Loopy, call the New Texas\nspaceport. Get Mac on the screen.\"\n\nThe mate nodded. He twiddled a dial and punched at a switch. The screen\nglowed. After some seconds, the face of a red-haired person appeared,\nlooking rather disgusted.\n\n\"New Texas, New Texas,\" came a voice. \"I hear you, _Beautiful Joe_. What\nthe hell do you want?\"\n\n\"Dude aboard wants some info,\" said Possett. \"Wants to know what Burgee\ndid for a living--Alexander Burgee. Also, are the coppers still trying\nto find him?\"\n\nThe face frowned. \"Possett, you know damn well Burgee was a pirate. You\nknow he's been listed as lost. Now quit wasting my time. New Texas out.\"\n\nThe face vanished. The mate snickered nastily. And Charles just stood\nthere gaping.\n\n\"A real pirate!\" squeaked Cousin Aurelia. \"Wh-what would he do? Would he\n_kill_ us?\"\n\n\"Might do anything. But--\" eying her, Possett leered--\"he's like me.\nLikes 'em well fattened up. Lady, you needn't worry.\"\n\nCousin Aurelia paled. She started to sway. Then, perhaps recalling the\nuncarpeted deck, she recovered and looked haughty instead.\n\n\"I am going right back to my cabin,\" she proclaimed, and stalked off the\nbridge.\n\n\"Cousin Aurelia is very genteel,\" Betty snapped at the captain. \"You had\nno right to insult her. Besides, she's only twenty pounds overweight.\"\n\n\"Don't mind me. I go for her type.\" Possett shook his head darkly and\nturned toward Charles. \"Button, man to man, a back-country planet's no\nplace for the ladies. Look, I'll take the thing off your hands. I can\nhandle Burgee. Twelve thousand cold cash for your stuff and the deed,\nand I'll throw in a lift to New Texas. There's a liner from there.\"\n\nCharles thought of the comfortable Earth and was tempted. \"But I paid\nthirty-five,\" he protested uncertainly. \"I mean, twelve is--\"\n\n\"Take it or leave it. I'm trying to do you a favor.\"\n\n\"No, I guess we'll leave it,\" answered Betty.\n\nCharles looked around in surprise. Her lips were compressed, her blue\neyes narrowed with astonishing determination.\n\n\"We've come all this way,\" she declared, \"so we might as well keep it. I\nthink it has--well, possibilities. We've had the whole house done over\nand the servants remodeled. And we'll have all the DoItAll\nservices--teleprojection, medical care, and everything else--from the\nNew Texas substation. I'm sure we'll get along nicely.\"\n\nThe skipper of the _Beautiful Joe_ wasn't pleased. \"It's your necks.\nDon't be blaming me for what happens,\" he growled. \"Well, where do you\nwant to set down?\"\n\n\"Set down?\" gulped Charles. \"R-right now?\"\n\n\"Land and unload, it says in the contract. I ain't got all day. I'll\ndump you at Burgee's old landing, load up with fresh water, and blast\noff for New Texas.\"\n\nCharles had no other spot in mind.\n\n\"Okay,\" Possett said to the two robot crewmen at the main controls,\n\"take her down.\"\n\n\n\nAt the waterfall's edge, flowering trees twisted their roots in the\ncliffside, and a fresh wind scattered plumes of its spray through their\nleaves. Taller trees, bell-blossomed, fanned out from the pool, gave way\nto a meadow, and followed the course of the stream down a broadening\nvalley--among faceted boulders of translucent quartz, rose-pink, green,\nand golden, sheltering small, lustrous spires of fragile fungi.\n\nOn the meadow stood the house, the latest in Second Victorian, complete\nwith carved plastic false-front in early Schenectady Gothic. The Buttons\nthemselves, with Cousin Aurelia, stood in front of it. They wore long\nlinen dusters and sun helmets with heavy mosquito veils. They were going\nexploring.\n\nCousin Aurelia was sputtering: \"Do you know what he said when he left?\n'Kid, you come along with Mike Possett. You don't want no part of that\nplanet. I'll show you a ripsnorting time!' Then he gave me a look\nthat--that was positively _lecherous_.\" She shuddered. \"At least we'll\nhave no more of that nonsense. Your planet is uninhabited.\"\n\nBetty looked worried. \"I've the funniest feeling,\" she said. \"As if\nsomeone was watching.\"\n\n\"That's absurd!\" snapped Cousin Aurelia. \"You must be imagin--\" She\nstopped in her tracks. \"Wh-what's _that_?\"\n\nThey looked. A large, soft, fuzzy beast had come out from under the\ntrees. It was reddish and had very big feet. It blinked at them\nbrightly, climbed a transparent green rock, and started to whistle, not\ntoo tunefully, through its long Roman nose.\n\nAlmost instantly, another emerged, a size smaller. Lowering its eyelids\ncoquettishly, it began clapping its forepaws.\n\n\"Charles, they must be the 'critters' Burgee mentioned in that\ncatalogue. Remember? I'm sure they're perfectly harmless.\"\n\nTwo more animals appeared and made for a rock of their own. And then\nthere were, suddenly, dozens--all around the edge of the meadow. These\nwere petite, creamy, with lavender ears. They came bounding forward in\npairs, sat up and regarded the Buttons solemnly.\n\nCharles began to relax. Somehow, Sugar Plum didn't seem half so enormous\nany longer, now that they weren't so alone.\n\n\"I wonder if they could be tamed.\" Betty was wistful.\n\n\"They're certain to be just full of fleas,\" sniffed Cousin Aurelia.\n\nThe creatures were playful. As the Buttons walked over the meadow, they\nfrolicked around them--\n\nBut they also were very affectionate. As they frolicked, they flirted.\nEvery once in a while, each pair would pause to rub noses, to murmur\nseductively, to nip one another.\n\nAt first, Cousin Aurelia tried to pretend they weren't there. But\nfinally she halted. \"Charles Edward Button, I won't go a step farther\ntill you drive those nasty things away. It's disgraceful. They're apt to\ndo--anything!\"\n\nCharles flushed under his netting. \"Shoo!\" he said ineffectively. \"Beat\nit!\"\n\nThere was a swift patter of feet straight ahead and a figure flashed\ninto view. She was slim. She was small, with a girdle and headdress of\nfeathers. Her skin was sky-blue, and her ears were pointed, and her eyes\nwere simply enormous. But she looked distressingly human.\n\nIn an instant, she vanished. As the Buttons stood there goggling, they\nheard more running footsteps, somewhat heavier, and a scuffle, a giggle,\na clear, tenor laugh, and then silence.\n\n\"Why, that was a girl!\" Betty gasped.\n\n\"She was being pursued!\" Charles exclaimed. \"He--he caught her!\"\n\n\"Oooh!\" moaned Cousin Aurelia, covering her eyes. \"Charles, how _could_\nyou? Enticing us here, saying it was uninhabited!\"\n\nThen, before Charles could find a reply:\n\n\"Unin_hab_ited?\" chuckled a deep male voice right behind them. \"It\ncertainly isn't. It's just unin_hib_ited!\"\n\n\n\nSlowly, the Buttons turned around. There, by an odd square tree, stood a\nman even bigger than Possett, smoking a pipe. He was middle-aged. He\nwore a heavy brown beard, khaki shorts, a deep coat of tan, and a\nself-possessed smile.\n\nHe bowed. \"Burgee is my name--Space Captain Alexander Burgee. Glad to\nmake your acquaintance.\"\n\n\"It's him!\" screamed Cousin Aurelia. \"And he's practically naked!\" She\npointed a cotton-gloved finger, began backing away. \"You fiend, don't\nyou come any nearer. Don't you _touch_ me!\"\n\nThe captain looked very surprised. \"Why would I want to?\"\n\nHer voice reached a new high and clung there. \"You--you libertine! You\nmay lead a riotous life with these natives, but you won't work your will\non me. I'll lock myself in till the police can come from New Texas!\"\n\nAnd, tripping and stumbling over her duster, she fled.\n\nAs the door banged behind her, the captain nudged a large beast off a\nnearby rock, and sat down. \"I can see that Earth hasn't changed,\" he\nremarked. \"You tourists still seem to have the daffiest notions.\" He\nsounded quite hurt. \"Look, these natives are nice little people. They're\nharmless. I call 'em my Sugar Plum pixies, and sometimes we grin at each\nother. But that's all. They aren't much past the animal stage. Besides,\nthey lay eggs. Oh, well--\" he shrugged as the Buttons exchanged knowing\nlooks--\"I have plenty of room at the house and I guess you'll be\npermanent guests, so welcome to Sugar Plum, anyway.\"\n\nBetty said angrily, \"Sugar Plum's ours. You didn't pay taxes and they\nsold it at auction. Charles has the deed in his pocket.\"\n\n\"You poor, dumb kids!\" The captain seemed really concerned. \"You bought\nsome fool bureaucrats error. I'm paid up in advance. Come on down, you\ncan see the receipt.\"\n\n\"Aren't you clever?\" said Betty scornfully. \"Well, you won't trap us as\neasily as that. We don't need you or your house.\"\n\n\"You just might want something to eat, or a hot, soapy shower, or a\ntight roof over you when it rains.\"\n\nThe Buttons smiled triumphantly. They had their own house, with a\nDoItAll to do everything for them.\n\n\"You can leave us alone, Mr. Pirate Burgee. Captain Possett told us your\nwhole horrible story, and Cousin Aurelia is calling the police right\nthis minute.\"\n\n\"Possett?\" The captain's face twitched. \"Mike Possett, of the _Beautiful\nJoe_?\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Charles felt very superior. \"Now you beat it before--\"\n\nHe didn't finish. From the house came a loud, anguished cry.\n\nThey whirled.\n\nCousin Aurelia, disheveled without helmet or duster, was almost upon\nthem.\n\n\"Charles! It won't work!\"\n\nShe reached him, threw her arms round his neck and hung on.\n\n\"I can't turn the servants on, or the teleprojection, or even the keys\nto the closets. Oh, Charles, we'll have nothing to eat, or to drink, or\nto wear!\"\n\n\"That's impossible. DoItAlls never break down.\"\n\n\"We can't live without it!\" screeched Cousin Aurelia. \"We're millions of\nmiles from Boston! We're marooned with that monster!\"\n\n\n\nBurgee's long, low house was indecently plain, without even so much as a\ngimcrack or bit of gingerbread decoration. Its many wide windows looked\nout over a lake set with islands. Its living room had broad, cushioned\ncouches and indolent chairs--all suspiciously comfortable.\n\nIn exactly such houses, Charles knew, in the wicked old days, a fate\nworse than death had been practically part of the fixtures.\n\n\"We shouldn't have let him persuade us,\" he worriedly told Betty.\n\"Perhaps we'd have starved, but at least Cousin Aurelia wouldn't have\nlocked herself alone into a strange pirate's bedroom!\"\n\n\"We've been here all afternoon,\" Betty pointed out, \"and he hasn't tried\nanything yet. Besides, he helped carry those cases of hers and he gave\nher the keys himself. It's peculiar. Oh, Charles, do you suppose\nthat--that it's _me_ he's after?\"\n\nBefore he could answer, a robot came in, a practical, old-fashioned\nmodel with four arms for waiting at table.\n\n\"Dinner is served.\" It snapped its aluminum jaws. \"Come to the dining\nroom, please.\"\n\nReluctantly, they obeyed.\n\n\"Whatever you do,\" whispered Charles warningly at the door, \"don't let\nhim ply you with liquor.\"\n\nThe captain stood at the head of the table. He was in full evening\ndress, with a heavy gold-nugget watch chain across his muscular middle.\nHe smelled faintly of mothballs and looked very respectable.\n\nThe Buttons examined the table. There wasn't a sign of absinthe or\nbrandy or even champagne. There was nothing but water.\n\n\"It's too bad your cousin won't join us,\" said the captain, seating them\ncourteously. \"I hope those cartons of hers have something tasty inside\nthem.\"\n\n\"They contain Dr. Stringfellow's Vegetable Remedy and Tonic for\nGentlewomen,\" replied Betty primly. \"It is said to be very nourishing.\"\n\nTheir host shuddered. Recovering, he clapped his hands sharply. \"Oh,\nsteward!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" said the robot, appearing with a big silver tureen and\nsetting it down on the table.\n\nThe Buttons drew back.\n\n\"I can see you don't trust me,\" laughed the captain. \"So we'll serve\neverything out in plain sight. You can shuffle the plates if you want\nto.\" He proceeded to ladle out a clear, fragrant soup. \"There. Take\nwhichever you want.\"\n\nThe Buttons selected their plates. They picked up their spoons, dipped\nthem nervously, made rowing motions.\n\nThe captain ate heartily, talking away between spoonfuls. He told them\nthat Sugar Plum was surrounded by an ionized layer impervious to DoItAll\nwaves. He said he had no use for such gadgets, or for the Age which\nproduced them.\n\n\"And why,\" he demanded, \"did we become fake Victorians? Why are we worse\nthan the real ones? I'll tell you. Because space was too big. It made\npeople feel puny. They wanted a hole to crawl into--something small,\nsafe and stuffy.\"\n\nAs course followed course, he told them how he had retired from piracy\nafter homesteading Sugar Plum. Alone with his robots, he had dismantled\nhis vessel, using its engines for heating and lighting. He had done a\ngood deal of exploring.\n\nThe robot served something like lobster, and something like grouse, and\na roast which might have been venison. It served vegetables in pink,\npear-like clusters and long, golden pods. It served a crisp, succulent\nsalad.\n\nCharles picked at his food, watching Betty with growing uneasiness.\nFirst, her appetite seemed to improve. Then her eyes started to sparkle,\nand the severe little corners of her mouth began to relax. Leaning\nforward intently, she became more and more absorbed in the captain.\n\n\"--and so here I've been ever since,\" he said, as he finished his salad,\n\"and Sugar Plum's just about perfect. Of course, it gets lonely at\ntimes, but--\"\n\nAbruptly, Betty's hand darted out, grabbed the captain's beard.\n\n\"_Beaver!_\" she shouted, laughing and pulling. Then she settled back,\nblushing. \"I've wanted to do that for years.\"\n\nCharles reeled. Here was a crisis! He started to rise; hesitated. Of\ncourse, he was shocked to the core, but, \"Great Scott, she's pretty!\" he\nthought; and at once he felt guilty.\n\nHe stood up, trying hard to look angry.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" he announced, \"you will leave this room--er--instantly.\"\n\n\"Why?\" giggled Betty.\n\n\"Because _ladies_ do not pull gentlemen's beards.\"\n\nThe captain was holding his sides and rocking with laughter.\n\n\"Now, now,\" he protested. \"Let her get it out of her system. 'Beaver's'\na splendid old custom. It's almost Victorian.\"\n\nBetty dimpled, resting her chin on the backs of her interlaced hands.\n\"Don't pay any attention, Captain Burgee. Charlie's a horrid old\nfuss-pot. Why shouldn't I yank at your beard? I like you.\"\n\n\"Betty, the man is a _pirate_!\"\n\n\"Not any more. He's retired. You heard him say so yourself. Anyhow, I\nlike him. I think he'd make an awfully nice husband for Cousin Aurelia.\"\n\nCharles reached for the water, and drained his glass in a spluttering\ngulp.\n\n\"I think so, too,\" the captain agreed, looking pleased. \"I thought so as\nsoon as I saw her. She's exactly my type.\" He sighed. \"But she does seem\na little unfriendly. Do you suppose a guitar and some old-fashioned\nsongs at her window might--well, make her want to get better\nacquainted?\"\n\nCharles thought, \"Not that sour old prune!\" Surprised at himself, he\nswallowed the words just in time.\n\nBetty snickered. \"Poor Cousin Aurelia! I simply can't get over her\nstaying locked in with nothing but Vegetable Remedy. Why, it tastes just\nlike shoe polish. And it's all because she's scared to death to eat or\ndrink anything here. She believes that Sugar Plum's really an--an\nuninhibited planet!\"\n\nShe stopped. She stared at the captain. \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" he said, looking very serious, \"that you don't understand.\nYour Cousin Aurelia is right.\"\n\nBetty wilted. \"You can't mean it!\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly what does it. Maybe it's something in the water\nand air and food--\"\n\nCharles stared at the plates on the table in horror.\n\n\"It's nothing you need be afraid of,\" the captain went on. \"You see, its\neffect just depends on the kind of person you are way inside.\"\n\nBetty began to perk up. She eyed Charles appraisingly.\n\n\"Is Charles the right kind of person?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'm sure he is, and your cousin is, too, though she keeps it pretty\nwell hidden. If they weren't, Sugar Plum would soon let us know it,\nbelieve me.\" He grinned. \"And now let's all go a-courtin'. I'll get my\nguitar and call Herman.\"\n\nHe went to the door and whistled, and instantly a large reddish creature\ncame lolloping in. It saw the guitar and blinked eagerly.\n\nBetty linked her arm in the captain's. \"Come along, Charlie.\"\n\nCharles fumbled around. He was scared.\n\nThen Betty looked over her shoulder and smiled. It was a completely new\nsmile. He had never seen it before. It made him tremble with\napprehension.\n\n\"You know,\" she said softly, \"I think it'll sort of be fun being\nuninhibited.\"\n\nCharles knocked over a glass, and his chair, and he paused only to drink\nsome more water.\n\n\"So,\" he shouted, \"do I!\"\n\n\"I suspected you might,\" said the captain.\n\n\n\nTogether they went out on the porch and sat down in a swing; and, for a\nfew moments, in silence, they watched Sugar Plum's two moons sailing\nthrough the strange, perfumed sky. The larger was celadon green; the\nsmaller, off-white, was glowing, gleaming.\n\nFinally, \"Cousin Aurelia?\" called Betty.\n\n\"Betty, are you out in the dark with that man?\"\n\n\"Charles and I both are. But he isn't a pirate any more and he's really\nquite nice. Besides, he's going to sing to you.\"\n\n\"You tell him to go away--far away. I've barricaded the window and I\nhave my sharp scissors. I warn you, if he makes one false move--\"\n\n\"This is where I came in,\" remarked Charles.\n\nThe captain settled back, tuned his guitar, and started to sing in a\nwarm bass-baritone, with Herman whistling a tenor obbligato through his\nnose. Betty and Charles thought the effect was charming, even if Herman\ndid tend to go a bit flat on the high notes.\n\nFirst, the captain sang _Down by the Old Mill Stream_ and _Sweet\nGenevieve_. Then he tried a number of sentimental arias from the more\nrespectable operas, and _The Lost Chord_, and several other old\nfavorites.\n\nOccasionally, Cousin Aurelia sniffed loudly, but she said nothing until\nhis serenade came to an end.\n\n\"Betty!\" she called. \"Can you hear me?\"\n\n\"Do I have to?\"\n\n\"Tell that person out there that it has done him no good to make those\nungodly noises. My fingers have been in my ears all the time.\"\n\n\"You must've been really a sight,\" giggled Betty.\n\n\"Betty! You--you sound different, somehow.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am! So is Charles. We're both uninhibited now.\"\n\nThere was one cry of horror from Cousin Aurelia and then silence.\n\nBetty turned to the captain. He looked downcast, and Herman did, too.\n\n\"We'll just have to try something else, something clever,\" she told the\ncaptain. \"Cousin Aurelia seems dead set against you. It's because of\nyour being a pirate, I guess.\"\n\n\n\nCharles and Betty spent the next couple of days avoiding any mention of\nthe captain's former profession and helping him think up new ways to\nuninhibit Cousin Aurelia. He tried singing again, this time with an\naugmented chorus of Herman's relations. When that also failed, he cooked\nher a fine mushroom omelette. Then he caught her a young animal with\nlavender ears to keep as a pet and he spent a whole evening reading\n_Sonnets from the Portuguese_ aloud at her window.\n\nShe responded with sniffs and with occasional scraping noises of\nfurniture being moved to reinforce her defenses. Finally, to Betty's\ndistress, she pushed out a note announcing that henceforth she would\nhave nothing to do with the Buttons--and that no one could tell her that\npoems like those were _Victorian_.\n\nBefore the third day was half over, the Captain was moping around,\nCharles was peevish, and Betty had started to worry and fret.\n\nSo, in the late afternoon, they went on a picnic. Followed by Herman,\nand by the four-armed dining room robot carrying two wicker hampers,\nthey walked around the lake to a broad grassy knoll where the strange\nsquare trees grew in a circle, and prisms of quartz leaned from the\nground like Druids turned into stone. While they ate, the night advanced\nsoftly, its moons weaving crystalline shadows of celadon, rose, and old\nivory.\n\nBetty waited until the last hint of daylight had vanished. Then, \"It's\nlovely,\" she whispered. \"Poor Cousin Aurelia, it'd all be so simple if\nshe'd only come out, but--oh, I'm afraid that it's hopeless!\"\n\n\"Hopeless?\" Charles snorted. \"It's easy. We'll break into her room, me\nand Burgee, and hold her while you pour some of Sugar Plum's water down\nher gullet. She'll be fixed up before she finds out what hit her.\"\n\n\"We mustn't do that,\" the captain said stiffly. \"We can't employ\nviolence.\"\n\n\"Look who's talking!\" Charles was amused. \"An old pirate like you.\nRobbing ships, making passengers walk the plank into space, shooting\npeople with ray guns, and--\"\n\n\"Shh!\" Betty warned. \"Charles, that isn't polite. You know he's\nsensitive about--\"\n\nThe captain seemed to be strangling. \"And I thought it was _snobbery_!\"\nThen he exploded with laughter. He lay back on the grass and he howled.\n\nThe Buttons stared in amazement, and some creatures came out of the\ntrees to see what the uproar was all about.\n\nThe captain sat up. \"What century is this?\" he asked.\n\n\"The Twenty-second, of course,\" answered Betty. \"But--but why?\"\n\n\"I just wondered. I'll tell you later.\" He controlled himself with an\neffort. \"But we really mustn't use force on Aurelia, even in such a good\ncause. It might turn her into the wrong kind of person.\"\n\n\"Turn her?\" Betty repeated sadly. \"I'm afraid that she already is. I\ndon't think she'll ever come out. I'm afraid she'll do something\ndesperate.\"\n\n\"I'm worried, too,\" the captain admitted, \"but I'm certain she is the\nright kind. The wrong kind of people can't live here. Sugar Plum doesn't\nlike them.\"\n\nBetty and Charles both looked puzzled.\n\n\"I'll try to explain. It happens within a few hours, even if they aren't\nuninhibited. If they are, then it's practically instantaneous. It's a--\"\n\nHe broke off and looked up at the sky with a frown. There was an angry\nred glow right above them, a far-distant roar.\n\nThey leaped to their feet. The glow brightened swiftly. It seemed to be\nheaded straight for them. The sound filled the air.\n\n\"We have visitors!\" shouted the captain.\n\n\"Wh-who?\" stammered Betty. \"The police?\"\n\n\"They don't use braking jets any more. It's an obsolete freighter.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Betty put her hands to her face in terror. \"It's the _Beautiful\nJoe_. That man Possett--he's coming back after Cousin Aurelia!\"\n\nThe red glow passed to the northward. They saw the ship's shape for a\nmoment, spurting flame, slowing. Then it dropped out of sight. The\nground shuddered briefly. There was quiet.\n\nThe captain grabbed Betty's arm. \"They're down in the clearing. Quick!\nWhen he dropped you, did Possett take anything with him?\"\n\n\"Just a fresh supply of water.\"\n\n\"My God!\" blurted Charles. \"That means they're--\"\n\n\"_Uninhibited!_\" yelled the captain. \"And they're the wrong kind of\npeople. Betty! Charles! Can you run? Hey, Steward, give them a hand!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" snapped the robot, hoisting the hampers and reaching an\nelbow to each of the Buttons.\n\n\"Then let's go. I hope we can make it in time to save them!\"\n\n\"_Them?_\" gulped Charles, as the robot started to run.\n\nBut the captain already was too far ahead to have heard him.\n\n\n\nPulled by the untiring robot, Charles and Betty made very good time, but\nthey couldn't catch up with the captain. They had to make several stops\nto get their wind back, and they were still half a mile from the house\nwhen they heard her.\n\n\"Help! Murder! Police! Save me!\" screamed Cousin Aurelia.\n\n\"He--he's got her!\" puffed Charles, as the shrieks died away. \"Hurry!\"\n\nWhen they got to the house, it was empty. Not even Herman was there. In\nthe living room and the hall, there were signs of a titanic struggle.\nThe door of Cousin Aurelia's room hung wide open.\n\n\"Look!\" Charles gave it a great goldfish stare. \"She unlocked it\nherself!\"\n\n\"He probably told her--he was rescuing her--from the pirate,\" panted\nBetty.\n\n\"We--we'll have to go on--\" Charles felt his legs start to collapse--\"to\nthe clearing.\"\n\nThe robot put two arms around him, and one around Betty.\n\n\"You will rest for three minutes,\" it stated, leading them to the living\nroom and seating them gently. \"I will bring brandy.\"\n\nThe brandy was welcome. They drank it in gulps, and worried about Cousin\nAurelia, and the robot fanned them considerately while they did so.\n\nThen, again, they were off. In less than ten minutes, they looked down\non the valley, on the clearing. They caught sight of the _Beautiful\nJoe_. The voice of the waterfall reached them.\n\nAnd so did another one. A man's voice. A deep one.\n\n\"Ow!\" it yelled hoarsely. \"Let me up! Ow! Let go!\"\n\nCharles moaned. \"We shouldn't have waited for brandy. Now they're\nkilling him, too!\"\n\nWith the robot behind them, they raced down the hill, splashed through\nthe stream, broke through a circle of giggling Sugar Plum natives and\ngoggle-eyed creatures.\n\n\"Don't give up!\" croaked Charles. \"We're coming!\"\n\nOn the grass were four figures. Two were thrashing around and being sat\non. Two were doing the sitting.\n\nThe Buttons braked to a stop. Something was radically wrong. The larger\nof the two thrashing figures was being sat on by Cousin Aurelia!\n\n\"Try to kidnap _me_, will you?\" _Slap._ \"Make me throw myself into that\npool!\" _Slap._ \"And swallow a gallon of water and have to drag myself\nout!\" _Slap-slap-slap_. \"You will, will you?\"\n\n\"Ow!\" cried the figure. \"Leg-go!\"\n\nAurelia looked over her shoulder. She spied Charles and Betty.\n\n\"Hey!\" she shouted. \"Bear a hand here with Possett!\"\n\n\"You don't have to hold him,\" called Captain Burgee, dismounting from\nLoopy the mate. \"He can't get away. Sugar Plum's got him.\"\n\nThey both rose and the two writhing figures continued to writhe.\n\n\"They're _scratching_,\" Charles exclaimed.\n\nHe wasn't quite right. The skipper and the mate of the _Beautiful Joe_\nwere trying to scratch, but they didn't have enough hands. They were\ngroaning, and bleating, and begging for aid as they wriggled.\n\nCousin Aurelia gave Possett a push with her foot.\n\n\"I'm soaked to the skin,\" she announced. \"Betty, help me off with this\ndress. If I don't wring my petticoat out, I'll catch something.\"\n\n\"Why, Cousin Aurelia!\" Charles blurted. \"In front of the captain?\"\n\n\"And why not?\" she demanded. \"I have undies on, don't I?\"\n\nThe captain broke in, his voice urgent. \"We've got to get these\ncharacters back aboard in a hurry! They can't live on Sugar Plum;\nthey're the wrong kind of people. I started to tell you. They're\nallergic to the critters, the trees, the natives--to everything here.\nYou, Steward!\" He beckoned. \"Call the crew of the _Beautiful Joe_.\"\n\nThe robot ran to the ship. It whistled. Immediately, four other robots\nappeared.\n\n\"Bosun,\" said the captain to the one in the lead, \"Captain Possett is\nill. He is--er--delirious. The mate, too. Carry them in. And take off\nquickly for New Texas.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\" The bosun saluted.\n\nThey lifted up Possett, who was grunting and swearing. They hoisted the\nweasel-faced mate. The hatches clanged shut. Fire burst from the stern.\nThe ship lifted.\n\nWhen there was quiet again, Cousin Aurelia looked at the captain. She\nexamined him carefully.\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" she murmured to Betty. \"Not bad. Not bad at all!\"\n\nThen, \"Alexander Burgee,\" she declared, \"every bit of this is your\nfault. If I hadn't escaped from that man and jumped in the pool--well, I\ndon't know _what_ might've happened. The least you can do is carry me\nback to your house.\"\n\n\n\nAt midnight, Charles and Betty sat in the living room. They hadn't had\ntime to get used to the change in Cousin Aurelia and they still looked\nat her unbelievingly. She was wearing a gay housecoat of Betty's, too\ntight in just the right places. She had let down her hair, tied it with\na ribbon, and she'd put on a gay smear of lipstick. She was exceedingly\nmerry.\n\n\"I can't imagine how I stood it,\" she was saying, \"for so many years. I\nmean, being such an old frump.\" She laughed brightly. \"Why, I was almost\nas bad as poor Charlie!\"\n\n\"Well, at least I never locked myself in to get away from a pirate,\"\nCharles retorted.\n\nThe captain stood up with a chuckle. \"Say, that reminds me.\" He went to\na bookcase, opened a thick volume, and gave it to Charles. \"I want you\nto read something here.\"\n\nCharles saw that it was _Jane's Dictionary of Space Transportation_. He\nlooked up enquiringly.\n\nThe captain was pointing at a word.\n\n\"'_Pirate_,'\" Charles read, sounding puzzled. \"'Pirate, originally a\ncriminal who attacked and robbed ships at sea (see: Earth, planet) now\nobsolete in this sense. At present, term applied to--'\" Charles\nhesitated--\"'to persons engaged in space salvage, especially to captains\nof vessels employed in such work.'\"\n\nCharles turned red. Betty flushed. Cousin Aurelia started laughing her\nhead off.\n\n\"Times change,\" the captain said soberly. \"Do you want me to show you my\nlicense?\"\n\nThe Buttons were much too embarrassed to answer.\n\n\"Well, if you don't, I hope you'll excuse us. Aurelia and I would like\nto sit in the swing and look at the stars for a while.\"\n\n\"I want to be told just how far away Boston is,\" she said as he helped\nher to rise. She wrinkled her nose. \"I'm certainly glad that here on\nSugar Plum we're safe from the wrong kind of people--all those horrible\nVictorians.\"\n\nThe captain's arm went around her.\n\nHe winked at the Buttons.\n\n\"A few of them weren't so bad,\" he said gently. \"A few of the real\nones.\"\n\nAnd, as they left, he slipped the copy of _Sonnets from the Portuguese_\ninto his pocket.\n\n\"Well, now that we've sort of lost Cousin Aurelia,\" said Betty, \"I wish\nI could have one of these adorable animals on Sugar Plum for my very\nown. As a pet, you know. It might help as a substitute for Cousin\nAurelia's company.\"\n\n\"And what's wrong with me for a substitute?\" Charles wanted to know. \"It\nseems to me that you can forget Cousin Aurelia for a change and give me\na little consideration.\"\n\nShe looked at him appraisingly and then at her watch.\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" she said. \"It's time for bed.\"\n\n\n\nLater, she sat up, studied him hard for a moment, and shook her head\nwistfully.\n\n\"Oh, Charles, you'd be perfect,\" she said, \"if you only had lavender\nears.\"\n\n\"That shouldn't be much trouble,\" he answered gravely. \"I'll signal a\npassing spaceship, get to New Texas and have my ears tattooed. Good\nenough?\"\n\nShe nuzzled against his neck.\n\n\"Wonderful, darling. It would make you look so--so Bohemian!\"\n\nIt was the finest compliment Charles had ever received.\n\n\n",
