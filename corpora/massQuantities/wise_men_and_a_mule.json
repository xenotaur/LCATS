I tell yuh she\u2019s a dinger,\nand I\u2019m a heap in favor of showin\u2019 it to the multitude, _ad lib_, also\nvisibly.\u201d\n\n\u201cMagpie\u201d Simpkins shifts his feet on the table and leans back in his\nchair, acting like he\u2019s said something real smart.\n\n\u201cThe best ever told,\u201d admits \u201cOld Testament\u201d Tilton. \u201cI longs to see\nit portrayed piously and with feelin\u2019 aforethought.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut can she be done?\u201d asks Wick Smith. \u201cThe time is short.\u201d\n\n\u201cPiperock can do anything she sets out to do,\u201d states Magpie.\n\n\u201cAnd everything else that could possibly happen between the time she\nstarts and the time she finishes,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cI figured it was about time for you to say something, Ike,\u201d opines\nMagpie.\n\nMe and \u201cDirty Shirt\u201d Jones wasn\u2019t invited to this conference, but\nwe\u2019re there anyway. Buck Masterson, Wick Smith, Judge Steele, Old\nTestament and Magpie are the committee. Dirty said there\u2019d likely be\nneed of substitutes before the meeting had gone far, so we took it\nupon ourselves to attend.\n\n\u201cThree wise men won\u2019t be hard to find,\u201d opines Buck.\n\n\u201cTown\u2019s full of \u2019em,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cWhy stop at three?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve spoke your piece, Dirty,\u201d states the judge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have a star, ain\u2019t we?\u201d asks Buck.\n\n\u201cYeah, we sure have,\u201d admits Wick.\n\n\u201cBeyond the shadder of a doubt in my mind,\u201d says the judge. \u201cThe star\nmust be there, sheddin\u2019 its effulgent rays across the desert, lightin\u2019\nup the\u2014uh\u2014place, as it were. It\u2019s goin\u2019 to be hard to get a suitable\ncamule or camules.\u201d\n\n\u201cCamule?\u201d asks Buck. \u201cThem humpbacked quadruples?\u201d\n\n\u201cCam-el,\u201d corrects Magpie. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ve got to have one. We\u2019ve got to\nhave a lot of presents and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to be Sandy Claws?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\n\u201cNobody!\u201d snaps Magpie. \u201cThem things are out of date. We\u2019re just\nsteppin\u2019 along ahead of them ancient has-beens, yuh betcha. Nobody can\ngo home from this celebration and say we had the same old stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe \u2014\u2014 lucky if they has the use of their vocal cords ten days\nafterwards,\u201d opines Dirty. \u201cPiperock\u2019s Merry Christmas has always\nknocked \u2014\u2014 out of Happy New Year\u2019s. I suppose you\u2019ll frame up a death\ntrap and charge us a dollar apiece to get butchered for a Piperock\nHoliday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is goin\u2019 to be free,\u201d states Magpie.\n\n\u201cJust like a suicide,\u201d sighs Dirty.\n\n\u201cSince when was you and Ike Harper invited to this meetin\u2019?\u201d asks\nWick. \u201c\u2019Pears to me\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going out,\u201d says I, \u201cbut before we erases ourselves from your\npresence we\u2019d like to orate open and free that we will not be part,\nparcel nor accessory to anything pertaining to or being of a Piperock\nentertainment. We will not do this nor that, and neither will we do\nthus and so. We will toil not and neither will we spin to any extent.\nOur hearts are hard and our minds are made up like a mule\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter wait until you\u2019re asked,\u201d advises Magpie.\n\n\u201cNo trouble to sound a warning,\u201d says Dirty Shirt.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d ask in vain, Magpie,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cI am full of wisdom\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t argue with that animated flagpole,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cYou never get\nno place talkin\u2019 back to him, Ike.\u201d\n\nDirty was right. I might as well argue with the shadder of death,\nbecause Magpie can\u2019t hear nothing but his own voice in a argument, and\nhe knows he can hoodle me into places where an angel couldn\u2019t find\nfooting nor room to flop its wings.\n\nI\u2019m sleeping real hard when Magpie comes home that night, and he\nproceeds to sit down on me, yanks my off ear and yells\u2014\n\n\u201cIke!\u201d\n\nI shoves him off and sets up, covering him with my gun.\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d says he, sober-like, \u201cwhat is there around here that looks the\nmost like a ca-mel?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a neck-and-neck race between you and Maud S.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe takes off his clothes and goes to bed, kinda chuckling to himself.\nMaud S wasn\u2019t no relation to the famous trotting mare of the same\nname, unless you figure back to the dim and distant past to the time\nwhen the devil got sore at a balky horse. He tried to haul it along by\nthe ears, but the horse dug in his hoofs, the same of which stretched\nthem ears a heap. When the devil saw what he\u2019d done, he laughed. The\nhorse, being kinda sore, ruined its vocal cords mocking the devil\u2019s\nlaugh. That\u2019s how we got our first mule.\n\nLooking at Maud S from all angles I\u2019d opine that she was the second\nmule.\n\nMaudie was long. I don\u2019t think I ever seen so much mule all in one\npiece. Maud\u2019s neck was long and looked like it might fall off any old\ntime and bust her crop-eared head. Her feet never wore shoes, and the\nends of her hoofs turned up like the ends of ski snowshoes. Maud was\ncock-eyed in her one glass-eye, and her heart was bitter toward\nmankind.\n\nWick Smith owned her. He tried to sell her to a Piegan Indian, but the\nold buck got one look at her and said\u2014\n\n_\u201cDiaub seahhost! Klahowya!\u201d_\n\nThe same of which means\u2014\n\n\u201cEyes of the devil! Good-by!\u201d\n\nOf course Maud ain\u2019t no cam-el, but she ain\u2019t so danged far removed as\nyuh might think. The next morning Magpie gets a heap enthused over\ntheir meeting.\n\n\u201cWe sure planned out some _hy-iu_ festival. Goin\u2019 to be great, Ike.\nSacred, solemn and satisfactory from all points of the compass.\u201d\n\n\u201cUndertakingly speaking?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot this time. There ain\u2019t going to be no guns allowed. Every puncher\nwill have to leave his gun at the door. See the idea? Bill Thatcher\nsays he won\u2019t bring no orchestra, but we\u2019ll have one just as good.\nRicky Henderson has mastered the flute, and Wick Smith\u2019s new drum is\ndue here today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a \u2014\u2014 of a orchestra.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? \u2018Frenchy\u2019 Deschamps fell out with Bill Thatcher, and he\u2019s goin\u2019\nto play his jew\u2019s-harp in our orchestra. That makes three good pieces\nfor our side, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cTin whistle bass drum and a pheumonia noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cMm-m-m-m, well, it won\u2019t be no Suzer\u2019s band, that\u2019s a fact, but it\u2019ll\nbe music. Matilda Mudgett is going to sing something sacred, and Wick\nsays that his wife wants to recite.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything that Matilda could sing would seem sacred,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cShe could sing the \u2018Lone Star Trail\u2019 and make it sound like \u2018Rock of\nAges!\u2019 Magpie, a face like hers would drive the evil from a burro\u2019s\nsoul.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh\u2014I almost forgot, Ike. You\u2019re going to be a wise man.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re danged well right I am. I\u2019m going to be so wise that I won\u2019t\nbe within seven miles of here on Christmas Eve. I ain\u2019t going to be\nwise\u2014I\u2019m wise right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and Dirty Shirt and Half Mile Smith.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo-oo-o-o!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d rather have some other two men\u2014get \u2019em, Ike. I\u2019m leavin\u2019\nthat part of it to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo-o-o-o! I won\u2019t speak to nobody. I\u2019m deaf and dumb. You and your\nentertainment can go plumb\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now that it\u2019s all settled I feel better, Ike. You corral Dirty\nand Half Mile and bring \u2019em over to the Mint Hall tonight, and you\u2019ll\nfind out what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cMagpie Simpkins, for gosh sake\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIke, I\u2019d tell yuh if I knowed, but I don\u2019t. Old Testament knows just\nwhat you\u2019ve got to do, so be patient.\u201d\n\nI finds Dirty Shirt in Buck\u2019s place, and he\u2019s inoculated against\nrattlesnakes. Dirty is bow-legged and cock-eyed, and wouldn\u2019t be no\nbeauty if he wasn\u2019t. I tells him what has come to pass, and he listens\nclose-like. Then he steps inside, yanks out his six-gun, and rings the\nlittle bell on top of the Mint Hall three times in a row. Then he puts\nhis gun back and cocks his eye at me.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t drunk, that\u2019s a cinch. Mebbe my hearin\u2019 is weak, Ike. Say\nthat all over again, will yuh?\u201d\n\nI explains once more. Dirty nods foolish-like.\n\n\u201cSounded the same both times, Ike. What does a wise man have to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Dirty. We\u2019ll find Half Mile and then they\u2019ll explain it\nto us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf Mile\u2019s in jail. He shot three times at \u2018Scenery\u2019 Sims, and\nScenery put him in jail for it. Here comes Scenery now.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere ain\u2019t no description to fit Scenery, except that he\u2019s about five\nfeet tall and his voice squeaks and his mustache only grows at the\ncorners of his big mouth, like the whiskers on a bobcat. He continues\nto be our sheriff, because nobody has took the time to kill him,\nexcept some poor shot, like Half Mile.\n\nWe explains the proposition to Scenery, and asks him will he let Half\nMile be a wise man.\n\n\u201cHow about me?\u201d asks Scenery. \u201cHalf Mile ain\u2019t got no sense. I studied\nellie-cu-shun oncet, and I\u2019ve got a lot of natural sense about things\nlike that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t give a \u2014\u2014,\u201d says Dirty Shirt, \u201conly we wants to die in good\ncompany, Scenery.\u201d\n\n\u201cBein\u2019 the sheriff I\u2019ll see that they don\u2019t get rough.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when has a sheriff been able to intimidate these Yaller Rock\nsnake hunters?\u201d I asks. \u201cThe sight of you up there, Scenery, would be\nlike wavin\u2019 a red rag at a bull.\u201d\n\n\u201cNawsir,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cAnd besides they ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to be allowed\nto bring in no guns, so the judge tells me.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t argue with no tin whistle like that, so we takes him with us\nto our cabin, where we finds Magpie, Old Testament and the judge. We\nexplains that Half Mile is in jail and that Scenery is desirous to be\nwise. Magpie says:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, if he keeps his mouth shut, but we don\u2019t want no\nwise man with a squeaky voice. We\u2019ll let Ike speak all the words what\nis spoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can talk,\u201d says Dirty Shirt, \u201cand I\u2019ve studied ellie-cu-shun. I can\nmake gestures, y\u2019betcha.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t usin\u2019 none in this ta-blew, Dirty,\u201d states the judge.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s to be pulled off almost in the dark, bein\u2019 as she\u2019s a night\npitcher, and gestures ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to do nothin\u2019 but mebbe ruin the\nthing. You hang onto your gestures and let nature take her course.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk ain\u2019t much without yuh gestures,\u201d complains Dirty.\n\n\u201cYour talk wouldn\u2019t be much with \u2019em!\u201d snaps Magpie. \u201cShut up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you knowed anythin\u2019 about ellie-cu-shun, you\u2019d \u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re goin\u2019 to be a wise man, Scenery,\u201d says Magpie, soft-like,\n\u201cyou\u2019ll practise up right now by keepin\u2019 your \u2014\u2014 mouth shut. _Sabe?_\nGo ahead and gesture if yuh want to, but keep still.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if I can\u2019t talk, I won\u2019t, but jist the same\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d howls Magpie. \u201cScenery, if you don\u2019t shut up you\u2019ll never live\nto run for office again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to run again,\u201d says Scenery. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the job\nagain.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudge,\u201d says Magpie, \u201cwe\u2019ll let a certain few bring their guns inside\nthe hall. Now, let\u2019s get down to business. Is Pete Gonyer makin\u2019 the\nstar?\u201d\n\n\u201cMoon. He had a round piece of glass, but he says there ain\u2019t no\ndanged way he can cut a star. Moon will do as well, won\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t get a star; but the Bible says they followed a star.\u201d\n\n\u201cYaller Rock county won\u2019t never know that,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cNot if yuh\ndon\u2019t tell em.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having the stage built twice as big, and then we\u2019ll put dirt\nover the boards so it will look like a desert. We\u2019ll have a curtain\nbuilt along two sides and the back, and we\u2019ve got to have them stairs\nbraced up a little before we can bring Maud S up into the hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Maud S comin\u2019 to the show?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the ca-mel,\u201d explains Magpie. \u201cGoin\u2019 to fix up some humps on\nher back and yuh never could tell her from a ca-mel. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose she brays?\u201d says Scenery.\n\n\u201cSuppose she gestures?\u201d says Dirty. \u201cMy \u2014\u2014, but a mule can gesture.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaud S ain\u2019t got a kick left in her old carcass,\u201d grins Magpie.\n\nJust then Muley Bowles and Chuck Warner shows up, and joins us.\n\n\u201cHear you\u2019re goin\u2019 to celebrate Christmas,\u201d says Chuck, wiggling his\nears.\n\n\u201cWant the Cross J quartet to sing?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cThis is goin\u2019 to be a sanitary proceedin\u2019, and\nthere ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to be nothin\u2019 done that might incite violence. We\u2019re\njust as much obliged as though you burned your shirt, Chuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d sure be willing to help your ceremony,\u201d says Muley. \u201cWe\u2019d sing\nfree gratis for nothin\u2019, without chargin\u2019 you a cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. I ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 against you your punchers\u2014not as individual\nhuman beings, but\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI gets your meanin\u2019, Magpie,\u201d says Chuck. \u201cThe Cross J ain\u2019t good\nenough for your danged old half-baked celebration, eh? Our harmonious\nvoices don\u2019t fit into your blasted old program-me. We has suffered and\nbled that Piperock might make a success of their unusual doings, but\nfrom now on we don\u2019t do a danged thing to help yuh out. Your tone of\nvoice is a insult to four of the best singers in Yaller Rock county.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you understand what I meant,\u201d says Magpie, mean-like. Muley\nand Chuck turns around and beats it for town.\n\n\u201cI reckon you know best, Magpie, but them four Cross J go-devils might\ndo us wrong. Yuh might \u2019a\u2019 let \u2019em sing one song,\u201d opines Testament.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the ca-mel,\u201d suggests Magpie.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get away from Maud S,\u201d says Dirty Shirt.\n\nThen cometh Tellurium Woods, the danged old bald-headed bunch of wind.\nHe\u2019s got a grin on his face.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cI got a idea,\u201d says he. \u201cI\u2019ll be Sandy Claws.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did yuh get it?\u201d asks Magpie. \u201cThis is a Sandy Claw-less\nChristmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw-w-w, yuh can\u2019t do that,\u201d wails Tellurium. \u201cWhatcha tryin\u2019 to\ndo\u2014put the celebration on the bum? Here\u2019s the idea: I\u2019ll dress up like\nSandy Claws, and when everybody is there and the program is about over\nwe\u2019ll have Wick at the door. _Sabe?_ Somebody will give him messages\nfrom Sandy Claws. Each message will show that he\u2019s that much closer.\nEverybody gets excited, don\u2019t yuh see, and at the right time I comes\nin. Fine, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI seconds the motion,\u201d says the judge, \u201cI remember when I was a\nkid\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI thirds it,\u201d states Testament. \u201cShe\u2019s a pious method, Tellurium.\nBeats having Sandy come down the chimbley.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Magpie, weary-like, \u201cgo ahead and do what yuh like, but I\nwant this tab-lew to be just like I sees it. Testament, will yuh look\nup something for the wise men to say, and how we wants \u2019em to dress?\u201d\n\n\u201cYea, verily I will, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make me some whiskers out of a horse\u2019s tail,\u201d says Tellurium.\n\n\u201cI hope the horse sees yuh takin\u2019 them,\u201d says Magpie.\n\nThen the meeting broke up, and we adjourned to Buck\u2019s place.\n\nScenery is tickled stiff to think he\u2019s goin\u2019 to be a actor, but I\nain\u2019t cheering\u2014yet. Me and Dirty Shirt are veterans in this acting\ngame, and we knows it takes nerve, speed and a strong constitution.\n\nThe old Romans and their wild animal arena never had nothing of\nPiperock. She\u2019s a place where milk comes in tin cans, and the only\nhoney is what the sand-hornets puts up for their own use. Her motto\nis:\n\n\u201cHurrah for \u2014\u2014! Who\u2019s afraid of a little fire?\u201d\n\nIn Buck\u2019s place we finds Muley and Chuck, and pretty soon Telescope\nTolliver and Henry Peck comes in, which makes the Cross J quartet\ncomplete.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t let us sing, Telescope,\u201d says Muley, sad-like.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t?\u201d says Telescope, surprized. \u201cWon\u2019t let us sing?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a note. Not only that but they insults us a heap.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Henry Peck. \u201cWell, the nerve of the pelicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame us,\u201d says Dirty Shirt. \u201cWe ain\u2019t got a danged thing to do\nwith it\u2014not even the disposition of our own re-mains after the\nmassacree is over.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t let us sing,\u201d repeats Telescope. \u201cWhatcha know about\nthat?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even sing free,\u201d admits Chuck, wiggling his ears real fast. \u201cIt\nain\u2019t reasonable. Why, they won\u2019t have no music a-tall. Bill\nThatcher\u2019s orchestra ain\u2019t comin\u2019. Bill said it cost him a new bull\nfiddle and a drum every time he played here, and he\u2019s savin\u2019 up to buy\na slip-horn.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to be glad,\u201d says Dirty Shirt. \u201cYou sure ought to, boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a insult to harmony,\u201d says Telescope. \u201cWe\u2019ve almost got to the\npoint where we can sing \u2018Tentin\u2019 Tonight,\u2019 with variations, and our\n\u2018Sweet Marie\u2019 sure does make the shivers run up your spine. \u2018Jay Bird\u2019\nWhittaker says it\u2019s got anything beat he ever heard since he busted\nthe ear tubes of his talkin\u2019 machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a act does you perform, Dirty?\u201d asks Hen Feck.\n\n\u201cI portrays Wisdom,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cThere\u2019s three of us, Hennery, three\nof a kind against a full house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWisdom,\u201d proclaims Muley, \u201cWisdom consists of more than three things,\nDirty. No three men can portray wisdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 to give her a try, Muley. Me and Ike and Scenery.\u201d\n\n\u201cWisdom\u2014!\u201d grunts Telescope. \u201cYou three?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Maud S,\u201d adds Dirty, sad-like.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Chuck. \u201cOh, yeah. Well, mebbe you\u2019ll get away with it.\u201d\n\nAccording to all we can find out, Christmas is the time of peace on\nearth and plenty of good-will to everybody. She\u2019s a time when the lion\nand the lamb lies down together, and the cowpuncher forgets that there\nis such a thing as a sheep-herder. It\u2019s a time when men\u2019s hearts are\nfilled with love toward their fellermen, and a six-shooter is only a\nornament; a time, when you can say, \u201cYoo-hoo\u201d to a horse-thief,\nwithout expecting to grab a harp the next minute.\n\n\u201cYea, verily,\u201d as Testament says. \u201cIt is a time when grown men become\nlike little children. Yeah, that\u2019s a fact\u2014mentally. Piperock ain\u2019t got\nany too much sense when she\u2019s acting growed up; but right now\u2014huh!\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere ain\u2019t no reason why a lot of disreputable snake-hunters can\u2019t\nspend their Christmas in Paradise or Curlew; but they don\u2019t. Nope.\nThey clutters up Piperock to partake of our good cheer. Me and Dirty\nlooks over that aggregation of incompetents, and the sight drives all\nwisdom, peace and good will from our hearts.\n\n\u201cBig Foot\u201d Forrest, \u201cCactus\u201d Collins, \u201cMex\u201d Mason, \u201cPole-Cat\u201d Perkins,\n\u201cHaw\u201d Harris, et cettery, running the gamut of undesirable\nhorse-thieves. \u201cHassayampa\u201d Harris, who is a uncle of \u201cHaw,\u201d brings\nhis bunch of hard-boiled punchers over from Curlew, and Mike Pelly\nheads the aggregation of incompetents from Paradise.\n\nThe Seven A, Triangle, Five Dot, Circle C and the Cross J all cometh\nto hive up in Piperock and partake of the Christmas cheer, and\neverything else that might come to pass. They\u2019ve got the Mint Hall\ndecorated for the occasion, and so forth. They built the stage out\nuntil she\u2019s about twenty feet square, and about five feet high.\n\nA couple of horse-thieves, who studied art in the penitentiary,\npainted the scenery. It\u2019s canvas hung at the back of the stage, and\nthey painted it black and put on a lot of white stars. Sticking in the\nmiddle of the canvas is kind of a lantern rigging, with a round glass\nin it and a lamp inside.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the moon,\u201d explains Magpie. \u201cWhen this is pulled off that will\nbe the only visible light. _Sabe?_ Desert, yuh understand? We\u2019re goin\u2019\nto put some rocks and a bunch of cactus on the stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d squeaks Scenery.\n\n\u201cYou will be asleep,\u201d explains Testament. \u201cThe lamp will be turned low\nand have a cover over it. Everything will be still. I\u2019ll have somebody\nbehind the curtain to take off the cover of the moon, and slowly turn\nup the lamp. One of you wise men wakes up and sees the dim light. You\nwakes up the rest of the bunch, and you all stands up, looking at the\nlight.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2014Magpie. I reckon we better have the mule layin\u2019 down, hadn\u2019t\nwe? Well, you wakes up the mule, and then you all starts walking\nslow-like toward the back of the stage, and then we drops the curtain.\nThat\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to throw that mule,\u201d opines Wick. \u201cBetter hawg-tie it,\ntoo, and let somebody cut the ropes when they\u2019re ready to go. The\nhumps are all ready to be cinched on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we wear?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cMy wife is makin\u2019 the costumes out of gunny-sacks,\u201d says Wick.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have something what looks like presents,\u201d opines\nTestament. \u201cI\u2019ve got a picture, which shows a lot of vases and stuff\nlike that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s got some stuff that will be just the cheese,\u201d says Wick.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use some of her chiny vases.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we have to say?\u201d asks Scenery.\n\n\u201cIke will do the sayin\u2019,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cHe\u2019ll be the one what wakes up\nfirst and he will say\u2014uh\u2014what was it, Testament?\u201d\n\n\u201cLo, there shineth a bright light. Let\u2019s go to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy\u2014\u2014!\u201d gasps Dirty Shirt, pious-like. \u201cBut save the wimmin and\nchildren first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sure goin\u2019 to be a wonderful thing, and will teach a moral,\u201d\nsays Testament.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says I. \u201cAnd the moral is: Let well enough alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d ought to say them words,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cI think a thing like\nthat needs appropriate gestures, and I\u2019ve studied\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMight be better,\u201d says Wick. \u201cGestures helps a lot. Remember Willyum\nJennins Bryan, when he was preachin\u2019 fer silver. If Scenery would sort\nof loosen up his vocal cords a little\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLet him say \u2019em,\u201d says I. \u201cI\u2019d hate to pass out with them words on my\nlips. Scenery, you\u2019re elected.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cI\u2019ll study up my ellie-cushun a little.\nFeller gets kinda rusty, you know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d admits Magpie, \u201cand kinda squeaks. You don\u2019t need study\u2014you\nneed some kerosene and then a application of axle-grease, Scenery.\u201d\n\nThe next morning we took Maud S up the steps into the hall, and I\u2019m\nhere to say that Maud S made life miserable for us. A mule is hard to\nargue with on the level, but try getting one half-way up a stairs and\nhave it stop to think. We took Maud S in sitting down, bucked her onto\nthe stage, where she lays down and refuses to get up.\n\n\u201cFine!\u201d says Wick. We \u201cwon\u2019t have to hawg-tie her.\u201d\n\n\u201cStage fright,\u201d opines Magpie.\n\n\u201cSafety first,\u201d says I. \u201cAnimals have instincts, and hers is to get\nbelow the line of fire.\u201d\n\nMe and Dirty meets the Cross J quartet, and they\u2019re getting cheerful.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Muley, \u201cwe ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to no celebrashun. They have done us\ndirt and we sickens to our soul at their per-fid-i-tee.\u201d\n\n\u201cSheveral per-fid-i-tees,\u201d nods Telescope. \u201cGroup aroun\u2019 me while we\nshing a shong of gladness over the merry Chris\u2019mas time. All together\nnow:\n\n    \u201cOh, the coyote said, I\u2019m better than a puncher,\n      With a gun that goes blam, blam!\n    He may die and go up to heaven,\n      But his skin ain\u2019t worth a \u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure does get into the Christmas spirit,\u201d opines Dirty. \u201cThat\u2019s\none of the sweetest things I ever heard.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen I calls Dirty outside, and I says to him, like this:\n\n\u201cDirty, me and you have got to stay sober. A drunk ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to have\nno chance a-tall in there if anything goes wrong. If we hangs around\nwith them celebratin\u2019 shorthorns we won\u2019t be in no shape to get up and\nfoller that star. We\u2019ll be just like Maud S, which can\u2019t or won\u2019t get\nup.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Ike. We\u2019ll get a couple of quarts for ourselves and\nkeep away from them hard drinkers. Don\u2019t yuh reckon Maud S will get up\nat the right time?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s plumb rooted, Dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. I know how to do it, Ike. Come on.\u201d\n\nDirty went over to Wick\u2019s store, and later on I meets him; and we goes\nup to my cabin.\n\nWe\u2019ve got them two quarts of hooch, so we has quite a little time of\nour own, waiting until the afternoon gets to the sere and yaller leaf.\nI wakes up and finds Dirty with flour all over his clothes, but he\nwon\u2019t tell what he\u2019s trying to do.\n\nMagpie hunts us up and acts peevish toward us.\n\n\u201cGosh a\u2019mighty,\u201d he complains. \u201cAin\u2019t yuh got no sense? We\u2019re tryin\u2019\nto re-hearse and you fellers hide out down here. Come on.\u201d\n\nWe just gets to the door, when we meets Muley Bowles.\n\n\u201cF\u2019r th\u2019 lasht time\u2014do we shing?\u201d asks Muley.\n\n\u201cYou do not!\u201d declares Magpie. \u201cI thought you knowed that, Muley.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay you resht in peash,\u201d says Muley. \u201cMay your anchestors rise up and\nmock you for bein\u2019 a \u2014\u2014 fool. Autographically schpeakin\u2019:\n\n    \u201cMay your hair wear out\n      And your nose break off\n    And your teeth shake loose\n      From whoopin\u2019 cough.\n\n\u201cThish is the best wishes of your friend Muley Bowels, E-squire,\nDecember twenty-fourth.\u201d\n\n\u201cTha\u2019s good,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Roshes are blue, vi\u2019lets are\npink\u2014uh\u2014no, that ain\u2019t it. Vi\u2019lets are red and roshes are blue\u2014Haw!\nHaw! Haw! No knife can cut our love up. Haw! Haw! Haw!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say something, Ike?\u201d asks Magpie. \u201cYou\u2019re just as drunk\nas they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m mean drunk, Magpie. There ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 flowery about\nme. I ain\u2019t in no mood to wish whoopin\u2019 cough nor violets on mine\nenemies. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\u201cSufferin\u2019 sun-fish!\u201d grunts Magpie. \u201cLook at Rip Van Winkle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me\u2014Tellurium,\u201d says the apparition. \u201cDon\u2019t I look it?\u201d\n\nHe sure did. He\u2019s got a old bear-skin overcoat on, and about three\nstrings of sleigh-bells around his waist. He\u2019s got a stove-pipe hat on\nhis head and on his chin is a bunch of whiskers made from the tail of\na white horse. Personally, I think he\u2019s the dangest-looking thing I\never saw.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Magpie, \u201cyou sure look it, Tellurium, but I\u2019m danged if I\nknow what you do look like.\u201d\n\n\u201cSandy Claws,\u201d says Tellurium, proud-like. \u201cI\u2019m him. Come up to show\nyou what can be done when you\u2019ve got the ambition.\u201d\n\n\u201cSandy Claws?\u201d says Magpie. \u201cNo, no Tellurium. Sandy Claws don\u2019t look\nlike that. What do yuh want to do\u2014scare folks? You look like a cross\nbetween a item of natural hist\u2019ry and a smallpox germ.\u201d\n\n\u201cI comes into the program as a sort of special thing,\u201d says Tellurium.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Magpie, \u201cnot into my program, Tellurium. You better go out\nand scare coyotes with that outfit. I ain\u2019t using no Sandy Clawses\nanyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve went to a lot of trouble,\u201d complains Tellurium.\n\n\u201cSo\u2019ve we,\u201d says Muley. \u201cHe won\u2019t let us shing, and now he don\u2019t want\nno Sandy Clawses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d make a good one, too,\u201d says Tellurium.\n\n\u201cYeah, you would\u2014not,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cI\u2019d just as soon see a wild bull\ncome in there dressed like that, Tellurium. You\u2019d ruin the show, you\nknow it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk to him,\u201d says Muley. \u201cHe has no soul, Tellurium.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t let us shing. Nossir. No Sandy Claws, no shongs\u2014where\u2019s your\nol\u2019 Christmas?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, Ike,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cLet \u2019em wail. I\u2019m goin\u2019 to pull off one\nshow that Piperock can be proud of, yuh bet your life.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe went up to Mint Hall. Mrs. Smith and Matilda Mudgett are there,\nsort of strutting around like a pair of fool-hens. Ricky Henderson,\nWick Smith and Frenchy Deschamps are there, fixing their orchestra\nseats. Wick\u2019s new drum is there, and he\u2019s some proud of it.\n\n\u201cMr. Harper,\u201d says Matilda, \u201chave you ever heard \u2018Spring, Lovely\nSpring\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot since last April,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cWe are going to render it tonight,\u201d says she.\n\n\u201cWe?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe and Mrs. Smith. She has a lovely alto.\u201d\n\nI goes over and talks to Ricky.\n\n\u201cRicky, you knows something about music\u2014what is a alto?\u201d\n\nRicky thinks deep for a while, and then he says:\n\n\u201cIke, did yuh ever let out a whoop, and then hear the same whoop come\nback to yuh? That\u2019s it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that was a echo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure; but that\u2019s only when yuh hear one reply. Sabe? When yuh\nhears two replies\u2014that\u2019s alto. It\u2019s a Hungarian word, which means\ntwo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean when you hears more than two?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s basso profundo, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thinks Maud S is paralyzed,\u201d complains Wick. \u201cShe don\u2019t seem to\nhave no use of her legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor this we offer much thanks,\u201d says Dirty.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s got to get up and go with yuh,\u201d says Wick. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave\nher layin\u2019 there on the stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll get up,\u201d declares Dirty. \u201cI know a lot about mules. Lemme\nalone and don\u2019t worry about Maud S.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t much use of rehearsin\u2019,\u201d squeaks Scenery; \u201cI\u2019m the main\nthing up there, and I\u2019ve studied my gestures a-plenty, and I know the\nwords fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to put the humps on Maud S,\u201d says Wick. \u201cWe can hang some\nstuff over the humps, so nobody will know she ain\u2019t a cam-el. You know\nhow they does in a circus, Magpie?\u201d\n\nMe and Dirty, not wishful to get the least hazy, decides to buy us\nsome more bottle cheer, instead of carousing around with the common\nherd, and we communes with each other in my cabin, until the shades of\nnight have come down upon us. Then we finds our way back to the hall.\nWe\u2019ve got a full audience\u2014in more ways than one. Doughgod Smith has\nbeen appointed door-keeper and he annexes our guns as we goes in.\n\n\u201cYuh can\u2019t take your guns in with yuh,\u201d he states. \u201cThem is orders.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s got a lot of belts and holsters, but few guns hanging on a hook.\nDirty looks \u2019em over and picks out a good-looking gun, which he shoves\ndown inside his waistband.\n\n\u201cThem orders don\u2019t say yuh can\u2019t pack a strange gun, do they?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot my orders,\u201d says Doughgod. \u201cThey tell me not to let any man in\nwith his gun, that\u2019s all. You ain\u2019t settin\u2019 no precedent, Dirty. I\nreckon every man in the hall is packin\u2019 a strange gun, but there\u2019s one\nsatisfaction\u2014they can\u2019t shoot more than six time per each, \u2019cause I\u2019ve\ngot all their extra ammunition.\u201d\n\nI picks out an old decrepid .44, and goes inside the hall. I looks\nover that congregation and I can\u2019t see where Doughgod had any reasons\nfor being cheerful. There\u2019s at least a hundred men in there, which\nmeans six hundred shots, which is usually plenty and sufficient.\n\nThe reward notices are sure well represented, and you could just about\nlynch the whole bunch and not make any mistake.\n\nWe finds the acting talent behind the curtain. Scenery is all dressed\nup in a gunny-sack gown, with a ribbon tied around his head and no\nboots on. He\u2019s making gestures like a prize-fighter.\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d gasps Dirty. \u201cWould yuh look at that?\u201d Scenery jerks one fist\noutward and upward, swings the other arm behind him, like he was\nguarding his rear, and then squeaks:\n\n\u201cLo, there shineth a bright light. Let\u2019s go to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMark an X after Scenery Sims,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cHe won\u2019t last.\u201d\n\nWe goes over where Wick is looking at Maud S. She\u2019s still laying down\nand don\u2019t act like she\u2019s ever get up again.\n\n\u201c\u2019Fraid she\u2019s on her last legs,\u201d says Wick. \u201cYessir, I reckon we\u2019re\ngoin\u2019 to lose Maudie.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Fraid?\u201d snorts Mrs. Smith. \u201cThat de-eared hay-hound? Let her die.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot until she\u2019s been a ca-mel, maw,\u201d says Wick, and then he goes out\nto set down beside his new drum.\n\nDirty sets down beside Maud S and takes her head in his lap.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t the Cross J quartet going to sing?\u201d asks Matilda.\n\nOld Testament shakes his head.\n\n\u201cNope. They got mad\u2014them and Tellurium. They all went home.\u201d\n\n\u201cTweet, tweet, tweet,\u201d goes the flute.\n\n\u201cBum! Bum! Bum!\u201d goes the drum.\n\n\u201cWhar-r-r-oo-o-o-o-o-m-m-m-m,\u201d goes the jew\u2019s-harp.\n\n\u201cThe orchestra is tunin\u2019 up,\u201d observes Dirty. \u201cWe ain\u2019t got long to\nlive, Ike.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen old Judge Steele steps out through the curtain, and the hum of\nconversation dies down.\n\n\u201cFeller citizens and ladies,\u201d says the judge, \u201cthe first thing on the\nprogram is a du-it. Miss Mudgett is going to sing \u2018Spring, Lovely\nSpring,\u2019 with the kind assistance of Mrs. Smith. This here is a\nsoup-ranner and alter du-it. We asks yuh to bear with the orchestra to\nthe limit of your patience, as this is their first appearance\ntogether.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d asks Big Foot Forrest.\n\n\u201cAll of \u2019em. They\u2019re acquainted, but that\u2019s about all you can say for\n\u2019em. All right, Wick\u2014let her go.\u201d\n\n\u201cTweet, tweet, tweet! Bum, bum, bum, bum! Whar-r-r-oo-o-o-m-m-m-m!\u201d\n\nMrs. Smith and Matilda goes out through the curtain. Somebody laughs\nout loud and then comes a thud.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014go ahead,\u201d says Hair Oil Heppner\u2019s voice. \u201cBig Foot thought\nhe saw somethin\u2019 funny, but he\u2019s forgot what it was.\u201d\n\nThe song starts and this is how she sounds:\n\n\u201cTweet, bum, Spree-e-e-hing, lovely spree-e-e-hing, tweet, tweet, bum,\nwhar-r-r-oo-o-m, Spree-e-hing, Spree-e-e-hing, bum, bum, kerong-g-g-g,\ntweet, tweet.\n\n\u201cYou cree-e-e-heep o\u2019er me-e-e-adhows be-e-e-e-right,\nwhar-r-r-room-m-m, bum, bum, tweet, tweet, o\u2019er me-e-e-adhows\nbe-e-e-right, bum, bum, bum, tweet, tweedle, wharoom, whar-r-r-oom\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa, Blaze!\u201d\n\nI whirls just in time to see Magpie get kicked behind the knees by\nMaud S, who is laying down. She must \u2019a\u2019 just sort of cramped herself\nand then let fly with both hoofs.\n\nMagpie turns plumb over and goes out through the curtain and right\ninto Mrs. Smith, who is straining over \u201cbe-e-e-right;\u201d and when they\nhit the platform she\u2019s on top.\n\n\u201cFrom Spring to Fall!\u201d yelps Mex Mason.\n\nMrs. Smith gets off poor Magpie, and lets out a wail:\n\n\u201cO-o-o-o-o-o-oh! Every time I try to do something, some hammer-head\ncomes bustin\u2019 along and spoils it!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you hit her on purpose?\u201d demands Wick, standing up.\n\n\u201cYour \u2014\u2014 mule\u2014\u201d begins Magpie, foolish-like.\n\n\u201cYou done it on purpose!\u201d howls Mrs. Smith.\n\nWick believed her, I reckon, cause he throwed his drum stick right at\npoor Magpie. It was a good shot. It came right through the hole in the\ncurtain and it hit Judge Steele on the bridge of his nose. The old boy\nsort of got dignified acting.\n\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cWonderful cons\u2019tution.\u201d\n\nThe judge just walks around the stage, making gestures and working his\nlips, but there ain\u2019t no words. Pretty soon he stops, seems to listen,\nand then he says, soft-like: \u201cGuilty? Why, gentlemen, that man is as\ninnocent as a new-born baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnocked back seven years,\u201d says Dirty, awed-like. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\nsaid the time he was my lawyer, and that was seven years ago.\u201d\n\nThe crowd out in front are talking loud, and I know danged well that\nthere\u2019s going to be trouble if we don\u2019t keep going. Mrs. Smith comes\nwaddling in, follered by Matilda and Magpie.\n\nMrs. Smith is sore as a boil.\n\n\u201cI will not sing another note,\u201d she declares. \u201cEvery time I start to\ndo anything in public\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMaud S is getting restless,\u201d states Scenery. \u201cWe better pull off our\nact.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan yuh get her up at the right time, Dirty?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cGet things set, and I\u2019ll do my dangest.\u201d\n\nThen they cleared everybody away, while we got ready. Me and Dirty and\nScenery are all dressed in them gunny-sack gowns, and have got our\nboots off.\n\nThey\u2019ve got a big bunch of cactus and a lot of rocks, which they puts\naround to make it look like a desert. Pete Gonyer is behind the back\ncurtain, ready to take the cover off the moon, and then turn up the\nlamp. Maud S is making funny noises in her throat, but Dirty is\nsetting on her head.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cSpeed-crazy,\u201d grins Dirty.\n\n\u201cGet ready,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cNow, for gosh sakes, make this look real.\u201d\n\nThey blew out all the lights except one in the back of the room, and\nthen pulled the curtain.\n\n\u201cWhat does she represent\u2014a load of dirt?\u201d asks Pole-Cat Perkins.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a \u2014\u2014 of a thing to ride thirty miles to see,\u201d opines \u201cWindy\u201d\nWilkins.\n\n\u201cWhere is the moon?\u201d squeaks Scenery, in a whisper. \u201cPete, where in \u2014\u2014\nare yuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, \u2014\u2014!\u201d groans Pete. \u201cMagpie, did yuh turn out this lamp?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was lit when I left there!\u201d snaps Magpie. \u201cYou must \u2019a\u2019 blowed on\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never blowed on nothin\u2019!\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw! Haw!\u201d roars Art Miller. \u201cThis is one funny game. Like a\nminstrel show. Pete, ask him why he thinks yuh blowed on it.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nComes a little bit of light, and I feels Scenery climb to his feet.\nThere he stands in the gloom, pointing up and down and sidewise, and\nthen he squeaks:\n\n\u201cLo, there bringth a slight\u2014uh\u2014slineth a bite\u2014I mean\u2014a\u2014a\u2014lineth\na\u2014let\u2019s go to it\u2014uh\u2014to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw! Haw!\u201d howls somebody. \u201cPete Gonyer\u2019s lightin\u2019 the moon!\u201d\n\nI turns and takes a look. There is Pete at the back of the stage. He\u2019s\ngot the cover off the moon, and is trying to get the old lamp to\nlight.\n\n\u201cDang it!\u201d he howls. \u201cI\u2019ve turned the wick plumb into the bottom!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa, Maud!\u201d howls Dirty. \u201cHelp me hold her, Ike!\u201d\n\nI turns, and there is Maud S standing on her hind legs, and, as I\nlook, them humps, which wasn\u2019t well cinched, being as she was laying\ndown at the time, swing down and just about fill up all the space\nbetween her front and hind legs.\n\n\u201cHo-hold her!\u201d wails Dirty; but Maud S thinks she\u2019s a circus animal.\n\nHold her? Man, that mule, after all these years, found out that she\nhad authority to go to some place. She waltzes around a couple of\ntimes, busts a hole in the stage and falls over backwards into the\norchestra.\n\nWick Smith falls over backwards, pulling his new drum over with him,\nthereby saving his part of the orchestra.\n\n\u201cWhoo-o-o-ee! Pow-w-w-w-der Ri-i-ver!\u201d yowls a puncher, and a circle\nof chairs lands around Maud S, trying to block her, but Maud S ain\u2019t\nto be stopped.\n\nShe bucked plumb over the top of Wick Smith, and that drum rattled\nagainst her heels.\n\nZowie! She telescoped and lifted that drum with both hind feet. Dirty\nShirt was just going to jump off the stage to attack her from the\nrear, and that drum caught him in midair. Dirty comes plumb back onto\nthe stage and lands setting down in that bed of cactus. The drum hit\nme in the knees, and I went plumb over the top of it and dug my chin\ninto the desert.\n\nWhen I got my senses again I sees that about seven punchers have hold\nof Maud S, and are trying to hold her.\n\n\u201cLights!\u201d yelps Wick. \u201cLight some lamps. My \u2014\u2014, my drum is busted!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014 your old drum!\u201d howls Dirty Shirt, standing on the stage, trying\nto lift the seat of his pants loose from himself.\n\n\u201cO-o-o-o-oh, the tab-lew is ruined!\u201d wails Mrs. Smith.\n\nEverybody helped light the lamps, and then we stands and looks at each\nother. Maud S looks like her course was about run, but them punchers\ndon\u2019t take any chances.\n\n\u201cSandy Claws has come!\u201d yells a voice at the door, and we all takes a\nlook. I never seen anything like that apparition. It\u2019s a two-year old\nsteer, wearing a bear-skin overcoat, with a string of sleigh-bells\naround it, and on the lower lip of the danged animal is Tellurium\nWood\u2019s false whiskers, and over one horn is that tall hat. The steer\nis about half way into the hall when we see it coming, and its tail is\ntwisted over its back. Around its mouth is twisted a rope, which is\nyanked off as it humps into the door.\n\n\u201cBa-a-a-rr!\u201d blats that steer, like it hurt all over, and right up\nthat room it comes, romping regardless of life or limb.\n\nI know it was Chuck\u2019s voice that yelled\u2014\n\n\u201cSandy Claws has come.\u201d\n\n\u201cHo-o-old fast!\u201d yells a puncher, and just then the steer lams into\npoor Maud S, scattering the punchers. Hair Oil Heppner tries to\nbulldog that locoed animal, but he might as well \u2019a\u2019 tried to bulldog\na box-car.\n\nThen Maud S gets enervated again, and things begin to boil a-plenty.\n\n\u201cBa-a-a-a-w!\u201d bawls the steer.\n\n\u201cHa-a-a-a-w!\u201d sings Maud, and the both of them starts gamboling toward\nthe stage.\n\n\u201cGit ba-a-a-ck!\u201d yowls Pete Gonyer. \u201cDaw-w-w-gone yuh, git back!\u201d\n\nRip-i-i-p! The steer gets its horns into the curtain, rips about\ntwenty feet of it loose, and starts to climb the stage.\n\nCrash! The moon went down, and the danged old oil lamp inside\nexploded.\n\n\u201cFire! Fire!\u201d howls Judge Steele, and then he picks up that blazing\nmoon and whales away at the steer with it.\n\nClank! The judge was left-handed, which might account for the poor\nthrowing, but he got his feet tangled in some of that loose curtain\nand hit Scenery Sims right in the head with that heavy moon.\n\nBang! Somebody took a shot at the steer and knocked several bells, and\none of them danged bells hit me in the nose. I hate to get hit in the\nnose with a bell. I hates to get hit in the nose with anything, but I\nsure does detest a bell. I can see folks going out of the door as fast\nas they can travel. I seen Hair Oil climbing onto poor Maud S, and\nthen my time is all taken up with that danged steer.\n\nAll this stuff is taking place a lot faster than I can tell it. I\nbulldogged that steer. It was the first steer I ever tried to bulldog,\nand if all future steers will keep away from me it will be the last.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI hooked onto his horns just in time to feel my feet dangle off the\nedge of the stage, the same of which helped my act quite a lot. The\nsteer upends from my weight, and me and that steer landed into a\njumble of chairs, and over the top of us goes Maud S, celebrating her\nsecond childhood by making Hair Oil pull leather.\n\nThe few remaining folks in the hall sort of celebrates by taking some\nshots at the lights, the same of which makes our immediate future\nkinda gloomy.\n\n\u201cLo, I see a bright light!\u201d squeals Scenery\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cSus-sunfish, you crop-eared coyote!\u201d yells Hair Oil, and then comes a\ncrash of glass.\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d yells Magpie. \u201cShe throwed Hair Oil out of the window! Where\nare you, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep away!\u201d I yells. \u201cI\u2019m paralyzed all the way down from my upper\nlip and I don\u2019t know whether me or the steer is on top.\u201d\n\n\u201cParalyzed \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014!\u201d howls Dirty. \u201cWish I was. Who in \u2014\u2014 got the idea of\nputtin\u2019 cactus on the stage?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook out for that mule!\u201d yelps Magpie, and I looks up at the dim\nfigure of that locoed mule, almost over me. I yanks away from my steer\nand the steer yanks right with me. Under ordinary conditions I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019\nbeen able to get away, but I\u2019ve got one leg through a string of them\nsleigh-bells, and when that steer starts for the door, Ike Harper\nE-squire went right along\u2014on the back of his neck.\n\nI hooked a lot of chairs on my way, kinda trying to impede the hoofs\nof progress, but that scared steer made funny little noises and keeps\ngoing. There\u2019s a lantern hung at the head of the stairs, and I reckon\nthe steer was hunting for light.\n\nJust before we hits the top of the stairs I hears a strain of quartet\nmusic:\n\n\u201cTentin\u2019 to-o-o-o-night, tentin\u2019 to-o-o\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nCrash!\n\nWe hit the doorway with our assortment of furniture, and the next\nthing I know I\u2019m amid more feller mortals and we\u2019re all traveling the\ndownward path. I sees some red, white and blue lights, and I\u2019m loose.\nI reckon the bell strap busted. I gets to my feet, dodging stars and\nother aerial impediments, when the stairs almost shakes out from under\nme, and I gets a glimpse of Maud S falling downstairs.\n\nFolks, I jumped\u2014but too late. Me and Maud S landed at the bottom\ntogether. I grabs the mule with both hands, and I feels her get up\nwith me hanging to some part of her anatomy. It\u2019s about twenty feet\nfrom the bottom of the stairs to the door, and I rode some part of\nthat crop-eared mule as far as the exit, where the top of the door\nslapped me in the face and I went into the land of Once Upon a Time.\n\nI\u2019m just about to live happy ever afterwards, when something seems to\nwake me up. I feels a dragging sensation, along with other painful\nthings, and then I dimly hears Dirty Shirt say\u2014\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta help me, Muley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotta have a little help myself,\u201d wails Muley. \u201cI tell yuh that\ndanged steer knocked me down and then the mule fell over me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut poor old Ike is de-e-e-ad!\u201d sobs Dirty.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll keep,\u201d croaks Muley; \u201cbut I\u2019ll spoil if I don\u2019t have help.\u201d\n\n\u201cYuh gotta help me drag him home, Muley. You was to blame for his\nde-mise.\u201d\n\n\u201cNaw, I wasn\u2019t, Dirty. Chuck got the idea of dressin\u2019 up that steer in\nTellurium\u2019s clothes. Tellurium was sore, too. We twisted a wire around\nthe steer\u2019s tail to make it bawl when the gag was pulled off.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to make it blat at Magpie. Nossir, yuh can\u2019t blame us\nfor it, \u2019cause that mule would \u2019a\u2019 killed him anyway. I\u2019d like to know\nwhat in \u2014\u2014 woke up that gone-to-seed mule.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t nobody to hear,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cso I\u2019ll tell yuh. I took a\ncan of red pepper and a can of ginger and mixed \u2019em. Then I made a gob\nof dough in Dee\u2019s shack and put the hot stuff in the middle. _Sabe?_\nMaud S. swallered it. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d kill us if they knew,\u201d groans Dirty.\n\n\u201cDeath\u2019s stinger wouldn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d groans Muley.\n\nI crawls to my feet, and they don\u2019t see me until I\u2019m standing up\nbeside \u2019em.\n\n\u201cYou\u2014you\u2014uh\u2014\u201d stammers Dirty. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell, w-will yuh, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t you dead\u2014yet?\u201d gasps Muley.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d says I, \u201cenough to foller out the old saying\u2014dead men tell\nno tales. I\u2019ve got eyesight enough left to see the lights of Buck\u2019s\nplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cL-let\u2019s go tut-to it,\u201d stammers Dirty.\n\nWhich shows that Piperock never started anything that they couldn\u2019t\nfinish\u2014after a fashion.\n",
