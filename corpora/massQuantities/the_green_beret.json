    "body": "\n     _It's not so much the decisions a man does make that mark\n     him as a Man--but the ones he refrains from making. Like the\n     decision \"I've had enough!\"_\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead locked the door and drew his pistol. Sergeant Rashid handed\nPremier Umluana the warrant.\n\n\"We're from the UN Inspector Corps,\" Sergeant Rashid said. \"I'm\nvery sorry, but we have to arrest you and bring you in for trial\nby the World Court.\"\n\nIf Umluana noticed Read's gun, he didn't show it. He read the\nwarrant carefully. When he finished, he said something in Dutch.\n\n\"I don't know your language,\" Rashid said.\n\n\"Then I'll speak English.\" Umluana was a small man with wrinkled\nbrow, glasses and a mustache. His skin was a shade lighter than\nRead's. \"The Inspector General doesn't have the power to arrest a\nhead of state--especially the Premier of Belderkan. Now, if\nyou'll excuse me, I must return to my party.\"\n\nIn the other room people laughed and talked. Glasses clinked in\nthe late afternoon. Read knew two armed men stood just outside\nthe door. \"If you leave, Premier, I'll have to shoot you.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Umluana said. \"No, if you kill me, all Africa\nwill rise against the world. You don't want me dead. You want me\nin court.\"\n\nRead clicked off the safety.\n\n\"Corporal Read is very young,\" Rashid said, \"but he's a crack\nshot. That's why I brought him with me. I think he _likes_ to\nshoot, too.\"\n\nUmluana turned back to Rashid a second too soon. He saw the\nsergeant's upraised hand before it collided with his neck.\n\n\"Help! _Kidnap._\"\n\nRashid judo chopped him and swung the inert body over his\nshoulders. Read pulled a flat grenade from his vest pocket. He\ndropped it and yellow psycho gas hissed from the valve.\n\n\"Let's be off,\" Rashid said.\n\nThe door lock snapped as they went out the window. Two men with\nrifles plunged into the gas; sighing, they fell to the floor in a\ncatatonic trance.\n\nA little car skimmed across the lawn. Bearing the Scourge of\nAfrica, Rashid struggled toward it. Read walked backward,\ncovering their retreat.\n\nThe car stopped, whirling blades holding it a few inches off the\nlawn. They climbed in.\n\n\"How did it go?\" The driver and another inspector occupied the\nfront seat.\n\n\"They'll be after us in half a minute.\"\n\nThe other inspector carried a light machine gun and a box of\ngrenades. \"I better cover,\" he said.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Rashid said.\n\nThe inspector slid out of the car and ran to a clump of bushes.\nThe driver pushed in the accelerator. As they swerved toward the\nsouth, Read saw a dozen armed men run out of the house. A grenade\narced from the bushes and the pursuers recoiled from the cloud\nthat rose before them.\n\n\"Is he all right?\" the driver asked.\n\n\"I don't think I hurt him.\" Rashid took a syrette from his vest\npocket. \"Well, Read, it looks like we're in for a fight. In a few\nminutes Miaka Station will know we're coming. And God knows what\nwill happen at the Game Preserve.\"\n\nRead wanted to jump out of the car. He could die any minute. But\nhe had set his life on a well-oiled track and he couldn't get off\nuntil they reached Geneva.\n\n\"They don't know who's coming,\" he said. \"They don't make them\ntough enough to stop this boy.\"\n\nStaring straight ahead, he didn't see the sergeant smile.\n\n\n\nTwo types of recruits are accepted by the UN Inspector Corps:\nthose with a fanatic loyalty to the ideals of peace and world\norder, and those who are loyal to nothing but themselves. Read\nwas the second type.\n\nA tall, lanky Negro he had spent his school days in one of the\ndrab suburbs that ring every prosperous American city. It was the\nhome of factory workers, clerks, semiskilled technicians, all who\ndo the drudge work of civilization and know they will never do\nmore. The adults spent their days with television, alcohol and\ndrugs; the young spent their days with gangs, sex, television and\nalcohol. What else was there? Those who could have told him\nneither studied nor taught at his schools. What he saw on the\nconcrete fields between the tall apartment houses marked the\nlimits of life's possibilities.\n\nHe had belonged to a gang called The Golden Spacemen. \"Nobody\nfools with me,\" he bragged. \"When Harry Read's out, there's a\ntiger running loose.\" No one knew how many times he nearly ran\nfrom other clubs, how carefully he picked the safest spot on the\nbattle line.\n\n\"A man ought to be a man,\" he once told a girl. \"He ought to do a\nman's work. Did you ever notice how our fathers look, how they\nsleep so much? I don't want to be like that. I want to be\nsomething proud.\"\n\nHe joined the UN Inspector Corps at eighteen, in 1978. The\ninternational cops wore green berets, high buttonless boots, bush\njackets. They were very special men.\n\nFor the first time in his life, his father said something about\nhis ambitions.\n\n\"Don't you like America, Harry? Do you _want_ to be without a\ncountry? This is the best country in the world. All my life I've\nmade a good living. Haven't you had everything you ever wanted?\nI've been a king compared to people overseas. Why, you stay here\nand go to trade school and in two years you'll be living just\nlike me.\"\n\n\"I don't want that,\" Read said.\n\n\"What do you mean, you don't want that?\"\n\n\"You could join the American Army,\" his mother said. \"That's as\ngood as a trade school. If you have to be a soldier.\"\n\n\"I want to be a UN man. I've already enlisted. I'm in! What do\nyou care what I do?\"\n\nThe UN Inspector Corps had been founded to enforce the Nuclear\nDisarmament Treaty of 1966. Through the years it had acquired\nother jobs. UN men no longer went unarmed. Trained to use small\narms and gas weapons, they guarded certain borders, bodyguarded\ndiplomats and UN officials, even put down riots that threatened\ninternational peace. As the UN evolved into a strong world\ngovernment, the UN Inspector Corps steadily acquired new powers.\n\nRead went through six months training on Madagascar.\n\nTwice he nearly got expelled for picking fights with smaller men.\nRather than resign, he accepted punishment which assigned him to\nweeks of dull, filthy extra labor. He hated the restrictions and\nthe iron fence of regulations. He hated boredom, loneliness and\nisolation.\n\nAnd yet he responded with enthusiasm. They had given him a job. A\njob many people considered important.\n\nHe took his turn guarding the still disputed borders of Korea. He\nserved on the rescue teams that patrol the busy Polar routes. He\nmounted guard at the 1980 World's Fair in Rangoon.\n\n\"I liked Rangoon,\" he even told a friend. \"I even liked Korea.\nBut I think I liked the Pole job best. You sit around playing\ncards and shooting the bull and then there's a plane crash or\nsomething and you go out and win a medal. That's great for me.\nI'm lazy and I like excitement.\"\n\n\n\nOne power implied in the UN Charter no Secretary General or\nInspector General had ever tried to use. The power to arrest any\nhead of state whose country violated international law. Could the\nWorld Court try and imprison a politician who had conspired to\nattack another nation?\n\nFor years Africa had been called \"The South America of the Old\nWorld.\" Revolution followed revolution. Colonies became\ndemocracies. Democracies became dictatorships or dissolved in\ncivil war. Men planted bases on the moon and in four years,\n1978-82, ringed the world with matter transmitters; but the black\npopulation of Africa still struggled toward political equality.\n\nUmluana took control of Belderkan in 1979. The tiny, former Dutch\ncolony, had been a tottering democracy for ten years. The very\nday he took control the new dictator and his African party began\nto build up the Belderkan Army. For years he had preached a new\nAfrica, united, free of white masters, the home of a vigorous and\nperfect Negro society. His critics called him a hypocritical\nracist, an opportunist using the desires of the African people to\nbuild himself an empire.\n\nHe began a propaganda war against neighboring South Africa,\npromising the liberation of that strife-torn land. Most Negro\nleaders, having just won representation in the South African\nParliament, told him to liberate his own country. They believed\nthey could use their first small voice in the government to win\ntrue freedom for their people.\n\nBut the radio assault and the arms buildup continued. Early in\n1982, South Africa claimed the Belderkan Army exceeded the size\nagreed to in the Disarmament Treaty. The European countries and\nsome African nations joined in the accusation. China called the\nuproar a vicious slur on a new African nation. The United States\nand Russia, trying not to get entangled, asked for more\ninvestigation by the UN.\n\nBut the evidence was clear. Umluana was defying world law. If he\ngot away with it, some larger and more dangerous nation might\nfollow his precedent. And the arms race would begin again.\n\nThe Inspector General decided. They would enter Belderkan, arrest\nUmluana and try him by due process before the World Court. If the\nplan succeeded, mankind would be a long step farther from nuclear\nwar.\n\nRead didn't know much about the complicated political reasons for\nthe arrest. He liked the Corp and he liked being in the Corp. He\nwent where they sent him and did what they told him to do.\n\n\n\nThe car skimmed above the tree-tops. The driver and his two\npassengers scanned the sky.\n\nA plane would have been a faster way to get out of the country.\nBut then they would have spent hours flying over Africa, with\nBelderkan fighters in hot pursuit, other nations joining the\nchase and the world uproar gaining volume. By transmitter, if all\nwent well, they could have Umluana in Geneva in an hour.\n\nThey were racing toward Miaka, a branch transmitter station. From\nMiaka they would transmit to the Belderkan Preserve, a famous\ntourist attraction whose station could transmit to any point on\nthe globe. Even now a dozen inspectors were taking over the Game\nPreserve station and manning its controls.\n\nThey had made no plans to take over Miaka. They planned to get\nthere before it could be defended.\n\n\"There's no military base near Miaka,\" Rashid said. \"We might get\nthere before the Belderkans.\"\n\n\"Here comes our escort,\" Read said.\n\nA big car rose from the jungle. This one had a recoilless rifle\nmounted on the roof. The driver and the gunner waved and fell in\nbehind them.\n\n\"One thing,\" Read said, \"I don't think they'll shoot at us while\n_he's_ in the car.\"\n\n\"Don't be certain, corporal. All these strong-arm movements are\nalike. I'll bet Umluana's lieutenants are hoping he'll become a\ndead legend. Then they can become live conquerors.\"\n\nSergeant Rashid came from Cairo. He had degrees in science and\nhistory from Cambridge but only the Corp gave him work that\nsatisfied his conscience. He hated war. It was that simple.\n\nRead looked back. He saw three spots of sunlight about two\nhundred feet up and a good mile behind.\n\n\"Here they come, Sarge.\"\n\nRashid turned his head. He waved frantically. The two men in the\nother car waved back.\n\n\"Shall I duck under the trees?\" the driver asked.\n\n\"Not yet. Not until we have to.\"\n\nRead fingered the machine gun he had picked up when he got in the\ncar. He had never been shot at. Twice he had faced an unarmed\nmob, but a few shots had sent them running.\n\nBirds flew screaming from their nests. Monkeys screeched and\nthrew things at the noisy, speeding cars. A little cloud of birds\nsurrounded each vehicle.\n\nThe escort car made a sharp turn and charged their pursuers. The\nbig rifle fired twice. Read saw the Belderkan cars scatter.\nSuddenly machine-gun bullets cracked and whined beside him.\n\n\"Evade,\" Rashid said. \"Don't go down.\"\n\nWithout losing any forward speed, the driver took them straight\nup. Read's stomach bounced.\n\nA shell exploded above them. The car rocked. He raised his eyes\nand saw a long crack in the roof.\n\n\"Hit the floor,\" Rashid said.\n\nThey knelt on the cramped floor. Rashid put on his gas mask and\nRead copied him. Umluana breathed like a furnace, still\nunconscious from the injection Rashid had given him.\n\n_I can't do anything_, Read thought. _They're too far away to\nshoot back. All we can do is run._\n\nThe sky was clear and blue. The jungle was a noisy bazaar of\ncolor. In the distance guns crashed. He listened to shells\nwhistle by and the whipcrack of machine-gun bullets. The car\nroller-coastered up and down. Every time a shell passed, he\ncrawled in waves down his own back.\n\nAnother explosion, this time very loud.\n\nRashid raised his eyes above the seat and looked out the rear\nwindow. \"Two left. Keep down, Read.\"\n\n\"Can't we go down?\" Read said.\n\n\"They'll get to Miaka before us.\"\n\nHe shut his eyes when he heard another loud explosion.\n\nSergeant Rashid looked out the window again. He swore bitterly in\nEnglish and Egyptian. Read raised his head. The two cars behind\nthem weren't fighting each other. A long way back the tree-tops\nburned.\n\n\"How much farther?\" Rashid said. The masks muffled their voices.\n\n\"There it is now. Shall I take us right in?\"\n\n\"I think you'd better.\"\n\n\n\nThe station was a glass diamond in a small clearing. The driver\nslowed down, then crashed through the glass walls and hovered by\nthe transmitter booth.\n\nRashid opened the door and threw out two grenades. Read jumped\nout and the two of them struggled toward the booth with Umluana.\nThe driver, pistol in hand, ran for the control panel.\n\nThere were three technicians in the station and no passengers.\nAll three panicked when the psycho gas enveloped them. They ran\nhowling for the jungle.\n\nThrough the window of his mask, Read saw their pursuers land in\nthe clearing. Machine-gun bullets raked the building. They got\nUmluana in the booth and hit the floor. Read took aim and opened\nfire on the largest car.\n\n\"Now, I can shoot back,\" he said. \"Now we'll see what they do.\"\n\n\"Are you ready, Rashid?\" yelled the driver.\n\n\"Man, get us out of here!\"\n\nThe booth door shut. When it opened, they were at the Game\nPreserve.\n\nThe station jutted from the side of a hill. A glass-walled\nwaiting room surrounded the bank of transmitter booths. Read\nlooked out the door and saw his first battlefield.\n\nDirectly in front of him, his head shattered by a bullet, a dead\ninspector lay behind an overturned couch.\n\nRead had seen dozens of training films taken during actual\nbattles or after atomic attacks. He had laughed when other\nrecruits complained. \"That's the way this world is. You people\nwith the weak stomachs better get used to it.\"\n\nNow he slid against the rear wall of the transmitter booth.\n\nA wounded inspector crawled across the floor to the booth. Read\ncouldn't see his wound, only the pain scratched on his face and\nthe blood he deposited on the floor.\n\n\"Did you get Umluana?\" he asked Sergeant Rashid.\n\n\"He's in the booth. What's going on?\" Rashid's Middle East Oxford\nseemed more clipped than ever.\n\n\"They hit us with two companies of troops a few minutes ago. I\nthink half our men are wounded.\"\n\n\"Can we get out of here?\"\n\n\"They machine-gunned the controls.\"\n\nRashid swore. \"You heard him, Read! Get out there and help those\nmen.\"\n\nHe heard the screams of the wounded, the crack of rifles and\nmachine guns, all the terrifying noise of war. But since his\neighteenth year he had done everything his superiors told him to\ndo.\n\nHe started crawling toward an easy-chair that looked like good\ncover. A bullet cracked above his head, so close he felt the\nshock wave. He got up, ran panicky, crouched, and dove behind the\nchair.\n\nAn inspector cracked the valve on a smoke grenade. A white fog\nspread through the building. They could see anyone who tried to\nrush them but the besiegers couldn't pick out targets.\n\nAbove the noise, he heard Rashid.\n\n\"I'm calling South Africa Station for a copter. It's the only way\nout of here. Until it comes, we've got to hold them back.\"\n\nRead thought of the green beret he had stuffed in his pocket that\nmorning. He stuck it on his head and cocked it. He didn't need\nplain clothes anymore and he wanted to wear at least a part of\nhis uniform.\n\nBullets had completely shattered the wall in front of him. He\nstared through the murk, across the broken glass. He was Corporal\nHarry Read, UN Inspector Corps--a very special man. If he didn't\ndo a good job here, he wasn't the man he claimed to be. This\nmight be the only real test he would ever face.\n\n\n\nHe heard a shout in rapid French. He turned to his right. Men in\nred loincloths ran zigzagging toward the station. They carried\nlight automatic rifles. Half of them wore gas masks.\n\n\"Shoot the masks,\" he yelled. \"Aim for the masks.\"\n\nThe machine gun kicked and chattered on his shoulder. He picked a\ntarget and squeezed off a burst. Tensely, he hunted for another\nmask. Three grenades arced through the air and yellow gas spread\nacross the battlefield. The attackers ran through it. A few yards\nbeyond the gas, some of them turned and ran for their own lines.\nIn a moment only half a dozen masked men still advanced. The\ninspectors fired a long, noisy volley. When they stopped only\nfour attackers remained on their feet. And they were running for\ncover.\n\nThe attackers had come straight up a road that led from the Game\nPreserve to the station. They had not expected any resistance.\nThe UN men had already taken over the station, chased out the\npassengers and technicians and taken up defense positions; they\nhad met the Belderkans with a dozen grenades and sent them\nscurrying for cover. The fight so far had been vicious but\ndisorganized. But the Belderkans had a few hundred men and knew\nthey had wrecked the transmitter controls.\n\nThe first direct attack had been repulsed. They could attack many\nmore times and continue to spray the building with bullets. They\ncould also try to go around the hill and attack the station from\nabove; if they did, the inspectors had a good view of the hill\nand should see them going up.\n\nThe inspectors had taken up good defensive positions. In spite of\ntheir losses, they still had enough firepower to cover the area\nsurrounding the station.\n\nRead surveyed his sector of fire. About two hundred yards to his\nleft, he saw the top of a small ditch. Using the ditch for cover,\nthe Belderkans could sneak to the top of the hill.\n\nGas grenades are only three inches long. They hold cubic yards of\ngas under high pressure. Read unclipped a telescoping rod from\nhis vest pocket. He opened it and a pair of sights flipped up. A\nthin track ran down one side.\n\nHe had about a dozen grenades left, three self-propelling. He\nslid an SP grenade into the rod's track and estimated windage and\nrange. Sighting carefully, not breathing, muscles relaxed, the\nrod rock steady, he fired and lobbed the little grenade into the\nditch. He dropped another grenade beside it.\n\nThe heavy gas would lie there for hours.\n\nSergeant Rashid ran crouched from man to man. He did what he\ncould to shield the wounded.\n\n\"Well, corporal, how are you?\"\n\n\"Not too bad, sergeant. See that ditch out there? I put a little\ngas in it.\"\n\n\"Good work. How's your ammunition?\"\n\n\"A dozen grenades. Half a barrel of shells.\"\n\n\"The copter will be here in half an hour. We'll put Umluana on,\nthen try to save ourselves. Once he's gone, I think we ought to\nsurrender.\"\n\n\"How do you think they'll treat us?\"\n\n\"That we'll have to see.\"\n\nAn occasional bullet cracked and whined through the misty room.\nNear him a man gasped frantically for air. On the sunny field a\nwounded man screamed for help.\n\n\"There's a garage downstairs,\" Rashid said. \"In case the copter\ndoesn't get here on time, I've got a man filling wine bottles\nwith gasoline.\"\n\n\"We'll stop them, Sarge. Don't worry.\"\n\n\n\nRashid ran off. Read stared across the green land and listened to\nthe pound of his heart. What were the Belderkans planning? A mass\nfrontal attack? To sneak in over the top of the hill?\n\nHe didn't think, anymore than a rabbit thinks when it lies hiding\nfrom the fox or a panther thinks when it crouches on a branch\nabove the trail. His skin tightened and relaxed on his body.\n\n\"Listen,\" said a German.\n\nFar down the hill he heard the deep-throated rumble of a big\nmotor.\n\n\"Armor,\" the German said.\n\nThe earth shook. The tank rounded the bend. Read watched the\nsquat, angular monster until its stubby gun pointed at the\nstation. It stopped less than two hundred yards away.\n\nA loud-speaker blared.\n\nATTENTION UN SOLDIERS.\nATTENTION UN SOLDIERS.\nYOU MAY THINK US SAVAGES\nBUT WE HAVE MODERN WEAPONS.\nWE HAVE ATOMIC WARHEADS,\nALL GASES, ROCKETS\nAND FLAME THROWERS. IF\nYOU DO NOT SURRENDER\nOUR PREMIER, WE WILL DESTROY YOU.\n\n\"They know we don't have any big weapons,\" Read said. \"They know\nwe have only gas grenades and small arms.\"\n\nHe looked nervously from side to side. They couldn't bring the\ncopter in with that thing squatting out there.\n\nA few feet away, sprawled behind a barricade of tables, lay a man\nin advanced shock. His deadly white skin shone like ivory. They\nwouldn't even look like that. One nuclear shell from that gun and\nthey'd be vaporized. Or perhaps the tank had sonic projectors;\nthen the skin would peel off their bones. Or they might be\nburned, or cut up by shrapnel, or gassed with some new mist their\nmasks couldn't filter.\n\nRead shut his eyes. All around him he heard heavy breathing,\nmumbled comments, curses. Clothes rustled as men moved restlessly.\n\nBut already the voice of Sergeant Rashid resounded in the murky\nroom.\n\n\"We've got to knock that thing out before the copter comes.\nOtherwise, he can't land. I have six Molotov cocktails here. Who\nwants to go hunting with me?\"\n\nFor two years Read had served under Sergeant Rashid. To him, the\nsergeant was everything a UN inspector should be. Rashid's\ndevotion to peace had no limits.\n\nRead's psych tests said pride alone drove him on. That was good\nenough for the UN; they only rejected men whose loyalties might\nconflict with their duties. But an assault on the tank required\nsomething more than a hunger for self-respect.\n\nRead had seen the inspector who covered their getaway. He had\nwatched their escort charge three-to-one odds. He had seen\nanother inspector stay behind at Miaka Station. And here, in this\nbuilding, lay battered men and dead men.\n\nAll UN inspectors. All part of his life.\n\nAnd he was part of their life. Their blood, their sacrifice, and\npain, had become a part of him.\n\n\"I'll take a cocktail, Sarge.\"\n\n\"Is that Read?\"\n\n\"Who else did you expect?\"\n\n\"Nobody. Anybody else?\"\n\n\"I'll go,\" the Frenchman said. \"Three should be enough. Give us a\ngood smoke screen.\"\n\n\n\nRashid snapped orders. He put the German inspector in charge of\nUmluana. Read, the Frenchman and himself, he stationed at\nthirty-foot intervals along the floor.\n\n\"Remember,\" Rashid said. \"We have to knock out that gun.\"\n\nRead had given away his machine gun. He held a gas-filled bottle\nin each hand. His automatic nestled in its shoulder holster.\n\nRashid whistled.\n\nDozens of smoke grenades tumbled through the air. Thick mist\nengulfed the tank. Read stood up and ran forward. He crouched but\ndidn't zigzag. Speed counted most here.\n\nGunfire shook the hill. The Belderkans couldn't see them but they\nknew what was going on and they fired systematically into the\nsmoke.\n\nBullets ploughed the ground beside him. He raised his head and\nfound the dim silhouette of the tank. He tried not to think about\nbullets ploughing through his flesh.\n\nA bullet slammed into his hip. He fell on his back, screaming.\n\"Sarge. _Sarge._\"\n\n\"I'm hit, too,\" Rashid said. \"Don't stop if you can move.\"\n\n_Listen to him. What's he got, a sprained ankle?_\n\nBut he didn't feel any pain. He closed his eyes and threw himself\nonto his stomach. And nearly fainted from pain. He screamed and\nquivered. The pain stopped. He stretched out his hands, gripping\nthe wine bottles, and inched forward. Pain stabbed him from\nstomach to knee.\n\n\"I can't move, Sarge.\"\n\n\"Read, you've got to. I think you're the only--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nGuns clattered. Bullets cracked.\n\n\"Sergeant Rashid! Answer me.\"\n\nHe heard nothing but the lonely passage of the bullets in the\nmist.\n\n\"I'm a UN man,\" he mumbled. \"You people up there know what a UN\nman is? You know what happens when you meet one?\"\n\nWhen he reached the tank, he had another bullet in his right arm.\nBut they didn't know he was coming and when you get within ten\nfeet of a tank, the men inside can't see you.\n\nHe just had to stand up and drop the bottle down the gun barrel.\nThat was all--with a broken hip and a wounded right arm.\n\nHe knew they would see him when he stood up but he didn't think\nabout that. He didn't think about Sergeant Rashid, about the\ncomplicated politics of Africa, about crowded market streets. He\nhad to kill the tank. That was all he thought about. He had\ndecided something in the world was more important than himself,\nbut he didn't know it or realize the psychologists would be\nsurprised to see him do this. He had made many decisions in the\nlast few minutes. He had ceased to think about them or anything\nelse.\n\nWith his cigarette lighter, he lit the rag stuffed in the end of\nthe bottle.\n\nBiting his tongue, he pulled himself up the front of the tank.\nHis long arm stretched for the muzzle of the gun. He tossed the\nbottle down the dark throat.\n\nAs he fell, the machine-gun bullets hit him in the chest, then in\nthe neck. He didn't feel them. He had fainted the moment he felt\nthe bottle leave his hand.\n\nThe copter landed ten minutes later. Umluana left in a shower of\nbullets. A Russian private, the ranking man alive in the station,\nsurrendered the survivors to the Belderkans.\n\n\n\nHis mother hung the Global Medal above the television set.\n\n\"He must have been brave,\" she said. \"We had a fine son.\"\n\n\"He was our only son,\" her husband said. \"What did he volunteer\nfor? Couldn't somebody else have done it?\"\n\nHis wife started to cry. Awkwardly, he embraced her. He wondered\nwhat his son had wanted that he couldn't get at home.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n",
