Mother misunderstood me; father follered suit, and\nnow you\u2014Siggie, my old pal\u2014you turns on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMisunderstood!\u201d Sig turned in his saddle and gazed reflectively at\nhis partner. \u201cRen Merton, if you was ever entered fer th\u2019 human race\nyou shore was scratched. Yore nose ain\u2019t right\u2014too long. Yuh got uh\nbad case uh squints in both uh yore eyes, and yore mouth, which was\ncut too wide in th\u2019 first place, ain\u2019t shrunk none a-tall.\nShoulders? Say, I sometimes wonder how comes it that yore collar\ndon\u2019t slip down and trip yuh. Also, yore right foot is where yore\nleft ought to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cPickled prairie-dogs, that\u2019s right!\u201d agreed Ren. \u201cI reckon I shore\nmust a been muddled this mawnin\u2019 when I puts on m\u2019 boots.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd also yore hair\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stops at hair!\u201d exploded Ren. \u201cMebby I\u2019ve got red hair and\nmebby she runs uh little to th\u2019 rusty shade, but I\u2019ll be danged if\nany feller with fat eyebrows, buffalo-horn mustache and bow legs can\ntaunt me with th\u2019 fact. Take uh look in th\u2019 glass and you\u2019ll see\nthat you ain\u2019t no one-to-ten shot in this race yoreself, Sig.\u201d\n\nSig grunted and turned back. The horses seemed to start by mutual\nconsent and plodded off down the hogback.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve knowed uh lot uh people,\u201d remarked Sig, \u201cwho thought they had\nred hair, but\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nHe pulled up his horse.\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t that a voice, Ren?\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon not\u2014not uh human one anyway. Go on and finish yore\nremarks about hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell yuh I heard somebody yell!\u201d declared Sig. \u201cIt was jist over\nthat ridge, and I\u2019m goin\u2019 to see who it was.\u201d\n\nHe spurred his horse into a gallop and Ren followed at his heels.\nThey crossed the ridge and swung down into an open timbered swale,\ninterspersed with clumps of willows and jack-pines.\n\nThere they saw her. She was tied to a tree and seemed to be exerting\nevery muscle to get loose. She was dressed in a faded calico dress\nand her dark-brown hair tumbled in confusion about her half-bare\nshoulders.\n\nThe sight of her was a shock to the punchers and they threw their\nbroncos back on their haunches at the sight. The girl didn\u2019t see\nthem, and after the first gasp of surprise they sat there and stared\nat her.\n\nSuddenly she shrank back against the tree and screamed\u2014\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Oscar!\u201d\n\nLike a flash of yellow light a scared cougar had bounded out of the\nwillow thicket near her and crouched low.\n\nRen acted first. While he hadn\u2019t the uncanny skill on the draw\nattributed to the Western gunman, he was deadly when he did \u201cget his\nol\u2019 smoke-wagon unhitched.\u201d The cougar had barely touched his belly\nto the ground when Ren\u2019s .45 started to spout death and destruction.\n\nTwo of the heavy slugs tore through its neck, and the cougar tied\nitself in a snarling, spitting knot and rolled over dead. When the\nlast shot was fired Ren\u2019s horse was nearly over the body of the\ncougar and Ren was shoving fresh shells into the gun.\n\nThe girl looked at Ren in a dazed sort of a way for a moment and\nthen in a tired little voice remarked\u2014\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t Oscar.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d agreed Ren foolishly. \u201cThat shore wasn\u2019t Oscar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked a deep bass voice, and Ren turned in his\nsaddle; behind him stood a florid-faced person in a green corduroy\nsuit and panama, and behind him a narrow-shouldered, sharp-faced man\nin knickerbockers.\n\n\u201cWhat happened, I asked?\u201d repeated the florid one.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Oscar,\u201d stated the girl for the third time.\n\n\u201cWell, what was it, then?\u201d queried the sharp-faced man.\n\n\u201cI kept grinding until this cowboy person butted in and spoiled it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you quit then?\u201d roared the florid one. \u201cBy Jupiter! You lost a\nfine chance for some real stuff. But what happened to Oscar, and\nwhere in the world did this other lion come from?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it\u2014I say\u2014where did it?\u201d\n\nAnother person had joined the crowd. He was hatless and garbed in\nthe costume of the early settler, fringed and beaded buckskin from\nhis toes to his chin, and his face was ashen. He walked up with an\nuncertain gait and his breathing gave evidence of recent exertion.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to you, Jack?\u201d asked the florid one.\n\n\u201cWhy, I\u2014uh\u2014I\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou met it too, did you?\u201d grinned the thin-faced one, and the\nfringed one gulped an assent.\n\n\u201cI was\u2014er\u2014just coming through that clump of bushes and I met it.\nYou see I\u2014er\u2014thought perhaps that if I ran I could coax it away\nfrom the rest of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw, haw, haw!\u201d roared Sig. \u201cYou shore ought to git uh hero medal.\nDidn\u2019t yuh know that no self-respectin\u2019 cougar would chase uh git-up\nlike that?\u201d\n\nJust then two more men came running down the hill and, seeing the\ncrowd, one of them stopped and cupped his hands.\n\n\u201cMister Norton!\u201d he yelled. \u201cOscar slipped his collar and got away!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust my luck!\u201d exclaimed Norton, the florid one. \u201cHere I bring this\nbunch way up here to finish that film, and that blamed cat gets away\nand spoils it all!\u201d\n\n\u201cOscar is uh cougar, I takes it,\u201d opined Ren, rolling a cigarette\nand looking admiringly at the girl. \u201cI reckon somebody might as well\nlet th\u2019 lady loose. Cougars bein\u2019 thick, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to\ntie ladies to trees anyway.\u201d\n\nOne of the men cut the ropes which bound her, and the thin-faced man\nrecovered his camera from the willow thicket.\n\n\u201cMiss, I reckon you can have that cougar skin if yuh wants it,\u201d\nremarked Sig. \u201cWe ain\u2019t got no use fer it, and if yuh wants it I\u2019ll\nhave Ren skin it fer yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Miss Reynolds,\u201d she replied with a smile. \u201cAnd I\u2019d love to\nshake hands with both of you. You gentlemen saved my life, and I\nhaven\u2019t words to thank you with.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, Miss Reynolds,\u201d replied Sig. \u201cLittle thing like\nthat\u2014why\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSlack up yore rope!\u201d rasped Ren. \u201cYou never saved anything\u2014not\neven yore salary, and now yuh tells her that it\u2019s uh little thing to\nsave her life.\u201d He leaned over an\u2019 held out his hand. \u201cMiss\nReynolds, I\u2019m uh heap glad to meet yuh. My name\u2019s Ren Merton, and if\nthere\u2019s anything I can do fer yuh\u2014yuh can have that catskin to\nremember me by.\u201d\n\nShe gave him a sweet smile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to have it, Mr. Merton. I\u2019ll have one of the men skin it,\nand every time I put my foot on that rug I\u2019ll remember you. I\u2019ve had\nmy life saved many times on the films, but this being the first time\nin real life, I just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI jist hope yuh won\u2019t forget it, anyway,\u201d laughed Ren.\n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll forget it?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cLady,\u201d interrupted Sig, \u201cthat hombre can forget anything. I\u2019m th\u2019\nbrains of our outfit, and if yuh wants an intelligent favor done,\njist ask me. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether you gentlemen are in earnest or not. Do you\nmean everything you say to each other?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d replied Sig, with a bow, \u201cbut Mr. Merton here never meant\nanything he ever said. He\u2019s notorious fer jist talkin\u2019. As I orates\nbefore, Miss Reynolds, if there is anything I can do fer yuh,\nwhy\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI do wish we could get Oscar,\u201d she replied reflectively. \u201cThere\ngoes poor old Nortie up the hill with a broken heart, and I know\nthat Jack Markham is awfully put out about it too. You see we\u2019ve\nsimply got to have a cougar or we can\u2019t finish the picture. I wonder\nif you could catch Oscar? He\u2019s as tame as a kitten and has never\nbeen wild. The company raised him\u2014got him from a zoo when he was a\nlittle yellow kitten. I know that Mr. Norton would be willing to pay\nyou well if you would catch him.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Reynolds, we ain\u2019t mercenary thataway,\u201d replied Sig. \u201cI ain\u2019t\nwastin\u2019 no love on that Norton person, and I don\u2019t rassel no cougar\nfer his money, but if you really wants that cat, I\u2019m promisin\u2019 it to\nyuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s awfully kind of you,\u201d she cooed. \u201cIf you could catch him and\nbring him back here tomorrow, I could just love you both. Then we\ncould finish that picture. Really, he is as tame as a kitten.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider him caught,\u201d boasted Sig. \u201cMe and Ren will bring him to\nyore house tomorrow mawnin\u2019. Uh course I could git him alone, but\nbein\u2019 as Ren is with me I\u2019ll let him help.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanin\u2019,\u201d drawled Ren, \u201cthat I ropes that cat and ties him up fer\nshipment, and Sig writes th\u2019 address.\u201d\n\nMiss Reynolds insisted on shaking hands with both of them again, and\nher smile left them both unable to roll a cigarette.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in those cabins up there in the pines,\u201d she explained,\n\u201cand probably will be there for a few days. You can bring him right\nup there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d they both replied, and watched her skip up the hill in the\nwake of the rest of the party.\n\nAbout half-way to the top she stopped and threw them a kiss, and\nthen danced out of sight in the jack-pines.\n\nRen rolled a fresh smoke and studied Sig\u2019s rapt expression from\nunder his hat brim. Suddenly he broke into song\u2014\u2014\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what made th\u2019 wildcat wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanin\u2019 which?\u201d demanded Sig.\n\n\u201cOscar,\u201d chuckled Ren. \u201cDon\u2019t yuh see, Sig? Them velvet optics made\nOscar\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d snapped Sig. \u201cConfine yore humor to somethin\u2019 else. I\ndon\u2019t sit here inactive and hear yuh slander them eyes none\nwhatever. _Sabe_? I\u2019m backin\u2019 th\u2019 lady\u2019s play\u2014me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe and you both,\u201d replied Ren seriously. \u201cBut did yuh ever stop to\nconsider that you gits so danged conceited when uh female person\nspeaks to yuh that yuh promises to do anything? Cougars ain\u2019t\nwoodchucks nor snowshoe rabbits, and I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 aloud that you\u2019ve\ngone plumb out of yore class this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll git him,\u201d snapped Sig. \u201cOne of th\u2019 fellers told me that th\u2019\nlast they saw of him he was lopin\u2019 up th\u2019 trail, and that means he\u2019s\nliable to hive up in our cabin. Bein\u2019 as he\u2019s uh house-bred animule,\nit stands to reason that he\u2019s goin\u2019 to hunt human company soon\u2019s he\ngits hungry or gits scared of th\u2019 dark. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\nRen nodded and they turned their horses and rode on up the trail to\ntheir cabin about two miles away. They unsaddled their horses at the\ncorral and then laid down on their bunks for a much-needed rest.\n\nIt was almost dark when Ren awoke and looked around the cabin. Sig\nwas gone. Ren got up and was lazily pulling on his boots when Sig\ncame in with a hammer in his hand and a smile on his face.\n\n\u201cTh\u2019 sleek hare sleeps while th\u2019 sly fox schemes,\u201d he quoted\ndramatically. \u201cI reckon I\u2019ve laid uh trap fer Oscar.\u201d\n\nHe hung up the hammer and went out again. A few moments later he was\nback of the cabin fumbling with the one window. \u201cHelp me take this\nthing out, Ren!\u201d he yelled.\n\nRen removed the nails from the inside and Sig removed the window and\nthrew in the end of his lariat rope.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s th\u2019 idea?\u201d asked Ren.\n\nSig grinned and coiled up the rope.\n\n\u201cCougar trap. I got this rope fixed so\u2019s that when th\u2019 cougar gits\ninside of th\u2019 shed, all we got to do is to pull on th\u2019 rope and th\u2019\ndoor shuts. There\u2019s uh quarter uh venison in th\u2019 shed and I\u2019m\nbettin\u2019 that Oscar falls fer it, Ren. What do yuh think about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSig, yore uh wonder! I\u2019m bettin\u2019 that you\u2019ve already deduced how to\ntie him up after we gits him inside. I shore honors and respects\nyuh, old timer, and as uh special mark of respect I allows yuh to\nprepare our evenin\u2019 meal. I\u2019m so hungry I could eat Oscar, I\nreckon.\u201d\n\nThree hours later they sat humped up on their bunk and watched the\ndoor of the shed, a splotch of black in the half moonlight, and\nprayed that the cougar would come before they lost too much sleep.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t light that cigarette here,\u201d cautioned Ren. \u201cGo back near th\u2019\ndoor. If that cat saw th\u2019 light he\u2019d never show up.\u201d\n\nSig tiptoed to the front of the cabin and sat down on a box. Ren sat\nby the window for a few minutes and then joined Sig.\n\n\u201cGive me yore papers and I\u2019ll roll one, too. I reckon it\u2019s uh little\ntoo early fer Oscar to show up yet.\u201d\n\nThey smoked in silence for a while and then sneaked back to the\nwindow. Sig took one long look at the door and then threw himself\nbackward and heaved on the rope. The door shut with a bang and an\nunearthly yelp split the stillness of the night.\n\n\u201cGot him!\u201d whooped Sig. \u201cI seen his eyes and slammed that old door\nright in his face! Whoopee!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood work!\u201d exclaimed Ren. \u201cI\u2019ll bet Oscar is plumb scared to death\nright now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot any he ain\u2019t. Oscar\u2019s uh tame cougar and, while he may display\nuh little peevishness at first, he\u2019ll be plumb satisfied with that\nhunk uh meat. Let\u2019s go out and see what he\u2019s doin\u2019.\u201d\n\nThey walked around the shed but were unable to size up their catch,\nas the shed had no windows. They could hear a sniffling at the\ncracks of the door and suddenly a heavy body was flung against it,\nbut the heavy bar on the outside held it fast.\n\n\u201cWant to go inside and look him over?\u201d queried Ren.\n\n\u201cNot in his present state uh mind, I don\u2019t. That cat is shore some\nirritated and when they gits fussed thataway they\u2019re plumb informal.\nHow do yuh reckon we\u2019re goin\u2019 to acquire his carcass fer shipment?\u201d\n\n\u201cMight git some uh that movie outfit to come up and git him,\u201d\nsuggested Ren, but Sig promptly vetoed it.\n\n\u201cAnd have that beautiful lady think that me and you were afraid of\nher pet, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be uh live coward than uh dead hero,\u201d stated Ren. \u201cThere\nain\u2019t no honor in th\u2019 grave fer me. I got an idea though. Mebby\nshe\u2019s good and mebby again she ain\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll unfasten th\u2019 door and let her open jist a little ways. _Sabe?_\nTh\u2019 cat will try to come out and I\u2019ll slam th\u2019 door shut when he\u2019s\nhalf-ways out an\u2019 all you has to do is to put two ropes on him. You\ntake one and I\u2019ll take th\u2019 other and Mr. Oscar is plumb helpless.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh ha,\u201d agreed Sig. \u201cThat\u2019s uh _hy-iu_ scheme\u2014if you holds him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw \u2014\u2014, Sig, he\u2019s tame! I\u2019ll hold him. All you got to do is to\nslip th\u2019 two ropes on him and give me one. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\nSig went to the corral and brought back two ropes. He held the\nnooses handy while Ren removed the bar. He opened the door an inch\nat a time and braced himself for the rush.\n\n\u201cCome on out, Oscar,\u201d pleaded Sig. \u201cBe uh nice li\u2019l cat and come\non\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nOscar came, not sneakingly nor slowly but a rasping, spitting,\nclawing chunk of deviltry, and Ren shut the door just in time. It\ncaught Oscar at the flank and for a few seconds the air was full of\ncougar cuss words.\n\nSig advanced cautiously and managed to get one rope over its head\nand pulled the noose tight. He handed that rope to Ren, who\nimmediately proceeded to forget that he was there to keep the door\ntight. He grabbed the rope with both hands, braced himself for the\nrush and unthinkingly stepped away from the door.\n\nThere was a heave and a flash and the cougar sailed over Sig\u2019s head\nand out to the end of that rope. Ren was partly braced for the shock\nbut didn\u2019t figure on the velocity of the animal, and when the shock\ncame he went straight up in the air and off across the clearing.\n\nLuckily he lit running and hung on to the rope, and he and the\ncougar went down the hill, over stumps and through the thickets like\na spitting, yelling, yellow comet with a human tail.\n\nThey had traveled thus for about two hundred yards when the cougar\nwent on one side of a tree and Ren on the other. They almost met on\nthe big swing. The cat flipped upside down over a log while Ren\nalmost completed the circle, only stopping when he threw his arms\naround a tree and hung on. He still held the rope and had presence\nof mind enough left to proceed to tie that cat up good and tight.\nThe cougar had choked itself nearly to death trying to come up under\nthe log and Ren had little trouble in tying its hind legs so it was\nhelpless.\n\nHe rolled a smoke and hobbled back to the cabin. He wondered in a\ndetached sort of way what had become of Sig and why he didn\u2019t help\nhim hold it, but as he walked around the cabin he heard Sig\u2019s voice\nimploring him to:\n\n\u201cHurry up, fer Gawd\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s th\u2019 matter?\u201d asked Ren.\n\n\u201cCome over here you danged fool!\u201d wailed Sig. \u201cCan\u2019t yuh see I can\u2019t\nhold this door much longer!\u201d\n\n\u201cHold th\u2014what\u2014why, I\u2019ll be danged! Where did yuh git it, Sig?\u201d\n\n\u201cGrab hold uh this door! How do I know where I got it? When you and\nOscar paraded off down th\u2019 hill I sees uh pair uh eyes shinin\u2019 in\nthere and I jist slams th\u2019 door in time to catch his neck. Gosh,\nain\u2019t he a sassy-lookin\u2019 animule, Ren? Where\u2019s Oscar?\u201d\n\n\u201cHog-tied to uh log,\u201d mumbled Ren. \u201cAt least I got uh cougar tied to\nth\u2019 log\u2014I didn\u2019t ask his name. I wonder how two of \u2019em got in at\noncet, and which is Oscar?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t Oscar,\u201d stated Sig with conviction. \u201cNo house variety of\ncougar would have uh face and uh disposition like this one, Ren.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang onto th\u2019 door, Sig, while I takes uh board off th\u2019 wall and\nattacks him from behind. You jist keep on squeezin\u2019 him and I\u2019ll tie\nhim up.\u201d\n\nRen got the hammer and removed a board. The cougar objected at the\ntop of its voice, but in a few minutes Ren had it trussed up and\ntied off to a rafter.\n\nThey went into the cabin, boiled a pot of coffee and had a smoke.\n\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t know which is Oscar, but I reckon Miss Reynolds can\npick him out,\u201d remarked Ren.\n\n\u201cSaid she\u2019d love me if I got him,\u201d grinned Sid, \u201cand I\u2019ve got him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYore hearin\u2019 is on uh par with yore brains,\u201d drawled Ren. \u201cShe said\n\u2018us,\u2019 and what\u2019s more, Siggie, you ain\u2019t got him\u2014I\u2019ve got him.\n_Sabe?_ I risked my whole danged life to git her that cougar. You\ncan put yore location notice on that one in th\u2019 shed, but not on\nOscar. He\u2019s mine, located, filed and patented.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that so!\u201d exploded Sig. \u201cI\u2019m here to orate that it was my scheme\nwhich caught it! All you did was to hang on to th\u2019 rope and, not\nbein\u2019 overly strong nor active, you permits that li\u2019l cat to haul\nyuh around, regardless. And now yuh opines that yuh owns Oscar. Not\nany yuh don\u2019t!\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if yuh did tear yore pants,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf yuh\ncan\u2019t take care of yoreself don\u2019t blame me. I\u2019ve shore treated yuh\nwhite, Ren Merton, and now yuh turns and bites th\u2019 hand which feeds\nyuh!\u201d\n\n\u201cBites yore hand!\u201d snorted Ren, shaking his forefinger under Sig\u2019s\nnose. \u201cListen: any time I starts bitin\u2019 you won\u2019t confine yore\ndiagnosis to hands, old timer. I orates openly that as soon as\ndaylight comes I\u2019m goin\u2019 down and make uh crate and prepare Oscar\nfer shipment. _Sabe?_ I ain\u2019t concernin\u2019 myself about that cat in\nth\u2019 shed and hereby waives all rights to him, but I duly informs all\npresent company that I\u2019m uh close corporation when it comes to li\u2019l\u2019\nOscar. Let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot with you!\u201d snarled Sig. \u201cI\u2019ll take uh blanket and go out in th\u2019\nwoods or sleep in th\u2019 shed with th\u2019 cougar. I hereby refuses to\nshare yore bed and I does it without malice in m\u2019 heart. You grieves\nme deeply, Mr. Merton, and I\u2019m sore at heart and meek-feelin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cHop to it!\u201d grunted Ren, as he rolled into the bunk and stretched\nwearily. \u201cDon\u2019t go near Oscar \u2019cause I reckon he\u2019s fond uh meek\nthings.\u201d\n\nSig took a blanket and went out, closing the door softly. As the\ndoor closed, Ren slid out of his bunk and peered out of the window.\nHe chuckled as he saw Sig wander off into the trees, and he sat up\nand rolled a smoke and seemed to ponder deeply. Suddenly he slapped\nhis leg and pinched out the light of his cigarette.\n\n\u201cBy golly!\u201d he chuckled, \u201cwon\u2019t Sig go high, wide and handsome?\u201d\n\nThe first tinge of morning showed in the east when Ren slipped out\nof the cabin and approached the shed. Ten minutes later a tawny\nfigure glided out of the open shed and bounded off into the\nunderbrush. Five minutes later an apparition in rags stumbled out of\nthe shed and leaned uncertainly against the wall.\n\n\u201cMama mine!\u201d it mumbled. \u201cI must be uh sight. Them danged things\nwon\u2019t go away when yuh gives \u2019em uh chance. I shore am scratched\nsome artistic.\u201d\n\nHe staggered into the cabin and painfully removed his torn clothing.\nHe tore up some of the shirt for bandages, but there was too much\nspace to cover and he was awfully tired. He sat on the bunk as naked\nas the day he was born and fumbled for a cigarette in the pockets he\ndidn\u2019t have on.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be teetotally \u2014\u2014!\u201d exclaimed Sig\u2019s voice from the\ndoorway but Ren never looked up. \u201cCome on and help me, Sig. I reckon\nI\u2019m all cut to shoestrings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t alone, Ren.\u201d\n\nRen lifted his head and looked at Sig.\n\n\u201cPickled prairie-dogs!\u201d he groaned. \u201cWhat happened to you? Did\nyou\u2014huh\u2014turn Oscar loose?\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter seven years uh hard fightin\u2019 and hardships I manages to break\nhis holt,\u201d declared Sig dismally. \u201cI\u2019m jist uh walkin\u2019 hunk uh\nHamburger steak, Ren, and I feels that when I removes my clothes\nI\u2019ll be no more. That cat jist simply prospected every piece uh meat\non my frame. In my war-sack under th\u2019 bunk there\u2019s uh roll uh\nstickin\u2019 plaster. You wrap me up and I\u2019ll do th\u2019 same fer you, Ren.\nI\u2019ve done played my last joke\u2014absolutely. I suppose th\u2019 shed is\nempty?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh ha,\u201d nodded Ren. \u201cI\u2019m apologizin\u2019, Sig.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, Ren, I reckon misery likes company.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d drawled Ren, \u201cshe\u2019s got it.\u201d\n\nHalf an hour later, with adhesive plaster covering most of their\nbodies they laid down on the bunk and rolled more cigarettes.\n\n\u201cI wonder which one was Oscar?\u201d mused Sig aloud, but Ren was deep in\nthought and made no answer.\n\nFinally Ren drew a deep breath and turned to Sig.\n\n\u201cThem movie people take big chances, don\u2019t they? Jist think about uh\ngirl playin\u2019 with Oscar. Tame? Say, I shore hope I never meets uh\nwild cougar, Sig. That animule shore put his trade-mark on me.\u201d\n\nJust then there came a clatter of horse\u2019s hoofs outside and Sig\nlimped over to the closed door.\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d yelled a voice, which they both recognized as that of\nNorton, the movie director.\n\n\u201cHello, yoreself!\u201d retorted Sig. \u201cWe\u2019re takin\u2019 our mornin\u2019 bath and\ncan\u2019t come out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d laughed Norton. \u201cI just came up here to deliver\na message to you from Miss Reynolds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d asked Sig quickly.\n\n\u201cShe said for you boys not to worry about Oscar because he came back\nright after you left.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be sore about something,\u201d reflected Norton as his horse picked\nits way down the narrow trail. \u201cEither they are sore or mighty\nungentlemanly, because they never even said \u2018thank you.\u2019\u201d\n\n                                 THE END\n[Transcriber\u2019s Note: This story appeared in the July, 1916 issue of\nAdventure magazine.]\n",
