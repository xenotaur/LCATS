No one could learn to swim by reading a book.\nFive-eighths of a mile the first time in the water!\"\n\nAnd they laughed. I guess I laughed, too. More than any other thing,\nI've wanted people to be happy. But I never swam again--only that first\ntime.\n\nI've always read a lot and sometimes things I've read do get mixed up\nwith things I've done. But the things still happened--they happened to\n_someone_. And people ought to _believe_.\n\nI'd like to tell people now. I'd like to say, \"I died once.\"\n\nBut if they laughed, it might be later and I'd never hear them. Already\nthere are too many silent things in this. There must be no silent\nlaughter as well.\n\nThey might think I've got myself all mixed up with things I've read.\nThings like surgeons pumping life into a heart to bring the patient\nback after he's died on the operating table. Doctors reviving dead\nsoldiers, if they haven't been gone too long.\n\nIt's not like that at all. I was truly dead--for three days. It was\nalmost too long; I suppose I made it back just in time. I don't know.\n\nMy reading was what started me on this, just the same as with the\nswimming. When I think about it too much, I almost feel myself that I\nam exaggerating a bit.\n\nBut I have proof, proof which no one has ever seen but the doctors and\nthose who found me. See how they keep me swathed in these cloths and\nhow the darkened room hides my eyes?\n\nAnyway, I'd be ashamed to show myself, for the mark of death is too\nterrible and people would be even more afraid of dying than they are\nnow.\n\n\n\nYou see, I could have done it in the winter, only I was worried about\nthe cold. I might not have been able to get back at all. But it was too\nwarm when I chose to do it. I should have known better. I've read a\nlot about keeping things. You can't preserve them in the hot weather;\nthat's why the doctors put those dead soldiers in ice chests, but I\ndidn't think about it enough. I made some other mistakes, too, but I\ncouldn't have known.\n\nI guess what started it all was something I read a long time ago,\nperhaps in a story, or an agricultural bulletin, or maybe in an\nencyclopedia. Anyhow, it was something about pigs being able to just\ndie if they want to.\n\nThat always stuck in my mind. It's a pretty wonderful thing, you know.\nImagine just being able to die if life didn't seem worth living, or if\nyou were lonely, or maybe just because you wanted to.\n\nOh, I told lots of people about it. You know how sometimes a lull comes\nin a conversation. Then I'd say, \"Pigs are able to just up and die if\nthey want to.\"\n\nBut nobody ever paid any attention to me at all. They seemed to ignore\nthe remark. One man did say once, \"What the hell are you talking\nabout?\" but even he wouldn't listen when I tried to explain.\n\nPerhaps it was just too improbable. Besides, people don't like to think\nabout death. They talk about it sometimes and sometimes they brood\nabout it, but they never really think. It has always been too unknown\nand that frightens them. Then they only fear and stop thinking.\n\nIt always did seem sad to me that no one had ever tried to help people\nout about death. Yes, I know one did. He died and came back--but then\nHe wasn't just a man like you or me. And even He never said exactly\nwhat it was like.\n\nI wondered if anyone really ever _had_ said. So I began to read with\nonly a single purpose in mind. I had to know so I could tell people. If\nthey could only know, then they wouldn't have that fear and we could\ntalk of death and still be able to laugh.\n\nBut I had read it all when I read of Jacob's dream, for that's all\nthere was--dreams, visions, hopes. No one had ever seen and come back\nto tell the others.\n\nThe question then was _why_, not _what_. It couldn't be that all who\ndied had no whole being to return to. Not every death is marked by a\nbody completely uninhabitable. I myself had heard a doctor say, \"There\nis nothing organically wrong now. The patient will recover if only he\nhas the will to live.\"\n\n_The will to live!_ Suddenly I knew I had found the way. I myself would\ngo and see and return to tell them all.\n\n\n\nI answered all the requirements. I had a healthy body to return to. I\nhad the will to live, for I enjoy my reading and acquaintances. And I\nalone had thought it wonderful that pigs can die when they merely want\nto.\n\nI knew that I could, too, and I was not afraid. Very carefully, I began\nwhat seemed almost too simple preparations.\n\nDrawing some money from an account I kept for medical expenses (at the\ntime I thought this very amusing), I bought an electric clock which\nregistered the hour and the day of the month on cylinders like those on\na tachometer. I felt I would want to know exactly how long I had been\ndeceased when I came back.\n\nNext I secured a small round mirror with a concave face, the type\nsome use for shaving. This I was to hang directly above my face. It\nwas merely vanity on my part, for I wished to say that I as well as\nLazarus's friends had seen a dead man rise. I had assumed that at first\nmy vision might be blurred and thus the magnifying effect of this\nparticular glass would, I thought, help me focus on my face.\n\nOn my study floor, I prepared a pallet. It was neither soft nor hard,\njust a comfortable support for the body I was to leave. Beside it I\narranged a basin of water and some soft cloths, for I would want to\nwash right after coming back.\n\nYou see, I did not fear the obvious. My power lay in thought and I\nproceeded systematically.\n\nDrawn blinds and two small night-lights spread a gray cast over the\nroom, a cast that I was to know too well.\n\nEverything was ready now. No, wait! Quickly I placed a tumbler and a\ndecanter of brandy within easy reach and by them laid a pencil and\na pad of paper. It was when I straightened up that I first felt the\npounding in my body. My heart pulsed as if it were smashing waves of\nblood through my veins. In my throat, the large arteries swelled with\npressure until I thought I would strangle.\n\nI had to have some physical exertion to relieve the tension. I felt\nI might faint or have a stroke unless I moved about. My father had\nbeen stricken with an embolism at about my age, and I've read such\nweaknesses are inherited.\n\nSo I walked about the house rechecking the locks of windows and\ndoors. Perhaps it was just to keep busy for a few more moments that\nI even rechecked the pads of cardboard with which I had muffled the\nbell-clappers on both telephone and door chime. I don't seem to have\nhad many callers for several years now, but I had to avoid any chance\nof being disturbed.\n\n\n\nSomewhat calmed by my exertion, I prepared to lie down, but a\nsentimental whim moved me like an automaton toward the window. It was\nthe only really unreasoning thing I did.\n\nLike a prisoner denied the light on penalty of torture, I knelt down\nand looked under the blind. Never was the Sun so dazzling. This\nslightest lifting of the shade poured onto me a warmth that I had never\nknown before.\n\nAn old saying, invading my mind, destroyed the illusion, and laughing a\nbit nervously at \"seeking his place in the Sun,\" I turned away and lay\ndown.\n\nThe dials on my new calendar clock registered 3:15, July 12. Reaching\nfor my pad and pencil, I recorded this and then, refolding my hands\nacross my chest, I lay quite still.\n\nThe heat of the day had begun to saturate the closed room. Outside, all\nwas quiet, as if the Sun had mesmerized the world. The insect hum of\nthe electric clock was the only clue of life around me.\n\nLooming large above me in the mirror, the magnified reflection of my\nface calmed my mind with its placidity. Great-lidded Buddha eyes gazed\ndown, holding in their glow my first understanding of Nirvana.\n\nI knew that it had come. I had reached the boundary where the fear of\nreturnless going stopped the psyche just this side.\n\nMy only body consciousness was the heavy _thud_ ... _thud_ ... _thud_\nof blood being driven through my veins. I toyed with stopping the\nthudding, feeling and savoring the pause between those sledge-hammer\nstrokes on my brain--knowing that any one of those pauses lengthened to\neternity was death.\n\nSuddenly I shrieked and sat upright. For an instant, my body had\ncompletely stopped and I had known it. Only a nameless grasping fear\nhad snatched me back.\n\nMy heart beat wildly as I gasped for air. With shaking hands, I poured\na drink and gulped it down. It had been close.\n\nStill trembling, I arose and slumped into a chair. I had to organize\nmyself, to think my way along this thing.\n\nWhat had happened to me?\n\nThis one thing I knew: I _could_ do it. I could stop my body at will\nand I had done it, if only for a second.\n\nThis thought reassured me or perhaps the brandy opened my reserve of\ncourage, for I had been sitting in the chair some time.\n\n\n\nWith caution, I approached the pallet. I regarded it with suspicion, as\nthough there were a deadly scorpion in its folds. Then, jeering at my\nhesitation, I lay down and composed myself as before. The clock said\n5:05. I stirred again only to record this on the pad.\n\nDespite my nervousness, things proceeded faster this time. A morbid\nexcitement carried me along the path I now already knew. And at its\nend, I flirted with the _stopping_. Going over and stepping back, going\nover and stepping back.\n\nIt was a pleasure exquisite and unique. Once felt, it was unresistable.\n\nI was no longer afraid. I did not have to be. I could stop my body and\nstart it at will. So I let it slip away from me. The thuddings ceased\nand only the pauses remained--silent, shapeless things in endless\nprocession. And then the great silence. It flowed over me and I was\nlost.\n\nThe silence was too heavy and my thoughts were not my own; they floated\nup away from me in the silence. I could feel them go, but there was\nnothing to bring them back. Each thought of protest winged its way\ninto a void with all the rest.\n\nAnd nothing else remained but the will to live. As the silence lapped\naround this will, it grew until it alone was I. The silence washed\nabout it, but it stood.\n\nThen the little rippings and the slicings and the tearings and the\nsoftening of things were there--heard without sound, felt without\nfeeling, like the pulling of a tooth from a novocaine-deadened jaw.\n\nIt was then I saw the face.\n\nHave you ever felt the terror of suddenly waking with a face--a face\nof eyes--staring into your unguarded and bewildered first glance? One\nfeels as if this face would look into one's very life and wrest it from\nhim. Perhaps it is a nascent fear of one's own mask of death.\n\nBut I could not escape the mask. It loomed above me with gaping maw\nand staring eyes; eyes that seemed more dead and deadly as my vision\ncleared. The mirror enlarged the horror that lay below it.\n\nIt was the wrench of nausea that pulled me from this nightmare. In the\nviolence of the retching, I rolled from beneath the mirror and raised\nmyself to hands and knees. I had knocked over the clock and it shouted\nup at me--10:05, July 15. Three days! Too long! Too horribly long!\n\n\n\nSlowly I dragged myself to the telephone and pulled it from the stand.\nI remember nothing else until they brought me here.\n\nIt's been eight days--eight days away from death, yet I'm closer to\nit now than ever before. And I can't _think_ of it. The fear has come\ncrashing through and I can't _think_.\n\nThis thing, this body is too far gone. I won't be able to make it move.\nI'll just feel it getting away--little by little--ripping apart cell by\ncell, and then everywhere all at once.\n\nI can feel it now. But in that great silence, I could almost hear the\ntearing--yet there was no sound.\n\nThe doctors have given up all hope. I can see it in their faces. I\ncould hear them talking among themselves when they brought me in. They\nhad to give it a name. There's a certain safety in a name, you know.\n\nI would have told them, but I was afraid they'd laugh. The nurses would\nlaugh and say to each other, \"Have you heard what the one in 408 wanted\nin his case history?\"\n\nI couldn't stand the laughter now.\n\nBut that's the way my chart should read--Cause of Death:--_Death!_\n\n\n\n\n",
