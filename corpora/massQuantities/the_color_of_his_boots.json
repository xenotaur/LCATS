It\u2019s all right for\na feller to desire to appear to a good advantage, especially on Sunday,\nbut a finicky person hadn\u2019t ought to pack a gun at a time when he\u2019s just\nacquired something out of the ordinary in haberdashery.\n\nNew boots don\u2019t mean nothing but misery to me. They could set diamonds\nall the way around the sole, but just the same she don\u2019t spell nothing\nbut blisters and cramps to Ike Harper. Anyway, I\u2019m so bow-legged that my\nheels have got to be run over on the outside edges before I can be\ncomfortable around the knees.\n\nMagpie paid twenty dollars for them yaller boots. They was glowing with\nyouth, vitality and shiny polish when Magpie leaned \u2019em against the side\nof that Pullman berth. They was a thing of beauty and a joy forever.\n\nA pair of boots ain\u2019t nothing but footwear, except when they\u2019re the\ncolor of a sunset in Injun Summer and fit like the skin on a\nsausage--and cost twenty dollars.\n\nSome folks will likely argue that Magpie hadn\u2019t owned said boots long\nenough to become attached to \u2019em, but to those critics I will say: you\ndon\u2019t have to have a twenty-dollar bill around the house very long\nbefore you becomes sentimental about it.\n\nMe and Magpie are on our way back from the Stampede at Totem, where we\nwent to clean up some money, figuring that we knowed a little more than\nthe fellers did who run the games. We found out that honesty is a poor\npoker policy in Totem.\n\nMagpie sheds bitter tears over them boots. Their pristine yaller has\nwent. A porter, suffering from color-blindness, lack of illumination, or\ngin, has rubbed \u2019em plentiful with black polish until there ain\u2019t\nnothing identifying left except the shape and size.\n\nMagpie also bought a new blanket from an Injun robe vender. It contains\nall the colors of the rainbow, and the design is supposed to invoke a\nspecial blessing from some high-cheeked god of some kind.\n\nMagpie looks at said boots, folds \u2019em reverently in the blanket and then\npushes the bell in the berth. Them boots has been under that seat ever\nsince we got up in the morning. Magpie, being a heap vain, desires to\npack \u2019em openly and places same in the aisle at night, along with his\nregular ones. Now that he wishes to show off a little, he opines to put\n\u2019em on. He sets there in his socks and pushes that little button.\n\nAs I said before, Magpie is too finicky and sudden. No matter if he did\nknow the certain porter connected with our car and didn\u2019t wait for an\napology--he might \u2019a\u2019 sounded a warning.\n\nHe didn\u2019t hit the porter, but he would as soon as he got used to the\nsway of that car, \u2019cause his third shot busted the glass right by the\nporter\u2019s head.\n\nMaybe the conductor was right, and maybe he wasn\u2019t. Anyway, it\u2019s danged\nbad form to hop on to a man\u2019s back when he\u2019s trying to settle a personal\nmatter. Him and Magpie went down in the aisle, and everybody begins to\nexercise their lungs.\n\nBeing part and parcel of Magpie\u2019s crew, I immediate and soon bends my\ngun over the conductor\u2019s head. Folks will likely say that I was wrong,\nthat I had no interest in them yaller boots; but there\u2019s bound to be\nsome Sundays when Magpie won\u2019t wear \u2019em, and there ain\u2019t no law against\nme dressing up a little.\n\nWhat is politely known as consternation seems to prevail. Some folks\neven go so far as to try and hand us their valuables, while others seem\nto have the instinct of prairie-dogs and hunt a hole.\n\nThen the train jerks to a stop, which almost upsets me, and Magpie backs\ninto me, poking shells into his gun.\n\n\u201cGrab my bundle and get a-going,\u201d he yelps, and I obeyed him to the\nletter.\n\nThen we backs off that train. A brakeman heaves a hunk of coal at us and\nducks under the train, and from up by the express car comes the roar of\na shotgun, and a handful of buckshot seeps around us. We gets our\nbearings, and the way we went away from that train would make an\nantelope weep with envy. Then we sees the train pull out.\n\n\u201cMy ----!\u201d grunts Magpie. \u201cWe sure got some action, Ike!\u201d\n\n\u201c_Wa-a-a-a! Wa-a-a-a!_\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in ---- was that?\u201d whispers Magpie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say,\u201d says I, feeling a drop of cold sweat run right down my\nback-bone, \u201cI\u2019d say that your boots squeaked, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoots? I ain\u2019t got none on, Ike. Did you get that bundle?\u201d\n\nI sure did. It sort of wiggled in my hands; so I laid it down on the\nground.\n\n\u201c_Wa-a-a-a! Yah-a-a-a-a!_\u201d she goes again.\n\nMagpie rolled the bundle over with the muzzle of his gun, and then we\nstares at each other. Magpie pulls his long mustache and clears his\nthroat.\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d says he solemn-like, \u201cyou picked the wrong bundle. Beyond the\nshadder of a doubt you\u2019ve traded my boots for a baby.\u201d\n\nThe sinful thing I had done weighed upon my soul, and I felt bad. I\npictured the agonized mother setting there in that car, squeaking like a\nRed River cart when feeding time comes and she tries to nurse a pair of\nstained boots. Maybe she\u2019d recognize good leather and workmanship, but\nat a time like that you can\u2019t expect a mother to pay much attention to\ntanning and stitching on a pair of high-heeled boots--even if they did\ncost twenty dollars.\n\n\u201cGreat gosh!\u201d says I after due consideration. \u201cThis is awful!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sure is,\u201d agrees Magpie. \u201cI\u2019ll get my feet full of cactus.\u201d\n\n\u201cDang your feet! Think of what we\u2019ve done!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? What you\u2019ve done, Ike. Don\u2019t embroil me in it. Them boots cost me\nregular money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I after a while, \u201cwe\u2019re a pair of ---- fools!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk shop, Ike,\u201d he advises me weary-like, peering off into the\ngloom. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got any sympathy, use a little on me. I might step on\na rattlesnake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I knowed where one lived, I\u2019d lead you to it,\u201d I replies. \u201cShooting\nup a train is enough scandal for a pair of peace lovers from\nPiperock--without also getting arrested for kidnaping. If anybody ever\nsays yaller boots to me again, they\u2019d better pick a soft spot to land\non, \u2019cause they\u2019re sure going deep.\u201d\n\n\u201cPshaw! I hate it as much as you do, Ike. Figuring from a property\nstandpoint, I\u2019m a lot worse off than you are. In fact, you\u2019re two boots\nand a baby better off than I am.\u201d\n\nWe set there and peers off into the gloom. Here we are, dumped off in\nthe middle of the Bad Lands, night time, with no friendly beacon to\nguide us: one sockless, one brainless, and a baby--and all because\nMagpie prefers his boots yaller instead of black.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Magpie, \u201cI reckon we might as well mosey along, Ike. Come\non, family man.\u201d\n\nI picks up that squawking bundle of humanity, hitches up my belt and\nfollers Magpie over to the track, where we points north. I reckon we got\ndumped off in a country where there never was no cause to build a town.\n\nThen that offspring begins to raise its voice in protest. Sounded to me\nlike Andy Johnson trying to play sentimental music on a squeeze organ\nwhen he\u2019s full to the neck with hooch. I pikes along behind Magpie,\ntrying to keep my mind off that suffering bunch of misery. But it ain\u2019t\nno use.\n\n\u201cWhat do you reckon has got into the critter?\u201d I asks, and Magpie stops.\n\n\u201cA feller what don\u2019t know any more about babies than you do, Ike, sure\nis liable to mistake one for a pair of boots,\u201d says he sarcastic-like.\n\u201cThe thing is hungry. My gosh! What are you doing--carrying it upside\ndown? Give it to me! Feller like you hadn\u2019t ought to never pack a kid.\nPoor little jasper is hungry as ----!\u201d\n\n\u201cLikely starved to death,\u201d I agrees. \u201cBut that ain\u2019t no reason for you\nto use that kind of language before you finds out the sex. It\u2019s as much\nmy baby as yours, Magpie, and I ain\u2019t going to raise no female child to\nswear like a mule-skinner. _Sabe_? What\u2019s it hungry for?\u201d\n\n\u201cHungry for?\u201d\n\nMagpie stubs his toe and almost drops the baby.\n\n\u201cGosh dang the blasted luck!\u201d he yelps, \u201cTore a toe plumb off!\u201d\n\n\u201cHungry for what?\u201d I asks again.\n\n\u201cIke.\u201d Magpie stops limping and turns to me. \u201cIke, you ignorant\nimbecile, what do you reckon it\u2019s hungry for? Figure it\u2019s yelping for\nham and eggs?\u201d\n\n\u201cSensible yelp if it is,\u201d says I. \u201cWhat do babies hunger for, Magpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cM\u2019yah!\u201d grunts Magpie, which goes to show that he\u2019s an expert on baby\nfodder.\n\nWe pilgrims along for a while, and all to once I remembers something I\nread on a label once. Said it was fine for babies.\n\n\u201cCondensed milk!\u201d I snorts out loud.\n\nMagpie stops.\n\n\u201cJust struck you, did it?\u201d he says wise-like. \u201cTook you a long time.\nYessir, you guessed it, Ike. We\u2019ll give it a can of condensed milk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d says I. \u201cGive it a can, Magpie. If canned milk will stop\nthat racket, give it one for me. The twelve o\u2019clock whistle has blowed\nfor that kid an hour ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cIke, you\u2019re a ---- fool!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow who\u2019s talking shop?\u201d I asks sweet-like.\n\nOn we goes, Magpie limping and swearing every time he kicks a tie, and\nthe world getting darker and darker every step we take.\n\nBabies ain\u2019t got much sense, I reckon. Mostly any person or animal that\ncreeps, crawls or walks will pine for a thing for a certain length of\ntime, and, when it don\u2019t show in a reasonable period of pining, they\nforgets it; but a baby gets one idea in its bosom and cherishes said\nidea forever and ever, amen.\n\nThis one is too young for us to explain things to, and the night is too\ndark for us to hand it anything in sign-language; so we pilgrims along,\nlistening to it wail continuous for something to ease its stummick.\nPretty soon Magpie stops.\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d says he severe-like, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to find something to feed to\nthis infant. The blamed thing must be plumb empty, to wail thataway, and\nI won\u2019t poke along and let it die in my arms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got forty-three dollars, Magpie,\u201d says I, \u201cand I hereby gives you\npower of attorney to take my property to dinner. I\u2019m neither a wet-nurse\nnor a restaurant.\u201d\n\nWe pikes along for a while, baby wailing copiously. Then Magpie says--\n\n\u201cWonder if singing would help it any?\u201d\n\n\u201cMight as well wish for condensed milk,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cI might sing a little,\u201d says he apologetic-like.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says I. \u201cYou might. You never have--not in my hearing, Magpie.\nEven if your vocal efforts would please the child, it would be a heap\nnerve racking to me; so I votes in favor of the infant solo.\u201d\n\nThe baby keeps on playing three notes plumb across the board:\n\n\u201c_Wa-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a-a! Yah-a-a-a-a!_\u201d\n\nPretty soon Magpie stops and sets down on the rail.\n\n\u201cIke, I can\u2019t stand this,\u201d he wails. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get condensed milk\nfor this human phonygraft, or it will ruin its lungs.\u201d\n\nWe sets there in the dark and contemplates deep-like. Off in the\ndistance a coyote raises its voice in protest against the bounty law,\nand then a cow bawls soft-like.\n\n\u201cMy ----!\u201d grunts Magpie prayerful-like. \u201cCow! Don\u2019t they make condensed\nmilk out of cow milk, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you think they made it out of cans?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cCow!\u201d he grunted joyful-like, getting to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll milk that\ncritter, Ike.\u201d\n\nHe picks up our painful inheritance, pilgrims down the railroad fill,\nand we goes in the direction of that cow\u2019s voice. We finds said bawlers\nstanding in the corner of a fence, and they acts inquisitive toward us.\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t got no rope, Magpie,\u201d I objects. But he\u2019s enthusiastic over\nthe proposition and says:\n\n\u201cMilk cows ain\u2019t wild, Ike. All you\u2019ve got to do is to corner \u2019em.\n_Sabe?_ You hold this starving infant while Uncle Dudley plays\nmilkmaid.\u201d\n\nHe crawls over the fence and approaches the herd. I\u2019ll admit that Magpie\nhas a soothing voice, and his \u201cSo-o-o, boss,\u201d would assure most anything\nof his good intentions. But them cows ain\u2019t used to having strangers\ncome out of the night to steal their juice. They sort of mills around\nand acts foreign to his designs.\n\n\u201cMake that kid shut up!\u201d he yelps. \u201cIt\u2019s scaring the critters, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t no murderer,\u201d says I. \u201cThere is things that nothing short of\nsudden death will stop. Hurry up with the nourishment.\u201d\n\nI hears a cow bawl, and then comes a rattle, a bump and a curse.\n\n\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d I asks.\n\nPretty soon I hears Magpie spit audible-like, and then:\n\n\u201cDang the luck! Tried to bulldog a muley cow!\u201d\n\nBulldogging is the gentle pastime of getting in front of a cow, getting\none arm under a horn and the other arm over a horn and then twisting the\ncritter\u2019s neck until said critter decides to lay down. Muley cows are\nexempt on account of not having any horns.\n\nThe baby seems to sympathize openly with the cows. In fact, that kid has\nthe only perpetual voice I ever heard.\n\n\u201cHurry up with that milk!\u201d I yelps.\n\nI hears somebody swearing sweet and low; a cow grunts deep-like, and\nthen comes a dull thud.\n\n\u201c_Wa-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a!_\u201d wails the kid.\n\n\u201cWoof!\u201d I hears Magpie grunt and then, \u201cCome huh-here! Got \u2019um!\u201d\n\nI lays the baby down on the ground and crawls through the fence. A cow\nsticks its cold nose in my face in the dark and uses my necktie for a\nhandkerchief.\n\n\u201cWhere you got \u2019um?\u201d I asks, peering around.\n\n\u201cHuh-here, Ike.\u201d\n\nI peers closer and finds Magpie down on his shoulders, with a cow\u2019s head\nin his arms. The rest of the animal is making useless jerks, trying to\nget loose.\n\n\u201cMum-milk it,\u201d he stutters.\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d says I. \u201cWhat in?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in?\u201d he grunts. \u201cIn your huh-hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike ----! In my new Stetson? Not any milk, thanks. Give me your hat,\nMagpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cLost it. You danged-- Sh-h-h-h!\u201d\n\nThen we heard footsteps approaching on horseback. Up that line fence\ncomes some indistinct shapes. We hears the creak of saddles, and then\nsomebody curses a loose cinch. They stops right near to us, and we holds\nthe cow and our breaths.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t do much until daylight,\u201d opines a voice. \u201cNever catch anything\nbusting around in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t you got that cinch fixed yet, Mort?\u201d asks another voice.\n\n\u201c_Wa-a-a-a-a!_\u201d\n\nWe hears a couple of broncs move quick. Somebody swears.\n\n\u201cWhat in made that noise?\u201d grunts somebody.\n\n\u201cRabbit, I reckon,\u201d chuckles the feller who is fixing his cinch. \u201cYou\u2019re\na fine posse. Like a nervous bunch of old women. Well, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThey drifts away in the dark, and me and Magpie wipes the perspiration\noff our brows.\n\n\u201cThank the Lord for the little rabbits!\u201d grunts Magpie. \u201cNow get busy on\nthe dairy proposition, Ike. I\u2019ll buy you a new hat.\u201d\n\nI ain\u2019t no milkmaid. All my life I\u2019ve punched cows, prospected, gambled\na little and played deputy to Magpie while he was sheriff. I\u2019ve always\nput milk in the same class with water--meek and mild. I\u2019m not qualified\nto pail a cow--not even gentle cows, but under the existing\ncircumstances I tries to do my duty.\n\nThe baby raises its voice in discords; so I hurries to get it a grub\nstake.\n\nMagpie is holding firm; so I takes off my new hat and kneels down on the\nground. Then I got up on my feet, walked around to the other end of the\ncritter and told Magpie what I thought of him as a cow-man. We had a\nhard time letting that critter loose without it doing us bodily harm,\nand then we crawled back through the fence, and Magpie picked up our\naudible off-spring.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says he, \u201cthere\u2019s one steer that will have something to think\nabout for a while, even if I did lose a sock and some skin. Wonder who\nthe posse was after?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot us,\u201d says I, holding my hands over my ears to shut out the wails of\nmisery coming from that bundle. \u201cWhere in thunder do we find something\nto appease that kid\u2019s appetite?\u201d\n\n\u201cGawd only knows,\u201d says he solemn-like, limping along in the dark. \u201cIf\nit dies, you\u2019re a murderer, Ike. I\u2019m doing all I can to save both of\nyour lives.\u201d\n\nThen we saw a light. Over to the left of us comes a flicker from a cabin\nwindow. Magpie turns like the needle of a compass and points straight\nfor the flicker.\n\n\u201cWhere there\u2019s light, there\u2019s succor,\u201d says Magpie.\n\n\u201cAnd, where it\u2019s dark, there\u2019s two,\u201d I replies, and we pilgrims along,\nlistening to our accidental inheritance howl itself hoarse.\n\nWe seen some folks ride away from the open door before we got there; so\nwe waited until they are gone.\n\n\u201cShall we go right in and demand a can of milk?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a scheme, Ike,\u201d says he wise-like. \u201cI\u2019ll go in alone with the\nbaby. _Sabe?_ I needs boots as bad as this kid needs food, and maybe I\ncan get both. I\u2019ll tell \u2019em my wife died way back in the timber and that\nI\u2019m trying to get back to civilization with my child. I\u2019ll harp on their\nheartstrings until they feeds the baby and shoes Magpie. You hang\naround, Ike. If we both went in, there\u2019d be too much to explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour scheme sounds good,\u201d says I. \u201cPlay her plumb across the board.\nDon\u2019t refuse to take a sandwich along if they offers it, \u2019cause Ike\nHarper is about to wail for food, too.\u201d\n\nMagpie limps up to the door and knocks, while I sets down on the fence\nand rolls a smoke. The night seems peaceful since the wailing of the\ninfant has ceased, and I feel sort of free-like. Being a father must\ntake a lot of responsibility.\n\nPretty soon I gets a hankering to see what\u2019s going on in there. I sneaks\nto a side window and peeks in. I can\u2019t get much of a view, but I can see\nthis much: Magpie has got his hands above his head and a resigned look\nin his lean face. In front of him is a mean-looking _hombre_ with a\nshotgun in his hands, and behind him stands a capable-looking female\nwith the meanest face I ever seen.\n\nThen I hears the feller say to the woman:\n\n\u201cYou take this gun and keep him setting right there, Violet, and I\u2019ll go\nafter the posse. They ain\u2019t gone very far.\u201d\n\nI leans against the wall and wonders out loud what kind of a place\nMagpie has got into. Then the door opens, and the feller hops out and\nbeats it for the stable. A minute later I hears him ride away. I hears\nthe female say something to Magpie about him deserving something worse\nthan hanging. I\u2019ve wished the same thing on Magpie lots of times, but\nunder the circumstances I can\u2019t let out the job. It ain\u2019t noways safe to\nbust into that door and get the insides of a shotgun in my mainspring;\nso I pokes around the cabin for a better way.\n\n\u201c_Wa-a-a-a! Yah-a-a-a-a!_\u201d comes a voice from inside near where I\u2019m\nfussing with a window.\n\nIt sure gives me an idea. Without the evidence--if the kid is\nevidence--they can\u2019t do no more than let Magpie loose. So I slips the\nwindow open easy-like and slips over the sill.\n\nIt\u2019s almighty dark in there, but I can see a thread of light shining\nthrough the crack in the door, and I hears the woman say:\n\n\u201cSet still, you villain! You deserve everything you\u2019ve got coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bow to superior wisdom, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Magpie.\n\nJust then I finds what I seek. It gives a little squeak as I pick it up,\nbut I hugs it to my bosom and starts for the window--and then I stepped\non a dog!\n\nLooking back on the episode, I\u2019m of the opinion that the dog must \u2019a\u2019\nbeen deaf, dumb and blind--but not suffering from lockjaw. Maybe it was\none of them family heirlooms you\u2019ll find now and then laying around in a\ncabin, soaking up heat and odorizing the atmosphere with every smell\nthat old dog age is heir to. Anyway, this dog still retained its\nyouthful audibility and a certain degree of mastication, \u2019cause it\ngrabbed me by the leg just above my boot and hung on.\n\nSuch a condition made it hard for Ike Harper to show much speed. Here I\nam with a baby in my arms, a dog half-way up my lap filling the air with\nchoking barks, and me trying to tip myself over far enough to fall out\nof the window.\n\nI\u2019ve got my belt line over the sill when the door flies open and a voice\nyelps--\n\n\u201cSic\u2019 \u2019em, Nero!\u201d\n\nNero didn\u2019t need any urging. In fact, I don\u2019t reckon that Nero ever\nheard her, \u2019cause he was doing his little best without any cheers from\nthe weaker sex.\n\nI manages to twist myself over on my back, swing my free leg up\nhigh--which gave me added weight on my outside end--and just as I sways\ntoward the earth I feels the hot breath of a shotgun pass over me. Nero\nlet loose. I reckon that Nero died with the taste of the best sourdough\non earth on his palate.\n\nThe top of my boot got fringed plentiful, and some of the shot cut fancy\ndesigns on my knee-cap. But me and the kid landed in a heap, and I\u2019d\ntell a man that we didn\u2019t waste no time going away.\n\nI shoved on some extra speed, which enabled me to clear the fence, and\nthen I runs right into Magpie. We both grunts a greeting and lopes away\ntogether. We puts a mile or more between us and that shack and then\nstops to get our wind.\n\n\u201cClose call!\u201d puffs Magpie. \u201cBy cripes! Posse hunting for a kidnaper.\nHalf-witted sheepherder swiped a feller\u2019s kid \u2019cause the woman wouldn\u2019t\nfeed him. Man back there knowed him by sight, and he identifies me as\nbeing the shepherd. Said he was the same length and had hair on his\nface.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust \u2019a\u2019 been mistaken, Magpie,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cWish I\u2019d a left the baby there,\u201d says he, after a while. \u201cWish I had,\nIke. Reckon they\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 found the owner.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wish you had?\u201d I asks. \u201cDid you say \u2018wish you had?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. Could easy, Ike. When that female heard the noise in the other\nroom, she ignored me; so I grabs the kid and ducked out.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ----!\u201d says I. \u201cYou got a baby with you, Magpie?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Wa-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a!_\u201d comes from over by Magpie.\n\n\u201cYah-a-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a-a!\u201d comes from my arms.\n\nNeither one of us has anything to say. In fact there ain\u2019t nothing to be\nsaid. The insides of me are wondering whether I\u2019m going to cuss or cry.\nI feel like somebody had pushed me out of a balloon.\n\nPretty soon Magpie says soft-like:\n\n\u201cTwins! Wasn\u2019t one enough, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo many,\u201d I agrees weak-like. \u201cOne was too many, Magpie. If Sherman\nhad twins, he\u2019d never knowed there was a war.\u201d\n\nWhere we\u2019d only had a solo, we\u2019ve now got a duet. If anything, the last\none had a higher voice than the first one and used several more notes.\nIt also seemed to get its second wind long after the first one had\nstopped to pump air.\n\nWe sets there in the dark and listens. A couple of coyotes off on a\nlittle butte tries to sing their opening song, but their voices are\ndrowned by the voices of children, and they sneaks away in disgust.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to take it back,\u201d states Magpie sad-like. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be\ndone, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith due caution,\u201d I agrees. \u201cThat female is a wing-shot, if you asks\nme, Magpie. Also, that posse might be there. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\nWe sets there in the dark as long as we can stand the wailing, and, when\nour nerves give out, we gets up and looks around.\n\n\u201cWhich way lieth the shack?\u201d inquires Magpie. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take that\nlast kid back home.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know which way we came. It\u2019s so dark that I can hardly see\nMagpie, who is right beside me. From the north comes a feel of storm,\nand a little rumble from above seems to ask us if we ain\u2019t got sense\nenough to come in out of the rain.\n\n\u201cStanding here ain\u2019t going to do nothing for us,\u201d states Magpie. \u201cWe may\npoint wrong and get nowhere, but our intentions are good.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us hope we strike a dairy,\u201d says I, and we plods along again.\n\nThe Lord only knows where we went, and He likely didn\u2019t pay much\nattention. We just traveled regardless, follering the lines of least\nresistance. Magpie has got so he ignores his bare feet. I reckon a\nfeller\u2019s feet can get just so full of cactus and stone-bruises that\nnothing can hurt \u2019em any more.\n\nWe drifted down a dry creek bed just as the rain began to come down on\nour unprotected heads. Then we went hunting for a tree to get under. All\nto once Magpie stops, and I bump into him. I hears horses smashing\nthrough the brush. Somebody whoops, and a shot is fired. Then the noise\ndrifts off down the gulch.\n\n\u201cPosse,\u201d informs Magpie.\n\n\u201cDid you think I\u2019d mistake it for a duck hunt?\u201d I asks.\n\nThem kids act like we wasn\u2019t paying enough attention to them; so they\nstarts another kindergarten grand opery.\n\n\u201cKeep your kid still!\u201d hisses Magpie. \u201cWant the posse to find us?\u201d\n\n\u201cMake your own shut up!\u201d I snaps right back at him, and just then we\nwalks right into a wall.\n\n\u201cShack!\u201d grunts Magpie.\n\n\u201cOne wall, at least,\u201d I agrees. \u201cLet us foregather within and shun the\nrain.\u201d\n\nWe sneaked around to the door, which is not locked, and went in. It\u2019s so\ndark in there that we can\u2019t see a thing, and I bumps into a bunk. I\ndeposits my infant on the bunk and goes hunting for something to make a\nlight.\n\n\u201cMatches all wet!\u201d wailed Magpie. \u201cGot any dry ones, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo. But, before I find out if they\u2019re dry, I\u2019m going to find something\nto set on fire.\u201d\n\nThen I fell over a box and hit my head on the floor. That made me sore.\nI got up and kicked the box as hard as I could.\n\n\u201cCut that out!\u201d yelps Magpie. \u201cWho hit me with that box? Who threw it?\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d I howls. \u201cNobody threw it-- I kicked it! Reckon I tore a toe\nplumb off. Next time I----\u201d\n\n\u201cSh-h-h-h!\u201d hisses Magpie. \u201cSomebody coming! Let\u2019s get out.\u201d\n\nHe swung the door open and ducked out in the storm. That\u2019s just like\nMagpie. In danger he forgets his responsibility, and Ike Harper, who is\nvery cool, picks up the two babies off the bunk and follers in his wake.\nMan, it sure was pouring out there. Ever\u2019 once in a while comes a flash\nof lightning, which is fine while she lasts but harder when she\u2019s gone.\nI sure flounders around a lot.\n\n\u201cThis way, Ike!\u201d yelps Magpie, and I follers the best I can.\n\nA flash of light shows me a couple of fellers on horseback milling\naround in the rain, and then we sure hit the high spots out of there.\n\nAfter a mile or so we stops in the shelter of a washout and puffs\nplentiful.\n\n\u201cSuffering sidewinders!\u201d groans Magpie. \u201cI ain\u2019t got no feet left!\nHonest to grandma, I\u2019m a wreck from stem to stern, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cFeller sufferer, I know how you feel,\u201d says I. \u201cBut that ain\u2019t no\nreason for you to forget what you owes to humanity. I don\u2019t wish to\nchide no man for being absent-minded, Magpie, but I\u2019m asking why you\nleft me the responsibility of both offsprings in this direful\ne-mergency?\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning what?\u201d he groans.\n\n\u201cMagpie Simpkins, do you mean to set there shivering and tell me that\nyou got so scared that you forgot we had two suffering infants when we\nentered that cabin?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ----!\u201d he grunts. \u201cYou didn\u2019t forget yours, did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but you did, Mister Simpkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike ----! I\u2019ve got mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I after due consideration, \u201csomebody did. I\u2019ve got two.\u201d\n\nAnd then three voices blended in the night air. The last one seemed to\nbe a little bit stronger than the others.\n\n\u201cSuffering sidewinders!\u201d wails Magpie. \u201cWhere did the last one come\nfrom? I thought this was a cow country and I finds it\u2019s kids. Hungry\nkids! Aw-w-w-w, shut up!\u201d\n\nThey did. Magpie got up on his feet and fussed with a damp\ncigaret-paper.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to show \u2019em who\u2019s boss, Ike,\u201d he states. \u201cThey recognizes\nthe voice of authority, and, believe me, I know how to quell \u2019em. Now\nwe\u2019ve got to take \u2019em home.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe it ever so humble,\u201d I agrees.\n\nThen we pokes out into the damp night, Magpie ahead with the tenor and\nme behind, with the soprano and alto. It is becoming some perade, if you\nasks me.\n\nThey may be sweet little darlings--we ain\u2019t never gazed upon their\nfaces--but I know that what I\u2019ve called \u2019em under my breath ain\u2019t going\nto be of great cheer to \u2019em in the life to come.\n\nAbout a mile farther on we sees the lights of a house and points our\nperade accordingly. We\u2019re too miserable to think of anything except\nmaking a wholesale delivery. Maybe Magpie had a vision of a pair of\nboots; I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cDo we lie to them about things, Magpie?\u201d I asks as we nears the place.\n\n\u201cWe do not, Ike. No more lies. A certain measure of precaution but not a\nprevarication. I won\u2019t be the father of triplets--not barefooted.\u201d\n\nWe stumbles right up to the door. Magpie hammers on the middle panel\nwith the butt of his six-shooter.\n\nA feller sticks his head out of the door and stares at us. He\u2019s got a\nface like a full moon.\n\n\u201cAhem!\u201d says Magpie. \u201cHave you got any babies?\u201d\n\n_Bang!_ He slammed the door in our face, and we hears him drop a bar\nacross it. Then from the window we hears:\n\n\u201cMosey, you bums! Hop out or pick lead out of your hide the rest of your\nlives.\u201d\n\nWe went. Also and moreover we went fast.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing--taking the census?\u201d I asks when we\u2019re\nout of shotgun range and stops to gather our wind.\n\n\u201cWhat do you reckon I ought to have asked him--if he wanted any babies?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy speak of them at all? We could \u2019a\u2019 sneaked in and then came away\nwithout \u2019em, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? You never have, Ike. You usually add instead of subtract; so I\u2019m\nmaking a few inquiries before I take a chance. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\nWe pilgrims along for a while sort of aimless-like.\n\n\u201cWhere had we ought to go now?\u201d wonders Magpie.\n\n\u201c----!\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cBrilliant thought,\u201d agrees Magpie. \u201cThey say that all babies are\nangels; so so you\u2019d be safe--that\u2019s a cinch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t wear yaller boots there; so that would help some,\u201d says I.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances I reckon we would have argued the point;\nbut the triplets start a concert, and we decides to pilgrim on. The rain\nstill visits the earth, and, if you think it\u2019s any cinch trying to walk\nin the dark with rain in your eyes and a squalling baby on each arm,\nyou\u2019re all wrong.\n\nPretty soon Magpie stops.\n\n\u201cIke, I see another light. It may mean disaster, and it may mean\ndeliverance. Shall we try it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAny port in a storm, Magpie. Lead us to the light. My arms are cramped,\nand my ear-drums are sore, but I\u2019m game for anything from milk to\nmurder.\u201d\n\nMagpie is some pilot, if you asks me. We drifted into a section of\nplowed ground which has got soaked with rain, and it hung to our feet\nlike molasses. I sat down twice during the voyage, and we sure are a\nsticky-looking mess when we arrive at the door of that forlorn-looking\nshack.\n\nMagpie knocks on the door. After a while we hears a commotion inside,\nand the door opens. The face that leans out to us looks like a busted\nmattress. The hair on it seems to grow straight ahead like the quills on\na peevish porkypine.\n\n\u201cMilk?\u201d pronounces Magpie.\n\nThe bushy-faced person seemed to take it under consideration.\n\n\u201cMilk?\u201d says Magpie again.\n\n\u201c_Vizoffvufforskilloff?_\u201d he asks deep-like.\n\nThe babies renew their concert, and the carbonated critter stretches his\nneck a little longer.\n\n\u201c_Mffvuffzizzskoyiffsky?_\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cAll three of em are.\u201d\n\nThe feller nods and spits out into the rain.\n\n\u201cMilk,\u201d states Magpie. \u201cMilk for the babies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeebus?\u201d he asks. \u201c_Skilloffvizzmffovitch?_\u201d\n\nThen he stepped back into the room.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could talk Russian, Magpie,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cLot of things you don\u2019t know, Ike. Now we\u2019ll get the----\u201d\n\nComes a lot of charged language and couple of squalls, and here comes\nBushy-Face with a squalling infant on each arm. He stops in the doorway,\nand his haystack whiskers open in a wide grin.\n\n\u201c_Zoffuffzizzovitckski_,\u201d says he proud-like.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d says Magpie foolish-like. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome as the\nflowers in May.\u201d\n\nThen he walks right away from there, leading me by the arm.\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I asks as we fall through a pole fence and skid out\ninto another plowed field.\n\n\u201c----!\u201d snorts Magpie, tearing the seat of his pants out of the mud,\nwhere he had sunk about a foot. \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure, but I think he\nwanted to bet that his two could yelp louder than all three of ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d says I. \u201cI\u2019ve got forty-three dollars that says mine\nalone can out-yelp anything on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d lose,\u201d says Magpie sad-like. \u201cI\u2019ve got a high-class yelper myself\nSweepstake entries, Ike.\u201d\n\nThen came the cows. Range cows are funny critters and have strange and\nawful ideas on men on foot. The first thing we knowed we\u2019re plumb\nsurrounded there in the dark and they\u2019re closing in on all sides,\nrattling their horns, talking low and doing other things that don\u2019t make\nus feel absolutely safe.\n\n\u201cStand perfectly still, Ike,\u201d whispers Magpie. \u201cThey\u2019ll think we are\npart of the secenery.\u201d\n\nWe groups together and looks as much like inanimate objects as possible.\nThe cows sniffs and grunts all around, wondering in cow talk what kind\nof a growth we are. Then Magpie\u2019s armful opens up--\n\n\u201c_Wa-a-a-a! Wa-a-a-a!_\u201d\n\n\u201cMa-a-a-a-a! Yah-a-a-a-a!\u201d sings mine together.\n\nThen I got kicked by a cow. Absolutely! The critter was so close to me\nwhen the chorus opens up that, when it whirls and starts to run, I got\nboth hind feet in the calves of my legs.\n\nThey\u2019re so close to me that I says my evening prayer. Magpie lets a\nwhoop out of his system--\n\n\u201cGrab one by the tail, Ike, and play safe!\u201d\n\nAnd then I gets a glimpse of his fish-pole figure disappearing out of\nthe main herd, swinging on to the tail of a scared cow.\n\nI\u2019ve got a fat chance, with both arms full. I backs into a mesquite\nbush, shifts both babies to one arm and pulls my gun.\n\nMan, I sure smoked up them fool cows, and they stampeded. One went past\nme so fast that the wind blew me backward, and, when I got my whole\nfamily together again, there ain\u2019t a cow in sight.\n\nI yelps loud and long for Magpie, but he\u2019s likely still hanging on to\nthat critter and pointed for parts unknown.\n\nThen I plods on alone--that is, there\u2019s only three of us now. I\u2019m sick\nin soul and body, and all I wants on this earth or the waters under the\nearth is a place to leave my bundles.\n\nI got hung up on a barbed wire fence, losing a few inches of skin and my\nhopes for a reward in the hereafter, and all this time them two are\nkeeping up a cross-fire of complaint. I tries to argue it out with \u2019em\nand then cautions myself out loud not to go too far, \u2019cause that\u2019s what\ngets folks into the loco lodge.\n\nThen I sees another light. Ike Harper ought to be getting skittish about\nlights, but he\u2019s so near unto death that he loses his normal caution.\nIke Harper is now a man unafraid.\n\nI shifts the babies to one arm, grasps my empty gun in my right hand and\nhammers plentiful on that door.\n\nMy knock don\u2019t seem to awaken no response; so I walks inside. There\u2019s a\nlamp burning on the table, but nobody is in sight. I lays them\noffsprings on the bed and flops my aching bones into a chair.\n\nMy fingers are too stiff to even attempt to roll a smoke, and my arms\nare paralyzed. As soon as them kids hit the bed, they seems to ease off\non the wailing, and my ears gets a needed rest. I sets there for a\nwhile, getting more normal all the time, and, when I hear noises\noutside, my nature asserts itself, and I crawls under the bed. Somebody\nis coming; my gun is empty, and I don\u2019t feel like thinking up a lie.\n\nHere they come, swearing and rattling. The door slams open, and they all\nclumps inside.\n\n\u201cWife\u2019s over at Jones\u2019,\u201d states a voice which comes in behind the bunch.\n\u201cShe slipped and sprained her ankle, Zeb.\u201d\n\nSeveral voices seems to all talk to once, but I seem to gather that\nsomebody has been caught and deserves hanging. I sees a pair of big bare\nfeet and a torn pants leg. When I peeks out a little more, I sees a rope\nhanging from above the feet.\n\n\u201cThis is sure going hard with you, feller!\u201d says a voice above the rest.\n\nThen I hears Magpie\u2019s voice, resigned-like:\n\n\u201cWhy say \u2018hard\u2019? Human beings can\u2019t hand me nothing more than I\u2019ve\nalready been through.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere! Keep them dogs out of here!\u201d yelps a voice. \u201cDanged bloodhounds\nwill track this carpet all up! Get under the bunk! Danged lop-earned\ntrailers!\u201d\n\nThey got under the bunk, all right. Four of \u2019em! All muddy and sloppy\nand full of affection, and they sure licked Ike Harper\u2019s face around and\naround, upside down and crossways. They guzzled in my ears and rubbed\nnoses with me, and I had to take it. After my bath they seems to sort of\nquiet down, and I hears what the men are saying.\n\n\u201cNo; the kid\u2019s all right,\u201d states somebody. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s hungry.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor little Oscar!\u201d squeaks some feller. \u201cLemme see him, Zeb. I ain\u2019t\nnever see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing, Otie. Never seen Oscar, eh?\u201d\n\nComes a shuffling of feet, somebody clears their throat, and then\nsilence. Even them danged hounds seem to feel the silence. Then I hears\nsomebody clear their throat apologetic-like and say:\n\n\u201cMister, I--I--we begs your pardon. Take that rope off him, Abe. Your\nstory didn\u2019t sound like much to us; so-- Well, dang it all, we\u2019re sorry,\nmister. Honest to gosh we are. Ain\u2019t we, fellers?\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch is Gospel,\u201d agrees somebody else. \u201cFrom now on I believes what I\nhears. Take your baby, old trailer, and go free as air. There ain\u2019t\nnobody doubting your honesty. Our mistake.\u201d\n\nI hears a shuffling noise; the door shuts soft-like, and then all is\nsilence again.\n\n\u201c----!\u201d says somebody. \u201cDon\u2019t seem possible that it wasn\u2019t one or the\nother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m plumb glad my wife wasn\u2019t able to come home,\u201d states a voice, which\nI reckon is the father of one of my bunch. \u201cThe shock might \u2019a\u2019 killed\nher.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Wa-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a-a!_\u201d\n\nEven the bloodhounds got excited, and I got licked all over again. A\nfeller can protect himself from one dog\u2019s affections, but, when four get\nhim down under a bed and set on his chest, he ain\u2019t got much show.\n\n\u201cGee mighty gosh, this is little Oscar!\u201d yelps one of them fellers,\ndancing a jig.\n\n\u201cThis one is Pete Patton\u2019s Emmeline!\u201d yelps another. \u201cPete, this is your\nEmmeline! Gee-lory!\u201d\n\nEverything gets sort of mulliganed again. The place is filled with so\nmuch joy that the hounds get infected, and they sure scrubbed my face\nplentiful again.\n\n\u201cGoing to take Oscar right over to the wife!\u201d whoops a voice.\n\n\u201cFoller me and Emmeline!\u201d yelps the other. \u201cCome on, boys! I know where\nthere\u2019s a keg of ten-year-old hooch. Come on!\u201d\n\nNobody invited me and the dogs. As soon as everybody is gone, I crawls\nout of there. Them four man-trailers looks at me with such solemn\nexpressions in their sad eyes that I ain\u2019t got the heart to chide \u2019em.\n\n\u201cYou pups want to go with me?\u201d I asks, and they wags their tails.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d says I. \u201cI never did like to wash my own face.\u201d\n\nWe pilgrims out into the rain, and after a while we hit the railroad\ntrack again. It ain\u2019t good walking, but a railroad track will get\nyou some place if you foller it long enough. And that\u2019s what I did.\nI ain\u2019t had nothing to eat for so long that I\u2019m beginning to wish\nfor something--even milk.\n\nThen comes daylight. I\u2019d say that Ike Harper ain\u2019t much to look at. He\nain\u2019t got no hat, and the real estate lieth thick upon him. Some sheep\nare drifting along, and I finds the shepherd standing on the track. As I\ncome up, he grins and says--\n\n\u201cLookin\u2019 fer a baby?\u201d\n\nMy gun was empty, but rocks are plentiful. I chased that shepherd across\ncountry until one of my hounds runs between my legs and tripped me. Then\nI went back to the track and pilgrimed on.\n\nLater on I comes to a town, which is what will happen to anybody if they\nfollers a railroad long enough. I pilgrims up to the depot. In the shade\nof the building I sees a familiar figure setting on the edge of the\nplatform. I sets down beside him.\n\nThere\u2019s some crackers and cheese and sardines scattered around him, and\nI helps myself, while I watches him try to get his feet into a pair of\nnew boots--yaller boots, too.\n\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I asks.\n\nBut he yanks the boots away and sets on \u2019em.\n\n\u201cNot this pair!\u201d he snorts, producing a pair of tweezers.\n\nI watches him dig out a few more cactus spines and then try to get a\nnumber seventeen foot into a number twelve boot. He groans, puts the\nboots away and slips a pair of moccasins on his feet. Then he sighs and\nrolls a smoke.\n\n\u201cI delivered Oscar and Emmeline,\u201d says I.\n\nHe squints at me and nods solemn-like. Then he says:\n\n\u201cI gave George Washington to his maw.\u201d\n\nWe both nods. Then pretty soon he says--\n\n\u201cShe got off the train to mail a letter, and the train pulled out and\nleft her here. She wired to Cut Bank, which is the next stop, but the\ndanged telegraph system got caught in the storm and lost its voice.\nShe\u2019s been whooping it up and down this here platform ever since. She\nhugged me seventeen times, Ike, when she finds it belongs to her, and I\nreckon I--I hugged her some, too.\u201d\n\nI finished up the rest of the lunch. Magpie got to his feet.\n\n\u201cWant to show you something, Ike.\u201d\n\nHe limped around to the door of the depot, and I follered him. Near the\ndoor he stops and points at the floor. There\u2019s a wet spot and a lot of\nbusted glass. One piece of glass is still holding on to a rubber\nmouthpiece.\n\n\u201cKnow what that is?\u201d he asks.\n\nI shakes my head.\n\n\u201cBottle,\u201d says he wise-like. \u201cBottle which contained milk for Georgie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the answer, Magpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I gave Georgie to his maw, that bottle fell out of his blanket.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ----!\u201d says I. \u201cWas it there all the time?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see anybody put it there, did you?\u201d he asks sarcastic-like.\n\nWe sat down on the edge of the platform and communed with our thoughts.\nAfter a while I says:\n\n\u201cMagpie, it\u2019s easy to figure that the kidnaper got scared and left that\nbaby in that shack, but what I don\u2019t understand is this: All little\nbabies being more or less alike in the face, how in ---- did them men\nknow at a glance that your baby wasn\u2019t little Oscar?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh! I never seen Oscar myself, Ike, but I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 known it wasn\u2019t Oscar.\nLittle Georgie\u2019s father was the porter that blacked my yaller boots,\nIke.\u201d\n\nTHE END",
