    "body": "They dropped the raider on the night side, less than thirty miles from\nThanlar, the capitol city. The dark, slim ship drifted silently to the\nground, discharged its passenger and lifted again, moving slowly like\na great shark in the night. On the way out into space, it was caught\nby the defense screens of Thanlar and disappeared in a gout of flaming\nenergy that lit up the entire night sky.\n\nThe raider did not see it; he was already asleep.\n\nHe slept, and his dreams were troubled by images of a familiar face.\nStrong cheekbones, the mane of white hair, the famous half-smile of\nMayne Landing, Earth Commissioner to the Colony Planets. Mayne Landing,\nthe gentle representative of Terra to her children, the kindly old\ngentleman with the fist of steel, the benevolent despot over a hundred\nColony Planets.\n\nMayne Landing: victim.\n\nThe raider woke with the dawn, a dawn that was slightly more red-tinged\nthan the sun he was used to. He gathered his small store of equipment\ntogether and cached it in the low scrub of the surrounding forest. By a\nclear, sparkling stream he washed, wincing slightly from the shock of\nthe too-cold water against his face.\n\nHe wore clothes indistinguishable from the other farmers of this\ndistrict, slightly shabby, a uniform dun color. They did not fit him\nwell, but they could not hide the wide shoulder and slim waist. Well,\nit didn't matter: the farmers of this planet, like all the Colonies,\nhad to work hard to scrape their meager living from the rocky soil.\nThey were all in good condition; he would not be conspicuous.\n\nHe finished washing and dried himself on the sleeve of his jumper. Then\nhe began to walk down the rocky hill to the village that stood in the\ntiny valley below. In the early sun, the tiny assemblage of white clean\nhouses sparkled like a handful of sand-polished shells clustered on a\nbeach. He stopped for a moment, halfway down, looking at the village.\n\nIt was a nice little place, he thought. Peaceful in the early light,\ncalm. There were a few people moving about the streets, probably\nfarmers early on their way to the fields. It was a pastoral scene, like\nsomething he had read in a book a long time ago.\n\n_Nice_, he thought. _Quiet. I wonder what it will be like when I'm\nfinished here._\n\nIt didn't pay to think about things like that. Not in his business.\n\nHe let his eyes shift slightly to take in the tall towers of Thanlar,\njust visible over the crest of hills on the other side of the valley.\nThanlar, the capitol. That was his concern. That was what he had to\nthink about, not the village.\n\nHe sighed once, started down the hill again, walking slowly, picking\nhis way through the loose rocks with care.\n\nAs he neared the village, he passed several crews of men going out into\nthe fields. He greeted them in Interlingua, and they replied shortly,\nwithout curiosity. He knew he was a stranger to them; they did not\nrecognize him, but they showed no curiosity. These days, curiosity was\nnot much advantage to anyone, he thought. The farmers had probably\nlearned long ago not to show too much interest in any stranger who\nsuddenly appeared from nowhere.\n\nHe came into the village and walked quickly to the faded wooden sign\nthat announced, TAILOR. Entering the little shop, more a general\ndry-goods store than a tailor, he moved to the rear, to a small\ncounter. No one was there, and he rang the bell on the counter.\n\nAfter a moment, a man appeared, hastily buttoning a tunic, his hair\nstill tousled, sleep in his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, yes? What is it? You are too early.\"\n\n\"My apologies, old man,\" said the raider. \"I am looking for a hunting\ncloak.\"\n\nThe small man's eyes narrowed. \"Ah,\" he said. \"A hunting cloak. I have\nseveral. What did you have in mind.\"\n\n\"Something in gray. To suit my name.\"\n\n\"Ah. And what might you be hunting, Mr.--Gray?\"\n\n\"An animal of my home planet. It is called a jackal.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nThe old man suddenly turned from the low rack of cloaks and stared\ndirectly at his customer. His mouth compressed in a thin, bitter line.\n\n\"So. You are he. The Mr. Gray who hunts the jackal. Come.\"\n\nHe turned and led the way into his living quarters behind the counter.\n\n\"I will tell the others you are here,\" he said. He left through a rear\ndoor, leaving the raider to wander about the tiny room, inspecting\nit without interest. He had seen too many like it in the past five\nyears to be interested. Dingy little rooms in the back of a store,\ninsect-ridden chambers in public lodgings, shack in the backwoods\noutside a city, too many, too many. And never a place to rest.\n\n_After this one_, he promised himself. _After this one._\n\nSoon the little tailor came back, and there were two others with him.\nOne was a ferret-eyed little man with a suspicious stare, the other a\nheavy-set farmer. The heavy-set man had a scythe in his hand, he had\napparently been on his way to his fields when the tailor found him. He\nheld the scythe tightly, and the raider could see he was very nervous.\nIt was probably the first time he had ever come into contact with one\nof the raider's--profession. He didn't like it.\n\nExtending his free right hand, the farmer said, \"My name is Carroll.\nJoseph Carroll. You are--Mr. Gray?\"\n\nThe raider took the proffered hand warmly, trying to gain this man's\nfriendship. He would need all the help he could get.\n\n\"Gray is my given name, Mr. Carroll. My last name--\" he laughed\nembarrassedly, \"--well, they call me Wolf, for the time being.\"\n\n\"Appropriate,\" said the man bitterly.\n\n\"I'm sorry I have to meet you under these conditions, Mr. Carroll, very\nsorry.\"\n\nThe other shrugged, keeping his eyes fixed on the raider's lean, brown\nface, trying to guess what sort of mind lay behind it.\n\n\"In these times,\" he said finally, with an air of discouragement, \"one\ncannot choose either one's friends or the conditions of meeting.\"\n\nThe ferret-eyed man had been watching the exchange closely, and now\nhe sidled up to the raider with his thin, white hand extended. \"Please\nforgive Joseph,\" he said smoothly. \"He is not happy about this affair.\"\nHis voice exuded a sort of artificial charm, and Wolf found himself\nrepelled by the man.\n\n\"None of us do,\" he said. He turned to the farmer again, who was\nstanding uncomfortably, his eyes on the floor. Wolf watched him for a\nmoment, just long enough for the farmer to know he was being watched.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Wolf slowly, \"we had better straighten this out right\nnow.\"\n\nThe heavy-set man looked up defiantly. \"All right,\" he said. \"I admit\nI do not like this business, I do not like what you are here for, I do\nnot like what will happen to our village when you are gone.\"\n\nThe thin man laughed. \"The old man means to say he is a coward.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the man stubbornly, without taking his eyes away from Wolf.\n\"I am not a coward. But your mission means death for many people,\npeople I call my friends. I do not like that.\"\n\n\"There is a necessity,\" said Wolf, quietly.\n\n\"Perhaps, perhaps,\" said Joseph Carroll, shaking his head dubiously. \"I\ndo not pretend to understand the political complications. I know only\nthat, whether you succeed or fail, our village is lost. Our people will\nsuffer for what you do. Many will probably die. You cannot expect me to\nlike that.\"\n\n\"No,\" Wolf agreed. \"We do not expect that of you, Joseph. No one\nexpects you to like this. But, tell me--\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What was your tax the past year?\" Wolf asked.\n\nThe old man laughed bitterly. \"Seventy-nine percent.\"\n\n\"Enough to live on?\"\n\n\"Barely,\" said Carroll, leaning heavily on the scythe. \"It means we\nmust work many hours, sixteen or more a day, in order to survive.\"\n\n\"That is what we fight,\" said Wolf simply. \"That, and the near slavery\nof many of the Colonies. Do you know what happens to the money you pay\nthe Terran Federation in taxes?\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted Carroll. \"No one has dared ask.\"\n\nWolf laughed. \"And yet they say the Federation is a republic? When the\ncitizen does not dare ask what happens to the taxes that are ground out\nof him? I'll tell you, my friend Joseph. It is used for administration.\nSimply that. Administration of a space empire is an expensive project,\nand you must pay for it. It costs a great deal of money, our treasured\nEmpire. And what does the administration consist of? Machinery to\ncollect taxes. It is like a snake that feeds on its own tail, Joseph.\nTaxes are increased in order to have enough money to collect more\ntaxes. It never ends.\"\n\n\"This is one thing,\" said Joseph. \"The killing of people is another.\"\n\n\"How many do you know who have died in Debtor's camps, or died because\nthey could not work hard enough? Joseph, this is no life for a man. The\nColonies cannot develop under the Federation. They must be free to\ngovern themselves. Otherwise, we have simply a great, cancerous tumor,\nspreading through the universe, calling itself the Terran Federation.\"\n\nJoseph sighed. \"All right,\" he said. \"In principle I agree. The\ncolonies must be free. But is there no other way than murder and\nassassination? This violence--what can come of it? And if the\nrevolution succeeds eventually, how can we know the Federation will not\nbe replaced by the same thing under another name?\"\n\n\"Because you will govern yourselves,\" Wolf said. \"Every Colony will be\nautonomous, trading as a sovereign nation with the other Colonies. The\nidea of a Galactic Empire is self-defeating, Joseph, it is unhealthy,\nvicious. The only way man can go to the stars with his head up, is\nwithout dreams of infinite power blinding him.\"\n\n\"You are an idealist,\" said the ferret-eyed man, with surprise.\n\n\"A man must live for something,\" said Wolf, quietly.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" the thin man agreed quickly. \"I was surprised\nto find an idealist in your--trade.\"\n\n\"My trade is as distasteful to me as it is to you,\" said Wolf, speaking\nmore to Joseph Carroll than to the pale, thin man.\n\n\"What will the death of Mayne Landing accomplish?\" Carroll asked.\n\n\"Confusion. He is the Administrator of over one hundred planets. He\nis a strong man, a focal point. Without him, without his personal\nstrength, the administration of those planets will falter, and stop.\nIt isn't that he carries on the routine work, of course. But decisions\ncome from him, the decisions that cannot be made by routine, the\ndecisions that require a man's creative spark. Without that, the\nroutine itself cannot stand.\"\n\n\"It rather sounds as if you respect the man,\" said Carroll.\n\n\"Respect him? I--\" Wolf hesitated, uncertain. \"Yes,\" he finished. \"I\nrespect him. He is doing what he thinks is right, as I do what I think\nis right.\"\n\n\"And you would kill a man for whom you hold no hatred,\" Carroll\nmuttered. \"This thing is making beasts of us all.\"\n\n_If you only knew_, thought Wolf, _if you only knew._\n\n\"Sometimes it is necessary,\" he said aloud. \"Sometimes bad things are\nnecessary, that good may follow.\"\n\nCarroll sighed. \"Well, we are committed now. We must go ahead.\"\n\n\"I will need detailed information on Landing's plan of inspection,\"\nWolf said.\n\n\"You will have it,\" Carroll told him. \"Daimya has been in the city for\nfive days, listening and watching.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Wolf. He felt better now, getting into the operation. This\nhe knew, this he could handle. It was what he was trained for. It was\nthe other things that were bad, the thinking, the wondering, the long\nnights spent sleepless, uncertain.\n\n\"When will he be back?\" Wolf asked. \"This Daimya.\"\n\n\"She. Daimya is my daughter,\" Carroll said. \"Even our children must\nhave blood on their hands. She will return this evening.\"\n\n\n\nDaimya came, just after dark. Wolf was startled. He had expected a\nchild, from the way Carroll spoke, and Daimya was far from a child. She\nwas a slim woman, in her early twenties, he estimated. Her body was\nsleek and fit, and her long black hair was tied behind her head, where\nit flowed over her back like a waterfall carved from ebony. She had\nlarge eyes, slightly almond shaped, that regarded him solemnly as she\ngave the information she had gathered.\n\n\"He will come to inspect this village in two days,\" she said. \"He will\nvisit four farms, picked at random, and then there will be a procession\ndown the main street.\"\n\n\"That would be our time,\" Wolf mused. \"Crowds about.\"\n\n\"Some will be killed,\" Daimya objected. \"His guards will not take this\nthing lightly.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" Wolf said sincerely. \"It is our best chance of success.\"\n\nDaimya shrugged. \"You are the killer, not I,\" she said, with obvious\ndistaste.\n\nWolf felt an impulse to explain, to justify, to make this slight girl\nsee that he hated this. Angrily he fought it down.\n\n_It doesn't matter what she thinks_, he told himself. _It doesn't\nmatter. What matters is to get the job done and get out. That's all._\n\n\"Tell me,\" Daimya said curiously, \"how do you come to be mixed up in a\nthing like this? You don't act like a hired killer.\"\n\nWolf laughed shortly. \"No,\" he said. \"I'm an amateur. I was a Captain\nof the Security Patrol once. My whole family was in Federation Service,\nas a matter of fact. I was on Colony Patrol for three years. In that\ntime I saw so much suffering, so much injustice, so much simple cruelty\nthat--well, never mind. When I was contacted by a member of the\nrevolution underground, I deserted. It almost killed my father. Since I\nwas familiar with the Federation's higher echelons, I was assigned the\npleasant job of assassin.\"\n\n\"How many men have you killed in that job?\" Daimya asked, almost\ncasually.\n\nWolf watched her for a long moment before answering. \"You don't want to\nknow that,\" he said slowly.\n\nThe girl dropped her eyes. \"No. No, I guess you're right. I'm sorry.\"\n\nShe stood and went to the door. She stopped there and turned, looking\nat Wolf. He met her eyes and held them with his own, frankly, without\nembarrassment.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she repeated. She closed the door softly behind her, and\nWolf bent to study the map of the village she had provided.\n\n\n\nThe village lay in a cup-shaped valley. The main street was also\na direct highway out of Thanlar. On either side of the highway,\nthe farmer's fields stretched, checkered brown and green, to the\nfoothills. The entire valley was not more than a mile wide, and\nthe fields extended only a quarter of a mile on either side of the\nmain road. The foothills added another quarter of a mile, and then,\nabruptly, the mountains started.\n\nThough one of the principal highways to Thanlar, the main street was\nfairly narrow, bordered closely on either side by the small business\ndistrict, composed mostly of single story buildings constructed out of\nnative lumber from the hills.\n\nWolf decided the center of the business district would offer the most\nconcealment. Any group of men at any other place would be viewed with\nsuspicion by Mayne Landing's bodyguards, and their chances would be\nproportionately diminished.\n\nIt remained to determine the most effective weapon. Explosive? No,\ntoo many villagers would be killed. Yet that would certainly be the\nmost certain way, a grenade thrown from the roof of one of the low\nbuildings. He wondered how thoroughly the Administrator's men would\ncheck the village before the procession.\n\nJoseph Carroll told him the check was cursory; except for the spasmodic\nattacks of the revolution underground, the Colonies were submissive\nenough, and the precautions taken were in the nature of routine.\n\nIt looked to be easy, Wolf thought wryly. The easiest of them all,\nsince the planet was fairly distant from the scene of previous\nunderground operations.\n\nThey wouldn't be expecting it, he thought. Down the main street in\nprocession, the Administrator standing in the little ground car,\nsmiling and waving to his subjects, genial, effusive. And then--\n\n\"Joseph,\" said Wolf suddenly. \"How many men can I depend on?\"\n\n\"Perhaps thirty,\" said the farmer. \"Perhaps a few more.\"\n\n\"Are they completely dependable?\"\n\n\"Within reason,\" said Carroll. \"They are farmers, not soldiers. Plows\nare more familiar to them than guns.\"\n\n\"How many can you get me that will obey me without question, no matter\nwhat?\"\n\nJoseph Carroll tugged absently at his ear. Finally, he shrugged.\n\"Perhaps five,\" he said. \"Including myself.\"\n\n\"All right,\" sighed Wolf. \"It will have to be that way, then. But the\nothers can be depended on 'within reason?'\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Carroll said. \"Do not expect too much. They do not like this\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Neither do you,\" Wolf said. \"But you count yourself among the five\ntrustworthy.\"\n\nCarroll didn't answer, and Wolf took his silence as a declaration of\nfaith.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Leave me now. At sunset, bring your men to me,\nall of them. I will work out the attack.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Carroll, and started to leave.\n\n\"Joseph,\" said Wolf softly, and the older man turned at the door.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"What about Daimya?\"\n\n\"What about her?\"\n\n\"Where will she be during--this attack?\"\n\n\"At home, I expect,\" said Carroll. \"Where she belongs.\"\n\nWolf toyed for a moment with the map that lay before him.\n\n\"Joseph,\" he said. \"What _will_ happen to the village?\"\n\n\"You don't know?\" asked Carroll in surprise.\n\n\"No,\" Wolf admitted. \"I have never stayed behind.\"\n\nCarroll laughed bitterly. \"One of two things,\" he said. \"They will\neither demolish it from the air, including the populace, or they will\nput everyone in one of the forced labor camps.\" The farmer made a small\ngesture of resignation.\n\n\"I didn't know,\" Wolf said, almost under his breath. _Can I be\nresponsible for that?_\n\n\"They don't like Colonists cooperating with the revolutionaries,\"\nCarroll continued. \"Did you expect they exempted us all from our taxes\nas a reward?\"\n\n\"No,\" Wolf said. \"But I didn't know it was so--complete.\"\n\n\"They are thorough,\" the old man shrugged. \"Any village where an\nincident occurs is made an example. Before long, you people will not\nfind much welcome in the Colonies.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" Wolf mused. \"Perhaps by then--\"\n\n\"You really believe you're going to succeed in overthrowing the\nFederation, don't you?\"\n\n\"I must,\" said Wolf. \"Without that, all this--\" he gestured to the map\nbefore him, traced with arrows, notations, ideas, \"--is meaningless\nslaughter.\"\n\n\"So it seems,\" Carroll said flatly.\n\n\"Joseph,\" said Wolf suddenly. \"With luck, there will be a ship waiting\nfor me in the mountains when I've--finished here.\"\n\n\"That's your good fortune,\" Carroll said grimly.\n\n\"Will you come with me?\"\n\n\"And join the revolutionaries?\"\n\n\"You--and Daimya.\"\n\nCarroll considered it slowly. \"No,\" he said finally. \"Not I. I have\ngotten my people into this, I must stay with them. All were against it\nwhen you first contacted us. All but me. It is my fault. I have to stay\nwith them.\"\n\nWolf felt a sudden surge of affection for the old man. Reluctant he\nmight be, but he knew what he was doing and he knew the consequences\nand was willing to accept them.\n\n\"And Daimya?\"\n\n\"That is a different matter,\" said Carroll. \"It is not right that she\nshould suffer for her father's folly.\"\n\n_Or that a father should suffer for his son's folly_, thought Wolf. But\nhe said nothing.\n\n\"You would take her?\" Carroll asked.\n\n\"If I am--able,\" said Wolf.\n\n\"All right,\" said the old man. \"I will see to it. Better she should be\nalive than dead. That is all that matters.\"\n\n\n\nWolfs final plan was simple. He had not enough men to count on a direct\nattack. The major work would be performed by the dependable five,\nof which Carroll assured him. The others would be used to create a\ndiversion to cover the actual assault.\n\nThere was a slight bend to the highway just before it entered the\nvillage. When the procession passed this point, they would see a\ngroup of men disperse quickly into the low scrub at the side of the\nroad. This would put them on their guard, they would be apprehensive,\nwatching.\n\nWhen the procession had entered the village itself and was within the\nshort commercial strip, there would be an explosion back of them.\nGrenades, perhaps some shooting. If Wolf's prediction were accurate,\nthis would divert the attention of at least the major portion of guards\nfor long enough.\n\nLong enough for the five men in the crowd to do what they had to do--\n\n\"This must be timed perfectly,\" he told the man who was to head the\ndiversionary squad.\n\n\"I understand that.\"\n\n\"Too soon or too late, either will destroy us. It will take us too long\nto reach the Administrator. He must be exactly opposite the tailor's\nshop. It must be done right.\"\n\n\"It will be done right.\"\n\n\"If it is not, all the sacrifices are for nothing, you understand that?\nThe consequences will be as bad, or worse, for the village, and we will\nhave accomplished nothing. If the Administrator is dead, there will\nbe time for most of the villagers to escape into the hills before the\nFederation can take action against them.\"\n\nThe man left, after Wolf had provided him with the weapons his group\nwould need from his cache on the nearby hillside.\n\nThe dependable five were instructed in their parts, and then there was\nnothing to do but wait.\n\nThe next morning dawned clear. The air was cool, a slight breeze\nruffled the fields around the village. As the sun rose higher in the\nsky, it glinted sharply from the towers of Thanlar.\n\nIt had been impossible to keep the entire operation a secret from\nthe villagers. They knew something was to happen, and they knew it\nconcerned the inspection trip of Mayne Landing to the village. It was\nnot hard to guess what it was.\n\nAs the day drew on toward noon, the tension of the people grew. Small\nknots of farmers gathered on the corners, their fields forgotten for\nthe day, talking low.\n\nWolf didn't like it, it was too obvious. The village was primed, ready\nto explode, and he was afraid the tension would make the guards _too_\nalert. They had to be just tense enough to respond to the diversion,\nnot enough so they would be watching _everywhere_. He was counting on\nan instinctive, rapid response.\n\nHe sat behind the tailor shop, talking to his men with a confidence and\ncalm he did not feel. He spoke as if the success of the mission were a\nforegone fact, and the escape of the villagers into the hills. But he\nknew it was tenuous.\n\nPerhaps he had planned it too critically. Perhaps a simple direct\nattack would have been better. Perhaps, perhaps--\n\nAny number of things were possible, he thought. But it was done now. If\nhe had made a mistake, they would know soon.\n\nOn the contraband comset behind the tailor shop, Wolf had called the\nmother-ship that hovered just out of detection range. All right, they\nconfirmed, there would be a shuttle in the hills back of the town. Did\nhe know the shuttle that had brought him had been lost? No? Well, it\nhad. With the whole crew aboard.\n\n_That many more_, thought Wolf. _If anybody's keeping a list, I've got\na lot to my credit. Or damnation._ And, bitterly: _More friends than\nenemies._\n\nDon't think about it. Do your job and get the hell out. If you can.\n\nHe spoke to Daimya, but on her father's advice did not tell her of his\nplan to take her along.\n\n\"She won't go voluntarily,\" the old man said frankly. \"We will have to\npretend we are all going to the hills. After that--\" he nodded slowly,\n\"--the problem is yours.\"\n\n\"I will take care of her, Joseph,\" Wolf had promised, and the\nsun-browned farmer had clasped his hand tightly in a mute gesture of\nhopefulness.\n\n\"You understand--a man and his daughter--you understand?\"\n\n_More than you probably know, Joseph._\n\n\"Yes,\" he said aloud. \"I think I understand.\"\n\nAnd then came the word that the Administrator's procession was in\nsight.\n\nWolf looked at his five dependables. He passed each face slowly,\nas if he had never seen them before. They were young, and old, and\nmiddle-aged. They were dark from the hours in the sun, strong from the\nwork that pulled their muscles for the long hours each day. They smiled\nat him, grimly, nervous, but they were good men.\n\n_The faces of freedom_, Wolf thought. _These are the faces and the\nbodies of freedom._\n\nThen it was time.\n\n\n\nThe streets were lined with silent people when the procession came into\nview around the slight curve.\n\nThen there was a tentative cheer from someone. It was taken up by\nsomeone else, and soon the crowd was roaring its synthetic appreciation\nof Administrator Mayne Landing. Wolf breathed easier.\n\nCraning his neck in the crowd, Wolf spotted the other five, standing\ndispersed in the crowd, but all near the spot on the street opposite\nthe tailor's shop. They made no acknowledgement except meeting his\neyes, then turning away to watch the procession near.\n\nAs they came closer, Wolf noted with satisfaction that several of the\nguards occasionally glanced at the street behind them.\n\nGood. They had seen the knot of men outside town, then. If they\nexpected anything, they were expecting it from behind them.\n\nHe could see the tall, straight figure of Mayne Landing in the ground\ncar. He took in the familiar face almost hungrily, the great shock\nof white hair moving gently in the slight breeze, the characteristic\ngesture, a half-salute, the slight smile, the kindly eyes of the old\nman--\n\nHe tore his eyes away from the dignified figure and glanced behind him,\ndown the street. He saw a figure move on a roof-top, and wondered if\nthe guards saw it, too.\n\nThen the ground car was opposite, and Wolf had a wrenching sensation\nthat the diversionary squad was not going to go through with it....\n\nAn explosion rocked the street a block away, shaking the ground\nunderfoot, shattering windows in the adjacent stores. A billow of dirty\nblack smoke began to drift toward the sky. There was a scattering of\nsmall, explosive fire.\n\nThe tone of the crowd's roar changed. It deepened and became a mass cry\nof confusion and fright.\n\nQuietly, Wolf edged forward to the street, automatically noting that\nhis men were doing the same. Several of the guards had turned, were\nrunning back toward the source of the excitement, and others were\nturned toward it. But those around Mayne Landing had not responded.\nThey were keeping their eyes fixed on the crowd. They were too well\ntrained to be drawn off, and Wolf cursed under his breath.\n\nHe stopped his forward motion and waited, rocking on the balls of his\nfeet. This was the part he hadn't told his five about.\n\nSuddenly there was a flurry in the crowd on the opposite side of\nthe street. The nearest guard whirled, in time to draw his hand gun\nand fire. The first of the five sprawled in the street, a bloody\nstump where his head had been. But the guard's blast had not been in\ntime to stop the long mowing knife that buried itself to the hilt in\nhis throat. He lurched forward, dropping the hand gun. His momentum\ncarried him almost into the edge of the crowd, and a woman screamed\nhysterically.\n\nWolf's other men had been only a fraction of a second behind the first,\nand the street was now a chaos of shouting and the sharp, flat reports\nof the guards' hand guns. The crowd milled frantically, adding to the\nconfusion as the attackers leaped at the procession.\n\nWolf waited, waited, watching for the single split-second when the\nguards were fully engaged with the crowd.\n\nThen it came, and their heads were momentarily turned away from Mayne\nLanding.\n\nWolf sprinted from the crowd, the short stiletto cradled in his hand.\nHe leaped to the side of the ground car just as Mayne Landing turned\ntoward him.\n\nHe saw the old man's face clearly in that moment. It held no fear, but\nonly an unbelievable surprise, an astonishment beyond understanding.\nThen the stiletto slid gently into the throat, severing the jugular,\nand all surprise and emotion was lost in the implacable blank agony\nof death. The still-pumping heart forced a pulsing stream of bright\narterial blood around the blade of the knife.\n\nThen, as quickly as he had come, Wolf was gone. He slipped back\nthrough the crowd, into the door of the tailor shop. Seconds later,\nJoseph Carroll was there, one side of his gray farmer's tunic turning\nbrown-black from the blood that soaked it.\n\n\"Come on!\" Carroll snapped, running for the back.\n\n\"What about the others?\"\n\n\"Gone,\" said the old man shortly. \"All of them.\" He dashed out the door\nof the tailor shop into the back and Wolf followed him.\n\n\"Daimya!\" Wolf shouted.\n\n\"She's waiting for us in the foothills.\"\n\nThe sound of the crowd and the blasting of hand guns was loud behind\nthem as they began their dash across the checkered fields. For a few\nmoments, nothing followed. Then Wolf heard a faint shout behind them,\nand a huge gout of dirt erupted from the field beside him, almost\nknocking him down.\n\nHe regained his balance and started to run low, crouched and\nzig-zagging while the tiny explosive pellets pocked the field around\nhim. It seemed an eternity before they had crossed the field, but he\nknew it was not more than a couple of minutes.\n\nJoseph Carroll was ahead of him, already beginning to tear through the\nscrub growth of the foothills, making his way up. Just as he entered\nthe undergrowth, Wolf saw the old man joined by a smaller, slighter\nfigure.\n\nThere was a roar in his ears, and he fell, a searing pain across his\nback. Numbly, he realized he'd been hit, but somehow it didn't seem\nimportant. He picked himself up and followed Carroll into the scrub.\nSoon he was out of sight of their pursuers, though the explosions of\ntheir weapons still followed them with uncanny accuracy.\n\nHe caught up with the old man and his daughter in a small clearing.\nCarroll lay with his head cradled in Daimya's lap, gasping for breath.\n\n\"We've got to go on,\" Wolf said. \"Come on, I'll help.\"\n\n\"You're hurt!\" the girl said.\n\n\"Not badly. Come on, we've got to get your father out of here!\"\n\nThe old man put his arms around the shoulders of the other two, and\nthey struggled up the hill, breaking their way through the brush,\nslipping, sometimes falling. Behind them, there was still the\noccasional sound of the explosive pellets, and infrequently, one came\nvery near.\n\n\"Close,\" muttered Wolf as an explosion showered them with dirt.\n\"They're on the path now.\"\n\nThey went a few steps farther, and Joseph slumped between them.\n\n\"Dad!\" called Daimya. \"Please! Please try to go on!\"\n\nWolfs hand slid down the old man's back, came away warm and wet.\n\nHe was silent for a moment, then gently lowered the suddenly limp body\nto the ground.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said to Daimya. The girl was standing over the inert\nform of her father, not understanding what had happened, words of\nencouragement still on her lips.\n\n\"Dad?\" she said, bewildered.\n\nWolf took her arm. \"Daimya, he's gone. Come on.\"\n\n\"No--Dad--\" She knelt beside him on the ground.\n\n\"Sorry, Daimya,\" Wolf said under his breath. He swung, hitting her\ncleanly behind the head. The girl collapsed soundlessly, and he slung\nher over his shoulder and started on up the hill.\n\nFinally, he cleared the crest. Just beyond it, lying in a tiny meadow\nlay the black, unmarked shuttle ship. As he came in view, the port\nopened and a man ran toward him. Wolf stumbled, caught his balance,\nwent on.\n\n\"Here,\" said the crewman, \"let me take her.\"\n\nSilently, out of fatigue, Wolf relinquished his load and stumbled\ntoward the port. It slid shut behind them, just in time to keep them\nfrom being covered with dirt blown from a hole that suddenly appeared a\nyard behind. Wolf caught a glimpse of men appearing at the crest.\n\nInside the ship, he could hear the thud and clang of the explosive\ncartridges detonating uselessly against the permalloy hull. Then the\ndrives roared their song of power, and the shuttle lifted clear.\n\n\n\nThe crewmen were more than curious.\n\n\"Who the hell's the girl?\"\n\n\"Got me. Never heard of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose a Raider has a right to pick up a little booty now and\nthen,\" another laughed. \"They don't have the easiest job in the world.\"\n\n\"Bet she's going to be mad when she wakes up.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Looks like the Raider might be worrying a little about that\nright now.\"\n\nWolf stood at the forward screen, silently watching the shape of the\nmother-ship grow larger and larger until the screen held nothing but\nthe great black hull.\n\nThe crewmen were wrong, he wasn't worried about Daimya's waking. He\ncould take care of that when the time came.\n\nHe was thinking about other things, the things that came to him when he\nslept, the faces, the names, the actions, the right and wrong of living\naccording to what you think is right, no matter what the cost.\n\nBut the cost, the cost....\n\nIt was so high sometimes, so terribly high.\n\n_This trip_, he thought. A shuttle crew. Five good men, probably the\nwhole village, eventually. Those who did escape into the hills would\nlead a life of fear and pursuit, foraging as they went until finally\nthey were caught. And worst of all, this was worst of all, and mentally\nhe saw the list, the list of his responsibilities, the list for which\nhe would someday have to account.\n\nThe bright name of Mayne Landing: victim.\n\nHis mind shied away from it.\n\n_Can that be forgiven? Can such a thing ever be forgiven?_\n\nGray Landing, called Wolf in the underground, turned away from the\nforward screen and began to prepare to board the mother-ship.\n\n\n\n\n",
