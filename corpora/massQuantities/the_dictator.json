    "body": "Just looking at Ellaby, you could tell he was going places. He was\nfive feet nine inches tall and weighed a hundred and fifty pounds. He\nhad an I. Q. of ninety-eight point five-seven, less than four\nhundredths off the mode. His hair was mousey and worn slightly long\nfor a man, slightly short for a woman. Back in High Falls, where he\nwas born, he was physically weaker than sixty percent of the men but\nstronger than sixty percent of the women.\n\nHe had been in training since his twentieth birthday to assassinate\nthe Dictator. Ellaby was now thirty years old.\n\nDorcas Sinclair met Ellaby at the pneumo-station. She was too big and\nstrapping for a woman, but otherwise not unattractive with her\nlusterless hair, slightly thick-featured face, small sagging bosom and\nheavy-calved legs.\n\n\"I'll take your bags,\" she told Ellaby, and led him from the station.\nShe walked quickly, but not too quickly. You always had to find the\nhappy medium, thought Ellaby. For Ellaby, finding the happy medium had\nalways come easy. Ten years ago, when Ellaby had been graduated from\nthe High Falls secondary school, the four words MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED\nhad been printed under his picture in the yearbook. It was expected by\neveryone: young Ellaby had learned his three R's--rules, rights,\nresponsibilities--satisfactorily. Ellaby had neither excelled nor\nfailed: he was by nature a first class citizen.\n\nRunning to keep up with the too big, too long-legged Dorcas Sinclair\nwho was carrying one of his suitcases in each hand, Ellaby was led\nfrom the pneumo-station. The splendid, unimaginative geometric\nprecision of the Capitol stretched out before him in the dazzling\nsummer sunlight, the view serving as a leaven for Ellaby's usually\nphlegmatic disposition. He could feel his spirits rise, his heart\nthump more rapidly, speeding the sudden flow of adrenalin through his\nbody.\n\nThis was the city. It was here where the fruits of whatever had gone\nwrong in Ellaby's upbringing or whatever had gone wrong in the linear\narrangement of his genes would ripen. It was here where Ellaby, modal\nEllaby would pass his tests for top-secret work; unsuspected, average\nEllaby, would write his name in flaming letters across the pages of\nhistory. It was here where Ellaby would kill the Dictator.\n\nAnd after that--what? Chaos? A new order based not on modality but\nsomething else? Ellaby wasn't sure. No one in the organization knew\nfor sure. The concept was staggering to Ellaby. It was the system--or\nnothing. Well, let the others worry about it. They did the planning.\nEllaby was only the executioner.\n\n\n\nThe house was like all the others on the block, all the others in the\nCapitol, a grimly solid structure of lets-pretend brick fronting on a\nstreet which faded into distant haze, straight as a ruled line, to\nnorth and south, crossing the east-west avenues at precise right\nangles every five hundred feet. The grid pattern city, Ellaby\nremembered from his rights course in school, (every man has the right\nto a room and bath in any city as long as he is employed) made the\nbest use of available space for houses. The strip city is unnecessary\nin time of peace--was there ever, had there ever been any other time?\nthe radial city is preferred for rapid transportation, being the\naccepted pattern in the great economic hubs and ports like Greater New\nYork and Hampton Roads.\n\n\"You will have to live here with me\" Dorcas Sinclair told Ellaby,\n\"until you pass your tests for employment. I don't have to tell you\nhow much depends on the outcome of those tests, Ellaby.\"\n\n\"But I can't fail them. I thought you knew my record.\"\n\nWith an unnerving unmodal violence, Dorcas Sinclair's strong fingers\ndug into the flabby muscle of Ellaby's upper arm. \"Well, you had\nbetter not,\" she said, her large teeth hardly parting to let the\nsounds out.\n\nEllaby was suddenly alarmed. He had had very little truck with people\nof this sort. They were as unpredictable as the weather in High Falls\nwhich having a population under twenty-five thousand, had never\nqualified for weather control. Unlike modal man, they had never been\nexhaustively studied. Their likes and dislikes were not catered to,\nbut their passions couldn't be predicted, either.\n\n\"Ease up, Dorcas,\" a deep voice said from the doorway leading to the\nkitchen.\n\nEllaby stared in that direction gratefully. It was indecent for a\nwoman, for anyone, to expose her emotions that way. Ellaby was almost\ninclined to thank the stranger.\n\n\"Stranger, nothing!\" Ellaby blurted aloud. Ellaby's face reddened and\nhe apologized. \"I didn't mean to raise my voice,\" he explained. \"You\nsurprised me.\"\n\n\"I guess you didn't expect to find me here, at that. You haven't\nchanged much, Ellaby.\"\n\nAutomatically, Ellaby mumbled his thanks for the compliment. Sam\nMulden, though, had changed. He'd always been a radical. He wore his\nhair cropped too short. He was tall and thin, his elbows and knees\nexposed by the tunic he wore like knots on gnarled, living wood.\nMulden looked older. He hadn't bothered to dye his graying hair, or\nto smooth the premature wrinkles on his long-nosed, thin-lipped face.\nHe was smiling sardonically at Ellaby now, as if he could read\nEllaby's mind. \"I might have known it would be you,\" he said. \"As soon\nas they said the assassin was coming from High Falls, I should have\nguessed.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Ellaby. It was a question which had nudged for ten years\nat his docile patience. When people go out of their way to train you,\nthough, to spend ten years teaching you every inch of Capitol\nterritory without once taking you there, to make you proficient with\nvarious deadly weapons although your reflexes are splendidly modal, to\nteach you meaningless phrases like democratic inequality (?) and\nindividuality (?) and the right to live a self-directed (?) life, to\nmake your own decisions (?), when people act, in short, like a very\nthorough government school, even if their motives seem strangely\nmisdirected, you don't question them.\n\n\"For two reasons,\" Mulden said. \"You can understand the first, Ellaby.\nIf the second one bothers you, forget it. In the first place, you're\nso perfectly modal, the government would never suspect you. In the\nsecond place, you're so well adjusted you're bound to follow our\ninstructions.\"\n\n\"Or any instructions,\" Dorcas Sinclair said. \"That's what I'm afraid\nof, Mulden.\"\n\n\n\nEllaby still couldn't get over it. He never expected to find poor,\nunfortunate Sam Mulden in such a high position in the organization or\nanywhere. He remembered Mulden clearly from their school days\ntogether. Mulden was a character, a real character. Physically, he was\nbarely acceptable: more than eighty percent of the men and some\nsixty-five percent of the women were able to knock Mulden down in the\nHigh Falls gymnasium classes. But mentally Mulden was a misfit. His I.\nQ. was in the neighborhood of a hundred and fifty. His gangling,\nineffectual physique wasn't too far below the mode, but mentally he\nsoared intolerably above it.\n\nNow Mulden told Dorcas Sinclair, \"Don't worry about that. We've had\nten years to work on him. They can't undo it in a few days. Ellaby,\nyou are quite sure you know what you must do?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Tomorrow morning I will take my security tests. According to\nthe record of my previous physical and mental testing, I should make\ntop secret classification. I will work here in the capitol. I will\nfind the Dictator and kill him. The only thing that bothers me is I\ndon't know who to look for. What does the Dictator look like?\"\n\n\"Didn't they explain all of that to you in High Falls?\" the woman\nasked irritably, without even making an effort to poker her face.\n\n\"Ease off,\" Mulden told her for the second time. \"He's confused.\nListen to me, Ellaby. Don't you remember? The Dictator never makes\npublic appearances.\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, now I remember. No one knows what the Dictator looks like.\nHe keeps to himself. He issues orders which are instantly obeyed,\nhelping to maintain universal modality in the country. It almost seems\na shame I'll have to kill him.\"\n\n\"So we've pavloved him for ten years, have we?\" Dorcas Sinclair raged.\nEllaby turned away in embarrassment. \"Damn you, Mulden, he still\nquestions it!\"\n\n\"He's supposed to,\" Mulden explained quietly. \"If he accepted what we\ntold him, he'd go around talking about it naively. This way, he\nunderstands the necessity for secrecy.\"\n\n\"He doesn't understand--\"\n\n\"Well, then he realizes it. Let him get some sleep, will you?\nTomorrow's going to be a good day for us, a big day for him. Good\nnight, Ellaby. If you want anything, Sinclair will get it for you.\"\n\nEllaby assured them he would want nothing except a simple meal of\nwhatever most people in the Capitol ate on Wednesdays. It turned out\nto be pork chops, which Ellaby neither particularly liked nor\ndisliked. He chewed his food with the proper lack of enthusiasm and\nretired early.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, Ellaby took his I. Q. test at the Capitol personnel\nbureau. He was slightly above average in space perception but slightly\nbelow average in comparisons. He hoped his anxiety didn't show on his\nface. If anyone asked him why he had come to the Capitol he was ready\nto blurt out the reason and have done with it. He wondered what Sam\nMulden would have thought if he knew. The Sinclair woman would have\nbeen furious.\n\nNo one asked Ellaby. You came to the Capitol because you wanted to\nwork there. According to the mode, a man desired to change his\nlocation every 3.7 years. Ellaby had been 6.3 years tardy, but High\nFalls was an ideally modal community in which people tended to linger.\n\n\"I. Q., point seven under the mode,\" the personnel clerk told Ellaby.\nThe slight variation--due to his anxiety--was not enough to matter,\nEllaby realized with a faint sense of triumph. \"Proceed to physical\ntesting,\" the girl told Ellaby.\n\nObediently, Ellaby followed the green arrow to the gymnasium. He was\ngiven a locker, a towel, a pair of athletic shorts and a first-aid\nkit. He stripped off his clothing, placing the tunic, underwear and\nsandals in the locker, then climbed into his athletic shorts and fell\ninto line with the other men and women carrying their towels and\nfirst-aid kits into the gymnasium.\n\nThe ten-over-mode male wrestling tester pinned Ellaby in less than two\nminutes, a fact which was duly noted on his employment blank. He was\ngiven fifteen minutes of rest, then squared off on the mat with a\nskinny, five-under-mode male. Ellaby bested him in four minutes flat,\ntook another fifteen minute break, mopping the sweat from his body\nwith an already sodden towel, then defeated the ten-under-mode female\nwrestler in two minutes and some seconds. It developed into a knock\ndown, drag out fight with the two-over-mode female, who finally forced\nEllaby's shoulders to the mat for the necessary five seconds after\nhalf an hour.\n\nEllaby showered, ate a hot Thursday lunch and took his employment\nblank to the emotion lab. His electroencephalogram revealed nine alpha\ncycles to the second, but too much theta.\n\n\"Are you nervous?\" the technician asked Ellaby. \"You're thetaing all\nover the place.\"\n\n\"I guess so. Yes, I'm nervous.\"\n\n\"Then let's try it again.\"\n\nThey did, the technician rubbing the greasy electrode salve on\nEllaby's forehead before the electrodes were fastened there for the\nsecond time. The result was the same. \"More than modal theta,\" said\nthe technician, writing something in code on his employment blank.\n\"See the personnel advisor, please.\"\n\nFor Ellaby, it came as a distinct shock. His heart pounded against his\ntemples, in his ears. He was emotionally unstable. Had the ten years\nbeen for nothing?\n\n\n\n\"Sit down, Ellaby,\" the personnel advisor said. He was a man of middle\nage, irritatingly careless about his appearance. He had dyed his\ngraying hair, of course, but if you looked close you could see gray at\nthe roots. He wore a green Thursday tunic which was poorly starched.\nHaving had a full week to get it ready, that was naturally\ninexcusable.\n\n\"You have a splendid record, Ellaby,\" the sloppy personnel clerk said.\n\"Mentally, within tenths of the mode. Physically, even closer.\nUnfortunately your emotional--\"\n\n\"That never happened to me before, not in High Falls, it didn't,\"\nEllaby interrupted.\n\n\"This is not High Falls. Every community, you must realize, has its\nown security testing center. And the capitol requires the tightest\nsecurity of all.\"\n\n\"I know but I was nervous. You're going to tell me my theta was too\nhigh, aren't you?\"\n\n\"That's correct. You needn't feel so bad about it. You're going to be\ncleared for secret work. You're damn close to modal, Ellaby. You're a\ngood security risk. Incidentally, just why were you nervous?\"\n\n\"Because I wanted top secret clearance. Because I wanted to work close\nto the Dictator. You see--\" Abruptly, Ellaby stopped talking, clasping\na hand over his mouth in sudden confusion. He wasn't supposed to talk\nabout this. Lying, of course, was as far from Ellaby's nature as it\nwas from anyone else's, assuming he were reasonably close to the mode.\nBut Ellaby hadn't been asked for all that information directly. \"What\nkind of job will I get?\" he asked, trying desperately to change the\nsubject.\n\nIt was too late. The personnel clerk asked, \"Just why did you want to\nwork close to the Dictator?\"\n\nEllaby felt a single drop of sweat fall from his armpit under the\nloose tunic and roll, itching, down the side of his body. He wanted\nwith all his soul to be back in High Falls. Anyplace but here.\n\n\"Why, Ellaby?\"\n\n\"I can't answer that question. A man isn't forced to answer a question\nunless he wants to.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said the personnel advisor, staring blandly at\nEllaby. \"This is a democratic country.\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\n\"But you've never known a man to refuse answering a question asked of\nhim officially, have you?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I understand, sir.\"\n\n\"You don't have to be so obsequious, Ellaby. I'm less modal than you\nare, but I make the best of my divergencies. What I meant was this:\ndid you ever hear of a criminal _not_ confessing to his crime?\"\n\n\"Well, no.\"\n\n\"I'll ask you the question again, Ellaby. Why did you want to work\nnear the Dictator?\"\n\nThe man leaned close, peered at Ellaby. The room was small, almost a\ncubicle, the bare walls seeming to close in on all four sides. Ellaby\nstifled a wild impulse to scream and run out of there, run any place\nas long as he could leave the room and the personnel advisor behind\nhim. \"I'm sorry, but I can't answer that question,\" he said finally.\n\n\"Tell me, Ellaby, did you ever hear your own voice?\"\n\nWhat a strange question. \"Why, certainly. All the time, when I speak.\"\n\n\"No, I mean your voice reproduced artificially. Your radio voice?\"\n\n\"No, I never heard it.\"\n\n\"Well, you're about to.\"\n\nWhile the personnel advisor busied himself setting up the radio\nequipment, Ellaby had a few seconds in which to think. He could still\nmake a clean breast of the whole thing. They had chosen him--Mulden,\nthe Sinclair woman and the others in High Falls--for his modality.\nVery well, he could use that modality to get out from under. He didn't\nunderstand. He didn't know what they were leading him to, slowly, over\na period of ten years. _He_ didn't want to assassinate the Dictator.\nWhat in the world would he want to do that for? He would gladly name\nall the names he knew if the personnel advisor would only let him\nforget the whole mad experience and return to High Falls. He could\nattend Adjustment Academy if they thought he needed it. Anything.\nAnything....\n\n\"Please slip these earphones over your head, over your ears. There. Is\nthe microphone close enough to your lips? I think so.\"\n\n\n\nA metal band running over the top of Ellaby's cranium held the\nearphones in place. Another metal band curved around the side of his\ncheek and chin, leading to a small microphone before his lips.\n\n\"Place your hands on the arms of your chair, please.\"\n\nEllaby did as he was told. _Click! Click!_ A pair of manacles sprang\nup from the chair arms trapping Ellaby's wrists. Ellaby looked at the\npersonnel tester in unpokered alarm. \"What did you do that for?\" he\nasked timidly.\n\n\"So you won't remove the earphones. Now, are we ready?\" The personnel\nadvisor pressed a button on his desk. Ellaby thought he heard a faint\nhum of power in the microphone. \"I will ask you once more, Ellaby. Why\ndid you want to work near the Dictator?\"\n\nEllaby shrugged. He was going to say, \"I'm sorry, but I don't have to\nanswer that question.\" He said, and heard through the earphones: \"I'm\nsorry (I'm) but I (sorry don't have (but) to ans (I) wer that (don't)\nquestion) (have to answer that question).\"\n\n\"Again, please. I didn't hear you,\" the personnel tester said.\n\nIt was his own voice Ellaby had heard through the earphones. Playback,\nwith a fraction of a second lapse. Oddly, it un-nerved him. The\nreproduced voice had no right lagging. He shouted, \"I'm sorry (I'm)\nbut I (sorry) don't have (but) to ans (I) wer that (don't question!)\n(have to) Shut up! (answer) SHUT UP! (that) PLEASE.... (question).\nPLEASE! (please).\"\n\n\"Once more, if you don't mind.\"\n\nEllaby's head was whirling. He blinked sweat from his eyes.\n\"I--please! (I--please!)\"\n\n\"The law requires that you make some answer, even if answer is a\nrefusal.\"\n\nCriminals confessed, Ellaby thought wildly. Is this why criminals\nconfessed? Did the sound of their own voices drive them mad? It seemed\nsuch a simple device, and yet ... and yet ... but he could fool it. He\ncouldn't rush the words out in a quick torrent and: \"I don't have to\n(I don't answer that ques) (have to) tion (answer that question.)\"\nEllaby--and Ellaby's echo. \"Well, I (well) don't (I don't)!\" Ellaby\nblinked more sweat from his eyes. \"Mumble (mumble). Sob. (Sob).\"\n\n\"Relax, Ellaby. You seem upset. Will you read this, please?\" the\npersonnel advisor held a card in front of Ellaby's face.\n\nThe words swam, blurred together, fused, were readable and then were\nnot. Ellaby read aloud: \"A code (a) of eth (code) ics for (eth)\nmankind (ethics for mankind).\" It was, he realized, the preamble to\nthe constitution. \"In the (in) nineteenth (the) centur (nine) y the\n(nine) common (teenth)\"--faster, faster!--\"(century the common)\nc-common man was defended (common man) by enlightened liberalism (man\nwas). In the t-twentieth century (in the t-twen) common man was\nchampioned by (tieth century) enlightened liberalism (the common man\nwas). In the twenty-first century (championed by enlightened) the\ncommon man assumed his proper place (liberalism) at the top of society\nbut (in the twenty-first cen) will protect the rights of the (tury the\ncommon man) enlightened liberals or any other minority, (assumed his\nproper) encouraging them to become (place at the top of) as common as\npossible (society but will protect the rights of the enlightened\nliberals or any other minority, encouraging them to become as common\nas possible).\n\n\"Oh God (Oh),\" shouted Ellaby. \"Shut (God) it (shut) off (it) make\n(off) it (make) stop (it) God (stop--God)!\"\n\n\"Will you agree to answer my question?\"\n\n\"Anything (anything)! ANYTHING (anything).\" Now the playback was a\nfaint whisper. Ellaby found himself hysterically fascinated by it,\ntrying to guess the time-lapse, which varied, trying to guess the\nvolume, which varied. Ellaby's head slumped forward on his chest. The\nunfamiliar wetness at the corners of his mouth was drool. Ellaby\ndidn't quite know it, of course, but he had given himself a very mild\nand very temporary nervous breakdown.\n\nTwo hours later he was asked one question. He answered: \"I want to be\nnear the Dictator so I can kill him.\"\n\n\n\nLater, Dorcas Sinclair asked: \"What else happened at testing, Ellaby?\"\n\n\"Take your time,\" Mulden cautioned. \"He looks nervous.\"\n\n\"I know it. I want to find out why.\"\n\n\"After my EEG,\" said Ellaby softly, \"they told me I had too much\ntheta.\"\n\n\"Damn you!\" Dorcas Sinclair swore. \"Then you weren't cleared for top\nsecret?\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't. Not at first. Then a strange thing happened. They said\nI was cleared only for secret and asked me why I wanted to be cleared\nfor top secret.\"\n\n\"You fool!\" the woman cried.\n\n\"I told them it was because I wanted to work near the Dictator. I\ndidn't mean to tell them, but--\"\n\nThe woman shook her head in despair. \"Don't bother finishing,\" she\nsaid. \"You can clear out of here, Ellaby. You're through. Ten years.\nTen years wasted.\"\n\n\"If you wish,\" Ellaby said mildly. \"But you're missing the most\ninteresting part. They asked me why I wanted to be near the Dictator.\"\n\nDorcas Sinclair sucked in her breath sharply. Even Mulden seemed\nanxious. \"You didn't tell them?\" the woman asked in a frantic whisper.\n\n\"I'm afraid I did.\"\n\n\"We'll have to flee the city,\" the woman told Mulden, ignoring Ellaby\nnow. \"If he told them that, he probably named names. I have friends in\nHampton Roads--\"\n\n\"Let him finish,\" Mulden said. Mulden was looking strangely at Ellaby.\n\n\"They didn't ask me to name anyone in the conspiracy,\" Ellaby said.\n\"Unless they could poker very well, they seemed perfectly calm. They\nsaid they would make an exception in my case. They would clear me for\ntop secret work. I start tomorrow.\"\n\n\"What's your job?\" Mulden asked eagerly.\n\n\"Well, this is the strangest part. I'm to be the Dictator's\nconfidential assistant.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" Mulden cried. \"It makes sense. Don't you see, Sinclair?\nWe're not the only ones. There are others, inside the government, who\nthink it's time for a _coup_. With their help, Ellaby won't fail us.\"\n\nDorcas Sinclair wasn't convinced. \"Doesn't it seem peculiar to you\nthat, purely by co-incidence, Ellaby happened to meet these people?\"\n\nBut Mulden shrugged. \"You know the old saw about the gift horse,\" he\nsaid. \"Ellaby will go ahead with the plan. Tomorrow, if all goes well,\nwe'll have a full-scale revolution on our hands. Don't you understand,\nSinclair? The Dictator--a figurehead. There are plenty of people\naround like us, who don't want to do things just because everyone else\ndoes them, who don't want to be stamped by the mold of conformity, who\ndon't want ... but I don't have to go on. The Dictator is a\nfigurehead, a symbol of power. Destroy him and the whole conforming\nsystem comes tumbling down in chaos. You'll see tomorrow.\"\n\nIt was all beyond Ellaby, who was still weary from the playback\nordeals. He took the small, palm-sized blaster from Mulden and slipped\nit into his tunic. Tomorrow he would assassinate the Dictator and\nsuffer the consequences. He almost had in mind to rebel. The people at\ntesting had been very nice--except for those earphones. But the\nSinclair woman and Mulden might be able to do as bad--or worse. He'd\ngo through with it.\n\nUnder the circumstances, he slept surprisingly well.\n\n\n\nMulden's passionate parting words still ringing in his ears, Ellaby\nentered the capitol building. \"Someday you and your kind will\nunderstand, Ellaby,\" Mulden had said. \"Someday you'll know what banal\nreally means, and vulgar. Someday--I promise you, someday--the true\nsocial perspective will be re-established. It should not be the role\nin life of the common man, the mass, the mob, to make the uncommon man\nas common as possible, but quite the other way around. The other way,\nEllaby! Common folk should be given the opportunity to become as\nuncommon as possible. Otherwise, Ellaby, we've reached a dead end.\n\n\"Kill him and I promise you this: the whole warped system will come\ntumbling. A man shouldn't be forced to conform, Ellaby. Mankind's\ngreatness stems from lack of conformity. For his own purposes, the\nDictator bows to the will of the mob. But he's surrounded himself,\nwith mediocrity. Without him, what can they do? Without him they'll go\ndown in weeks, Ellaby. In days!\"\n\nThe guard, a tall blonde woman who looked like a twenty-over-mode to\nEllaby, led him down a long, well-lit corridor. No one had searched\nhim. It would have taken the guard a moment to reach within his tunic,\nfind the blaster and drag him off to the Academy. Other people,\nnameless people on nameless errands, walked by in the corridor without\npaying Ellaby any attention.\n\nWas Mulden right? Were there people here, within the building, waiting\nto help Ellaby?\n\nEllaby licked his dry lips and kept walking, finding it difficult to\nkeep his legs from trembling. It was as if a nimbus of terror dogged\nhis footsteps, ready to envelope him momentarily. The guard seemed\ncompletely unconcerned. She was humming the melody of the latest\nsong-hit, a wonderfully liltingly banal tune which had been on\neveryone's lips back in High Falls.\n\nThe blonde guard paused before a door in the long corridor. \"Here we\nare,\" she said.\n\nEllaby opened his mouth to speak, but gulped in air instead. He felt a\nweak fluttering in his chest. He had never been so afraid in all his\nlife.\n\nThe guard, who was a head taller than Ellaby, glanced down at him.\n\"You don't have to be so nervous,\" she said in a perfectly normal\nvoice. \"Everything's going to be all right.\"\n\n\"You see, it's a new job and all--\"\n\n\"Oh, here! Let's see that blaster.\"\n\nEllaby's heart plunged. He wanted to bolt, to run. She knew. She\nknew....\n\nHe stood there, too weak to move, while the guard reached inside his\ntunic, found the blaster taped to his chest, wrenched it loose. She\ntook it out, held it up, flipping open the chamber and examined the\ninside. \"All right,\" she said. \"I only wanted to make sure it was\nloaded.\"\n\nAnd she took out a key and opened the door. \"He's inside,\" she said,\nand strolled on down the hall.\n\n\n\nEllaby clutched the doorframe for support. He was breathing raggedly\nnow, as if he'd run all the great length of the corridor, sprinting\nwith monsters behind him. He rubbed the shoulder of his tunic against\nhis damp brow and entered the room.\n\nA man Ellaby's own size was sitting there, viewing a 3D. When he heard\nEllaby at the door he got up. He looked very unhappy as Ellaby\npointed the blaster at him. He said, \"So soon?\"\n\n\"They said you would try wiles, trickery, deceit,\" Ellaby recited.\n\"You won't fool me.\"\n\n\"You think I'm the Dictator? You're going to kill me? That's very\nfunny. I know, you see. I know.\"\n\n\"Stand back!\" Ellaby screamed.\n\n\"I assure you, I am not the Dictator any more than you will be--\"\n\nThe Dictator's face dissolved in a red, jelly-like smear as Ellaby\npulled this trigger of his blaster.\n\nHe spent the next ten minutes being very ill.\n\nAfterwards, they were very efficient. They carted the body away and told\nEllaby all he had to do was ring for food or drink or anything he wanted.\nOccasionally, he would sign some papers. Occasionally--masked--he might be\nasked to review a parade.\n\nAnd all at once, sitting alone in the room with its pleasant view, it\ncame to Ellaby. He passed no judgment, but he understood--and he was\nafraid.\n\nThe masses ruled, thought Ellaby, hardly knowing what the phrase\nmeant. The system was self-perpetuating, and revolution couldn't\nchange it. The common man--men like Ellaby--had come into his own, for\nonce and for all time.\n\nThe man Ellaby had slain was no Dictator. He had tried to tell Ellaby\nthat before he perished. Now Ellaby had taken his place. Ellaby was no\nDictator, either.\n\nBut he would do until the next one came along.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
