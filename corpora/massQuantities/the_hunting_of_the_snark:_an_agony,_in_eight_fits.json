Clay, Sons, and Taylor, Printers,\n  Bread Street Hill.\n\n\n\n\n  +Inscribed to a dear Child:\n  in memory of golden summer hours\n  and whispers of a summer sea.+\n\n\n  Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task,\n    Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well\n  Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask\n      The tale he loves to tell.\n\n  Rude spirits of the seething outer strife,\n    Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright,\n  Deem, if you list, such hours a waste of life,\n      Empty of all delight!\n\n  Chat on, sweet Maid, and rescue from annoy\n    Hearts that by wiser talk are unbeguiled.\n  Ah, happy he who owns that tenderest joy,\n      The heart-love of a child!\n\n  Away, fond thoughts, and vex my soul no more!\n    Work claims my wakeful nights, my busy days--\n  Albeit bright memories of that sunlit shore\n      Yet haunt my dreaming gaze!\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nIf--and the thing is wildly possible--the charge of writing nonsense\nwere ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem,\nit would be based, I feel convinced, on the line (in p.\u00a018)\n\n  \u201cThen the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes.\u201d\n\nIn view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal\nindignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such\na deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral purpose of\nthis poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously\ninculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in Natural History--I will\ntake the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened.\n\nThe Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used\nto have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished,\nand it more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it,\nthat no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged\nto. They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman\nabout it--he would only refer to his Naval Code, and read out in\npathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had ever been\nable to understand--so it generally ended in its being fastened on,\nanyhow, across the rudder. The helmsman* used to stand by with tears in\nhis eyes: _he_ knew it was all wrong, but alas! Rule 42 of the Code,\n\u201c_No one shall speak to the Man at the Helm_,\u201d had been completed by the\nBellman himself with the words \u201c_and the Man at the Helm shall speak to\nno one_.\u201d So remonstrance was impossible, and no steering could be done\ntill the next varnishing day. During these bewildering intervals the\nship usually sailed backwards.\n\n    [* This office was usually undertaken by the Boots, who found\n    in it a refuge from the Baker\u2019s constant complaints about the\n    insufficient blacking of his three pair of boots.]\n\nAs this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock,\nlet me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been\nasked me, how to pronounce \u201cslithy toves.\u201d The \u201ci\u201d in \u201cslithy\u201d is long,\nas in \u201cwrithe\u201d; and \u201ctoves\u201d is pronounced so as to rhyme with \u201cgroves.\u201d\nAgain, the first \u201co\u201d in \u201cborogoves\u201d is pronounced like the \u201co\u201d in\n\u201cborrow.\u201d I have heard people try to give it the sound of the \u201co\u201d in\n\u201cworry.\u201d Such is Human Perversity.\n\nThis also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in\nthat poem. Humpty-Dumpty\u2019s theory, of two meanings packed into one word\nlike a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all.\n\nFor instance, take the two words \u201cfuming\u201d and \u201cfurious.\u201d Make up your\nmind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will\nsay first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever\nso little towards \u201cfuming,\u201d you will say \u201cfuming-furious;\u201d if they\nturn, by even a hair\u2019s breadth, towards \u201cfurious,\u201d you will say\n\u201cfurious-fuming;\u201d but if you have that rarest of gifts, a perfectly\nbalanced mind, you will say \u201cfrumious.\u201d\n\nSupposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words--\n\n  \u201cUnder which king, Bezonian? Speak or die!\u201d\n\nJustice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard,\nbut had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say\neither name before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die,\nhe would have gasped out \u201cRilchiam!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n+Contents.+\n\n                                        Page\n\n  +Fit the First.

I have said it twice:\n    That alone should encourage the crew.\n  Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:\n    What I tell you three times is true.\u201d\n\n  The crew was complete: it included a Boots--\n    A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--\n  A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--\n    And a Broker, to value their goods.\n\n  A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,\n    Might perhaps have won more than his share--\n  But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,\n    Had the whole of their cash in his care.\n\n  There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,\n    Or would sit making lace in the bow:\n  And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,\n    Though none of the sailors knew how.\n\n  There was one who was famed for the number of things\n    He forgot when he entered the ship:\n  His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,\n    And the clothes he had bought for the trip.\n\n  He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,\n    With his name painted clearly on each:\n  But, since he omitted to mention the fact,\n    They were all left behind on the beach.\n\n  The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because\n    He had seven coats on when he came,\n  With three pair of boots--but the worst of it was,\n    He had wholly forgotten his name.\n\n  He would answer to \u201cHi!\u201d or to any loud cry,\n    Such as \u201cFry me!\u201d or \u201cFritter my wig!\u201d\n  To \u201cWhat-you-may-call-um!\u201d or \u201cWhat-was-his-name!\u201d\n    But especially \u201cThing-um-a-jig!\u201d\n\n  While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,\n    He had different names from these:\n  His intimate friends called him \u201cCandle-ends,\u201d\n    And his enemies \u201cToasted-cheese.\u201d\n\n  \u201cHis form is ungainly--his intellect small--\u201d\n    (So the Bellman would often remark)\n  \u201cBut his courage is perfect! And that, after all,\n    Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.\u201d\n\n  He would joke with hy\u00e6nas, returning their stare\n    With an impudent wag of the head:\n  And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,\n    \u201cJust to keep up its spirits,\u201d he said.\n\n  He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--\n    And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--\n  He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state,\n    No materials were to be had.\n\n  The last of the crew needs especial remark,\n    Though he looked an incredible dunce:\n  He had just one idea--but, that one being \u201cSnark,\u201d\n    The good Bellman engaged him at once.\n\n  He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,\n    When the ship had been sailing a week,\n  He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,\n    And was almost too frightened to speak:\n\n  But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,\n    There was only one Beaver on board;\n  And that was a tame one he had of his own,\n    Whose death would be deeply deplored.\n\n  The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,\n    Protested, with tears in its eyes,\n  That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark\n    Could atone for that dismal surprise!\n\n  It strongly advised that the Butcher should be\n    Conveyed in a separate ship:\n  But the Bellman declared that would never agree\n    With the plans he had made for the trip:\n\n  Navigation was always a difficult art,\n    Though with only one ship and one bell:\n  And he feared he must really decline, for his part,\n    Undertaking another as well.\n\n  The Beaver\u2019s best course was, no doubt, to procure\n    A second-hand dagger-proof coat--\n  So the Baker advised it--and next, to insure\n    Its life in some Office of note:\n\n  This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire\n    (On moderate terms), or for sale,\n  Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,\n    And one Against Damage From Hail.\n\n  Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,\n    Whenever the Butcher was by,\n  The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,\n    And appeared unaccountably shy.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n         FIT II.--THE BELLMAN\u2019S SPEECH.\n\n\n\n\n+Fit the Second.+\n\n_THE BELLMAN\u2019S SPEECH._\n\n\n  The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--\n    Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!\n  Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,\n    The moment one looked in his face!\n\n  He had bought a large map representing the sea,\n    Without the least vestige of land:\n  And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be\n    A map they could all understand.\n\n  \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of Mercator\u2019s North Poles and Equators,\n    Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?\u201d\n  So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply\n    \u201cThey are merely conventional signs!\n\n  \u201cOther maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!\n    But we\u2019ve got our brave Captain to thank\u201d\n  (So the crew would protest) \u201cthat he\u2019s bought us the best--\n    A perfect and absolute blank!\u201d\n\n  This was charming, no doubt: but they shortly found out\n    That the Captain they trusted so well\n  Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,\n    And that was to tingle his bell.\n\n  He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave\n    Were enough to bewilder a crew.\n  When he cried \u201cSteer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!\u201d\n    What on earth was the helmsman to do?\n\n  Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:\n    A thing, as the Bellman remarked,\n  That frequently happens in tropical climes,\n    When a vessel is, so to speak, \u201csnarked.\u201d\n\n  But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,\n    And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,\n  Said he _had_ hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,\n    That the ship would _not_ travel due West!\n\n  But the danger was past--they had landed at last,\n    With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:\n  Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,\n    Which consisted of chasms and crags.\n\n  The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,\n    And repeated in musical tone\n  Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--\n    But the crew would do nothing but groan.\n\n  He served out some grog with a liberal hand,\n    And bade them sit down on the beach:\n  And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,\n    As he stood and delivered his speech.\n\n  \u201cFriends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!\u201d\n    (They were all of them fond of quotations:\n  So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,\n    While he served out additional rations).\n\n  \u201cWe have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,\n    (Four weeks to the month you may mark),\n  But never as yet (\u2019tis your Captain who speaks)\n    Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!\n\n  \u201cWe have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,\n    (Seven days to the week I allow),\n  But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,\n    We have never beheld till now!\n\n  \u201cCome, listen, my men, while I tell you again\n    The five unmistakable marks\n  By which you may know, wheresoever you go,\n    The warranted genuine Snarks.\n\n  \u201cLet us take them in order. The first is the taste,\n    Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:\n  Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,\n    With a flavour of Will-o-the-wisp.\n\n  \u201cIts habit of getting up late you\u2019ll agree\n    That it carries too far, when I say\n  That it frequently breakfasts at five-o\u2019clock tea,\n    And dines on the following day.\n\n  \u201cThe third is its slowness in taking a jest.\n    Should you happen to venture on one,\n  It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:\n    And it always looks grave at a pun.\n\n  \u201cThe fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,\n    Which it constantly carries about,\n  And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--\n    A sentiment open to doubt.\n\n  \u201cThe fifth is ambition. It next will be right\n    To describe each particular batch:\n  Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,\n    From those that have whiskers, and scratch.\n\n  \u201cFor, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,\n    Yet, I feel it my duty to say,\n  Some are Boojums--\u201d The Bellman broke off in alarm,\n    For the Baker had fainted away.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n          FIT III.--THE BAKER\u2019S TALE.\n\n\n\n\n+Fit the Third.+\n\n_THE BAKER\u2019S TALE._\n\n\n  They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--\n    They roused him with mustard and cress--\n  They roused him with jam and judicious advice--\n    They set him conundrums to guess.\n\n  When at length he sat up and was able to speak,\n    His sad story he offered to tell;\n  And the Bellman cried \u201cSilence! Not even a shriek!\u201d\n    And excitedly tingled his bell.\n\n  There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,\n    Scarcely even a howl or a groan,\n  As the man they called \u201cHo!\u201d told his story of woe\n    In an antediluvian tone.\n\n  \u201cMy father and mother were honest, though poor--\u201d\n    \u201cSkip all that!\u201d cried the Bellman in haste.\n  \u201cIf it once becomes dark, there\u2019s no chance of a Snark--\n    We have hardly a minute to waste!\u201d\n\n  \u201cI skip forty years,\u201d said the Baker, in tears,\n    \u201cAnd proceed without further remark\n  To the day when you took me aboard of your ship\n    To help you in hunting the Snark.\n\n  \u201cA dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)\n    Remarked, when I bade him farewell--\u201d\n  \u201cOh, skip your dear uncle!\u201d the Bellman exclaimed,\n    As he angrily tingled his bell.\n\n  \u201cHe remarked to me then,\u201d said that mildest of men,\n    \u201c\u2018If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:\n  Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens,\n    And it\u2019s handy for striking a light.\n\n  \u201c\u2018You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;\n    You may hunt it with forks and hope;\n  You may threaten its life with a railway-share;\n    You may charm it with smiles and soap--\u2019\u201d\n\n  (\u201cThat\u2019s exactly the method,\u201d the Bellman bold\n    In a hasty parenthesis cried,\n  \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the way I have always been told\n    That the capture of Snarks should be tried!\u201d)\n\n  \u201c\u2019But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,\n    If your Snark be a Boojum! For then\n  You will softly and suddenly vanish away,\n    And never be met with again!\u2019\n\n  \u201cIt is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,\n    When I think of my uncle\u2019s last words:\n  And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl\n    Brimming over with quivering curds!\n\n  \u201cIt is this, it is this--\u201d \u201cWe have had that before!\u201d\n    The Bellman indignantly said.\n  And the Baker replied \u201cLet me say it once more.\n    It is this, it is this that I dread!\n\n  \u201cI engage with the Snark--every night after dark--\n    In a dreamy delirious fight:\n  I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,\n    And I use it for striking a light:\n\n  \u201cBut if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,\n    In a moment (of this I am sure),\n  I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--\n    And the notion I cannot endure!\u201d\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n             FIT IV.--THE HUNTING.\n\n\n\n\n+Fit the Fourth.+\n\n_THE HUNTING._\n\n\n  The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.\n    \u201cIf only you\u2019d spoken before!\n  It\u2019s excessively awkward to mention it now,\n    With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!\n\n  \u201cWe should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,\n    If you never were met with again--\n  But surely, my man, when the voyage began,\n    You might have suggested it then?\n\n  \u201cIt\u2019s excessively awkward to mention it now--\n    As I think I\u2019ve already remarked.\u201d\n  And the man they called \u201cHi!\u201d replied, with a sigh,\n    \u201cI informed you the day we embarked.\n\n  \u201cYou may charge me with murder--or want of sense--\n    (We are all of us weak at times):\n  But the slightest approach to a false pretence\n    Was never among my crimes!\n\n  \u201cI said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--\n    I said it in German and Greek:\n  But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)\n    That English is what you speak!\u201d\n\n  \u201c\u2019Tis a pitiful tale,\u201d said the Bellman, whose face\n    Had grown longer at every word:\n  \u201cBut, now that you\u2019ve stated the whole of your case,\n    More debate would be simply absurd.\n\n  \u201cThe rest of my speech\u201d (he explained to his men)\n    \u201cYou shall hear when I\u2019ve leisure to speak it.\n  But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!\n    \u2019Tis your glorious duty to seek it!\n\n  \u201cTo seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;\n    To pursue it with forks and hope;\n  To threaten its life with a railway-share;\n    To charm it with smiles and soap!\n\n  \u201cFor the Snark\u2019s a peculiar creature, that won\u2019t\n    Be caught in a commonplace way.\n  Do all that you know, and try all that you don\u2019t:\n    Not a chance must be wasted to-day!\n\n  \u201cFor England expects--I forbear to proceed:\n    \u2019Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:\n  And you\u2019d best be unpacking the things that you need\n    To rig yourselves out for the fight.\u201d\n\n  Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),\n    And changed his loose silver for notes.\n  The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,\n    And shook the dust out of his coats.\n\n  The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--\n    Each working the grindstone in turn:\n  But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed\n    No interest in the concern:\n\n  Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,\n    And vainly proceeded to cite\n  A number of cases, in which making laces\n    Had been proved an infringement of right.\n\n  The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned\n    A novel arrangement of bows:\n  While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand\n    Was chalking the tip of his nose.\n\n  But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,\n    With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--\n  Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,\n    Which the Bellman declared was all \u201cstuff.\u201d\n\n  \u201cIntroduce me, now there\u2019s a good fellow,\u201d he said,\n    \u201cIf we happen to meet it together!\u201d\n  And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,\n    Said \u201cThat must depend on the weather.\u201d\n\n  The Beaver went simply galumphing about,\n    At seeing the Butcher so shy:\n  And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,\n    Made an effort to wink with one eye.\n\n  \u201cBe a man!\u201d said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard\n    The Butcher beginning to sob.\n  \u201cShould we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,\n    We shall need all our strength for the job!\u201d\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n          FIT V.--THE BEAVER\u2019S LESSON.\n\n\n\n\n+Fit the Fifth.+\n\n_THE BEAVER\u2019S LESSON._\n\n\n  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n    They pursued it with forks and hope;\n  They threatened its life with a railway-share;\n    They charmed it with smiles and soap.\n\n  Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan\n    For making a separate sally;\n  And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,\n    A dismal and desolate valley.\n\n  But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:\n    It had chosen the very same place:\n  Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,\n    The disgust that appeared in his face.\n\n  Each thought he was thinking of nothing but \u201cSnark\u201d\n    And the glorious work of the day;\n  And each tried to pretend that he did not remark\n    That the other was going that way.\n\n  But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,\n    And the evening got darker and colder,\n  Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)\n    They marched along shoulder to shoulder.\n\n  Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,\n    And they knew that some danger was near:\n  The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,\n    And even the Butcher felt queer.\n\n  He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--\n    That blissful and innocent state--\n  The sound so exactly recalled to his mind\n    A pencil that squeaks on a slate!\n\n  \u201c\u2019Tis the voice of the Jubjub!\u201d he suddenly cried.\n    (This man, that they used to call \u201cDunce.\u201d)\n  \u201cAs the Bellman would tell you,\u201d he added with pride,\n    \u201cI have uttered that sentiment once.\n\n  \u201c\u2019Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;\n    You will find I have told it you twice.\n  \u2019Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,\n    If only I\u2019ve stated it thrice.\u201d\n\n  The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,\n    Attending to every word:\n  But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,\n    When the third repetition occurred.\n\n  It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,\n    It had somehow contrived to lose count,\n  And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains\n    By reckoning up the amount.\n\n  \u201cTwo added to one--if that could but be done,\u201d\n    It said, \u201cwith one\u2019s fingers and thumbs!\u201d\n  Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,\n    It had taken no pains with its sums.\n\n  \u201cThe thing can be done,\u201d said the Butcher, \u201cI think.\n    The thing must be done, I am sure.\n  The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,\n    The best there is time to procure.\u201d\n\n  The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,\n    And ink in unfailing supplies:\n  While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,\n    And watched them with wondering eyes.\n\n  So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,\n    As he wrote with a pen in each hand,\n  And explained all the while in a popular style\n    Which the Beaver could well understand.\n\n  \u201cTaking Three as the subject to reason about--\n    A convenient number to state--\n  We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out\n    By One Thousand diminished by Eight.\n\n  \u201cThe result we proceed to divide, as you see,\n    By Nine Hundred and Ninety and Two:\n  Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be\n    Exactly and perfectly true.\n\n  \u201cThe method employed I would gladly explain,\n    While I have it so clear in my head,\n  If I had but the time and you had but the brain--\n    But much yet remains to be said.\n\n  \u201cIn one moment I\u2019ve seen what has hitherto been\n    Enveloped in absolute mystery,\n  And without extra charge I will give you at large\n    A Lesson in Natural History.\u201d\n\n  In his genial way he proceeded to say\n    (Forgetting all laws of propriety,\n  And that giving instruction, without introduction,\n    Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),\n\n  \u201cAs to temper the Jubjub\u2019s a desperate bird,\n    Since it lives in perpetual passion:\n  Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--\n    It is ages ahead of the fashion:\n\n  \u201cBut it knows any friend it has met once before:\n    It never will look at a bribe:\n  And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,\n    And collects--though it does not subscribe.\n\n  \u201cIts flavour when cooked is more exquisite far\n    Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:\n  (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,\n    And some, in mahogany kegs:)\n\n  \u201cYou boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:\n    You condense it with locusts and tape:\n  Still keeping one principal object in view--\n    To preserve its symmetrical shape.\u201d\n\n  The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,\n    But he felt that the Lesson must end,\n  And he wept with delight in attempting to say\n    He considered the Beaver his friend.\n\n  While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks\n    More eloquent even than tears,\n  It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books\n    Would have taught it in seventy years.\n\n  They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned\n    (For a moment) with noble emotion,\n  Said \u201cThis amply repays all the wearisome days\n    We have spent on the billowy ocean!\u201d\n\n  Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,\n    Have seldom if ever been known;\n  In winter or summer, \u2019twas always the same--\n    You could never meet either alone.\n\n  And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds\n    Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour--\n  The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,\n    And cemented their friendship for ever!\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n        FIT VI.--THE BARRISTER\u2019S DREAM.\n\n\n\n\n+Fit the Sixth.+\n\n_THE BARRISTER\u2019S DREAM._\n\n\n  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n    They pursued it with forks and hope;\n  They threatened its life with a railway-share;\n    They charmed it with smiles and soap.\n\n  But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain\n    That the Beaver\u2019s lace-making was wrong,\n  Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain\n    That his fancy had dwelt on so long.\n\n  He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,\n    Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,\n  Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig\n    On the charge of deserting its sty.\n\n  The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,\n    That the sty was deserted when found:\n  And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law\n    In a soft under-current of sound.\n\n  The indictment had never been clearly expressed,\n    And it seemed that the Snark had begun,\n  And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed\n    What the pig was supposed to have done.\n\n  The Jury had each formed a different view\n    (Long before the indictment was read),\n  And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew\n    One word that the others had said.\n\n  \u201cYou must know--\u201d said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed \u201cFudge!\n    That statute is obsolete quite!\n  Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends\n    On an ancient manorial right.\n\n  \u201cIn the matter of Treason the pig would appear\n    To have aided, but scarcely abetted:\n  While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,\n    If you grant the plea \u2018never indebted.\u2019\n\n  \u201cThe fact of Desertion I will not dispute:\n    But its guilt, as I trust, is removed\n  (So far as relates to the costs of this suit)\n    By the Alibi which has been proved.\n\n  \u201cMy poor client\u2019s fate now depends on your votes.\u201d\n    Here the speaker sat down in his place,\n  And directed the Judge to refer to his notes\n    And briefly to sum up the case.\n\n  But the Judge said he never had summed up before;\n    So the Snark undertook it instead,\n  And summed it so well that it came to far more\n    Than the Witnesses ever had said!\n\n  When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,\n    As the word was so puzzling to spell;\n  But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn\u2019t mind\n    Undertaking that duty as well.\n\n  So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,\n    It was spent with the toils of the day:\n  When it said the word \u201cGUILTY!\u201d the Jury all groaned,\n    And some of them fainted away.\n\n  Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite\n    Too nervous to utter a word:\n  When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,\n    And the fall of a pin might be heard.\n\n  \u201cTransportation for life\u201d was the sentence it gave,\n    \u201cAnd _then_ to be fined forty pound.\u201d\n  The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared\n    That the phrase was not legally sound.\n\n  But their wild exultation was suddenly checked\n    When the jailer informed them, with tears,\n  Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,\n    As the pig had been dead for some years.\n\n  The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:\n    But the Snark, though a little aghast,\n  As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,\n    Went bellowing on to the last.\n\n  Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed\n    To grow every moment more clear:\n  Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,\n    Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n          FIT VII.--THE BANKER\u2019S FATE.\n\n\n\n\n+Fit the Seventh.+\n\n_THE BANKER\u2019S FATE._\n\n\n  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n    They pursued it with forks and hope;\n  They threatened its life with a railway-share;\n    They charmed it with smiles and soap.\n\n  And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new\n    It was matter for general remark,\n  Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view\n    In his zeal to discover the Snark.\n\n  But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,\n    A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh\n  And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,\n    For he knew it was useless to fly.\n\n  He offered large discount--he offered a cheque\n    (Drawn \u201cto bearer\u201d) for seven-pounds-ten:\n  But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck\n    And grabbed at the Banker again.\n\n  Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws\n    Went savagely snapping around--\n  He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,\n    Till fainting he fell to the ground.\n\n  The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared\n    Led on by that fear-stricken yell:\n  And the Bellman remarked \u201cIt is just as I feared!\u201d\n    And solemnly tolled on his bell.\n\n  He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace\n    The least likeness to what he had been:\n  While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white--\n    A wonderful thing to be seen!\n\n  To the horror of all who were present that day.\n    He uprose in full evening dress,\n  And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say\n    What his tongue could no longer express.\n\n  Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--\n    And chanted in mimsiest tones\n  Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,\n    While he rattled a couple of bones.\n\n  \u201cLeave him here to his fate--it is getting so late!\u201d\n    The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.\n  \u201cWe have lost half the day. Any further delay,\n    And we sha\u2019n\u2019t catch a Snark before night!\u201d\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n           FIT VIII.--THE VANISHING.\n\n\n\n\n+Fit the Eighth.+\n\n_THE VANISHING._\n\n\n  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\n    They pursued it with forks and hope;\n  They threatened its life with a railway-share;\n    They charmed it with smiles and soap.\n\n  They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,\n    And the Beaver, excited at last,\n  Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,\n    For the daylight was nearly past.\n\n  \u201cThere is Thingumbob shouting!\u201d the Bellman said.\n    \u201cHe is shouting like mad, only hark!\n  He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,\n    He has certainly found a Snark!\u201d\n\n  They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed\n    \u201cHe was always a desperate wag!\u201d\n  They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--\n    On the top of a neighbouring crag,\n\n  Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.\n    In the next, that wild figure they saw\n  (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,\n    While they waited and listened in awe.\n\n  \u201cIt\u2019s a Snark!\u201d was the sound that first came to their ears,\n    And seemed almost too good to be true.\n  Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:\n    Then the ominous words \u201cIt\u2019s a Boo-\u201d\n\n  Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air\n    A weary and wandering sigh\n  That sounded like \u201c-jum!\u201d but the others declare\n    It was only a breeze that went by.\n\n  They hunted till darkness came on, but they found\n    Not a button, or feather, or mark,\n  By which they could tell that they stood on the ground\n    Where the Baker had met with the Snark.\n\n  In the midst of the word he was trying to say,\n    In the midst of his laughter and glee,\n  He had softly and suddenly vanished away--\n    For the Snark _was_ a Boojum, you see.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n  LONDON:\n  R.
