And Reggie was always happy when the immediate future held the\nprospects of a drink.\n\nHe nodded brightly to a uniformed attendant.\n\n\"Glorious morning, isn't he?\" he said.\n\n\"It was a glorious morning,\" the attendant corrected politely.\n\nReggie looked blankly at a clock on the wall and a puzzled frown spread\nover his equine features.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he muttered, shaking his head, \"how'd that happen?\" He\nsauntered on toward the bar, nibbling at a hang nail. The morning had\nslipped away from him somehow. Here it was two o'clock in the afternoon\nalready. It was quite a blow.\n\nHe remembered then that he had slept until twelve thirty and he\nbrightened considerably. That explained it. Whistling merrily he strode\non into the dim cool bar, with its heavy brown fixtures and solid\natmosphere of masculinity.\n\nThe bartender set up his usual drink and with knowledge born of long\nexperience, immediately began the preparation of a second.\n\nReggie sipped his drink and relaxed.\n\nFor several moments he stood at the bar, lazily contented, his brain\nslowed to about one revolution per minute. Finally he happened to glance\ntoward the end of the bar and he noticed a small, dark, narrow-eyed man\nwatching him closely.\n\nReggie smiled uncertainly and returned to his drink. The dark man at the\nend of the bar was the only other customer and Reggie knew that he was\nnot a member of the club, for he had never seen him before in his life.\n\nReggie finished his drink and when the bartender set another before him\nhe glanced again toward the end of the bar. The little dark man was\nstill there, regarding him, it seemed, with a steady fixed stare.\n\nReggie coughed nervously and gulped his drink. There was something in\nthe dark little man's beady-eyed gaze that disturbed him. He had another\nquick drink and peeked from the corner of his eye at the little dark\nman.\n\nThere was something sinister about the chap, he felt sure. Reggie was\nthe owner of an extremely lurid imagination and now, warmed by the glow\nof alcohol, he began to envision all sorts of wild possibilities.\n\nAfter his fourth drink he was certain that the man was an Axis agent.\nJust why an Axis agent would be staring at him he had no idea, but he\nstill felt sure the man was a Nazi.\n\n\n\nReggie finished his drink and set the glass on the bar. Then he casually\nsauntered toward the door. A few paces from the room's only exit, he\npaused and under the pretense of inspecting a faded sports print on the\nwall, sneaked a quick glance at the dark little man.\n\nThe dark little man was still staring at him with narrowed, shaded eyes.\n\nReggie yawned ostentatiously and inched closer to the door. He was going\nto make a break for it, but it would have to be fast and clever. His\nheart was pounding with more gusto than usual and there were bright\nspots of excitement in his pale cheeks. This new role of dodging the\nGestapo appealed enormously to his comic strip sense of melodrama.\n\nHeadlines popped before his mind's eye.\n\n     REGGIE VAN FIDDLER MAKES ESCAPE!\n\nFrom what he was going to escape he wasn't quite sure, but he felt that\nthe details would be in the body of the news story. Headlines didn't\ntell everything, did they?\n\nWithin a foot of the door he turned casually and took one last look at\nthe little man who was staring so intently at him. Then, with a sudden\nslithering motion, he slipped through the door.\n\nHe collided heavily with a small figure.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he stammered. \"I'm in a bit of a hurry.\"\n\nHe turned and started away, but he had barely taken three strides when\nhe jerked to a stop. An expression of dazed amazement stole over his\nface and his sleepy eyes opened wide.\n\nWheeling suddenly he stared back at the small figure he had collided\nwith. The man was still standing in the corridor that led from the bar,\nregarding Reggie with a fixed, thoughtful expression.\n\nAnd he was the same dark little man Reggie had left _inside_ the bar\nroom seconds before!\n\nReggie gulped audibly. His adam's apple bobbed in his throat like a\nmouse in a sock.\n\n_How had the dark little man gotten out of the bar ahead of him?_\n\nReggie didn't know and he had no inclination to wait and ask questions.\nWith one last incredulous look over his shoulder he wheeled and loped\nacross the lobby, down the marble steps, through the club's revolving\ndoors and into the street.\n\nHe walked swiftly, mopping his forehead with his handkerchief.\n\nThe experience had been an unnerving one. When he reached the end of the\nblock he hailed a cab and gave the driver the address of another bar.\n\nAs the cab rolled across the Loop Reggie settled back and gnawed\nnervously at his finger nails. Thoughtful meditation and analysis were\nnot his strongest suits; in fact any thinking at all was an annoying\nchore to him, but he felt now that he had better bend his brain to the\nproblem of the dark little man whom he'd seen at the club.\n\nThe chap was obviously interested in him, but why? There was no\nreasonable answer to that question, and there was no explanation to the\nway the little fellow had popped up _outside_ the bar, when Reggie had\nseen him, a split-second before, _inside_ the bar.\n\n\n\nReggie was still stewing over these matters when the cab came to a stop\nbefore a swanky glitter joint which catered to afternoon revellers and\njitterbugs of both sexes.\n\nInside the smoky, dimly lighted den of din and discord Reggie forgot his\ntroubles long enough to order a drink, his fifth of the afternoon. He\nwas conscious of a vague buzzing between his ears and there was a\npleasant mellow glow in the region of his solar plexus.\n\nHad it not been for his disturbing experience at the Midland club, he\nwould have been feeling very, very fine.\n\nWhen his drink arrived he sipped it appreciatively and glanced about the\ncrowded bar, looking for a familiar face. In one corner of the room he\nsaw a tall young man in tweeds lounging against the wall with a drink in\nhis hand. With a glad cry Reggie scrambled from his bar stool and\nlurched across the crowded floor, weaving his way with drunken dexterity\nthrough the jitterbugging maniacs.\n\n\"Hi!\" he cried, when he reached the tweed-clad young man's side. \"How've\nyou been, Ricky? Have a drink?\"\n\n\"Been fine,\" the young man answered. \"Got a drink. Name isn't Ricky.\"\n\n\"Not Ricky?\" Reggie shook his head frowning. \"Could've sworn you were\ngood old Ricky Davis, chap I knew at school. Well, how're things?\"\n\n\"Good,\" the young man answered. \"Have a drink?\"\n\n\"Got one,\" Reggie said. \"Got to go now. It's been nice seeing you again,\nRicky.\"\n\nHe started to weave his way back to the bar. Suddenly he stopped, his\neyes focusing in fascination on the figure of a man at the bar. A man\nwho had appropriated the seat which Reggie had vacated.\n\nThe man was small and dark. His eyes were narrow and inscrutable. He was\nthe same person Reggie had seen at the club.\n\nThe breath left Reggie's lungs in a rush.\n\nObviously the man had followed him here!\n\nAs he stood, transfixed, in the middle of the floor, the man turned and\nlooked straight at him, a peculiar thoughtful expression on his dark\nface. After studying Reggie for a long interval he turned slowly back to\nthe bar.\n\nReggie swallowed what was left of his drink in one gulp, but the liquor\nhad no effect on him. After the shock he'd received it would take liquid\ndynamite to bolster him up.\n\nHe reeled back to the tall young man who was leaning against the wall.\n\n\"Ricky!\" he cried hoarsely. \"I'm being followed. Axis agents are after\nme.\"\n\n\"Name isn't Ricky,\" the tall young man said. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Why what?\" Reggie said blankly. He seemed to have fumbled the\nconversational ball. He wished the young man would speak with more\nclarity and add a few articles and pronouns to his sentences.\n\n\"Why are they following you?\" the young man said peevishly. \"Nothing\nbetter to do?\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" Reggie said. \"I don't know why I'm being followed. But\neverywhere I go this little man sticks to me like a postage stamp.\"\n\n\"Where is he now?\"\n\nReggie pointed dramatically at the dark little man.\n\n\"At the bar. He took the stool I left. He's right between that fat old\nman and that young girl with the red hair.\"\n\n\n\nThe tweed-clad young man stared in the direction of Reggie's pointing\nfinger, then he frowned and glanced down at Reggie.\n\n\"Any pink elephants, yet?\"\n\n\"I'm not drunk,\" Reggie said indignantly. \"That man has been following\nme like a conga partner all afternoon.\"\n\nThe tall young man patted Reggie patiently on the shoulder.\n\n\"Sleep and rest will make a new man of you,\" he said. \"Go home. Go to\nbed. You've got hallucinations.\"\n\n\"Hallucinations!\" Reggie cried over the din of the orchestra. \"What do\nyou mean? Don't you see the man I mean? Right between the fat old man\nand the girl with the red hair?\"\n\nThe tweedish young man shook his head.\n\n\"The stool between the fat old man and the red-haired girl is completely\nunoccupied,\" he said in the patient voice of a man instructing a very\nyoung child.\n\nReggie shook his head bewilderedly. There was a sudden cold hollow in\nthe pit of his stomach. He opened and closed his mouth several times\nwithout producing a sound.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" he finally managed to gasp.\n\n\"Certainly,\" the young man answered. \"There's no one on the bar stool\nyou left. You're just seeing things. Take my advice and go home. You've\nhad too much giggle water.\"\n\nReggie set his drink down hastily. For a long deliberate moment he\nstudied the back of the dark little man at the bar. Then he shook his\nhead dazedly. Maybe this was all some wild product of his imagination.\nMaybe he _was_ having hallucinations....\n\nHe shook his head again and then he shook hands with the young man in\nthe tweed suit.\n\n\"I'm going home, Ricky,\" he said firmly. \"Say hello to all the gang for\nme.\"\n\n\"Name isn't Ricky,\" the young man said, sipping from his drink, \"but\nI'll tell the boys you were asking.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Reggie said.\n\nHe left the crowded bar by a back entrance. The warm sunshine was\npleasant and reassuring. People hurried past him, traffic surged in the\nstreets, and everything was quite normal. He breathed a deep sigh and\nhailed a cab. He gave the driver the address of his apartment and then\nsettled back against the soft leather cushions.\n\nSleep was all he needed. That was all.\n\n\n\nWhen he reached his apartment on the near North Side he had succeeded in\nconvincing himself that his peculiar experiences of the afternoon were\nonly products of his fevered imagination.\n\nAs he let himself into his apartment he had firmly resolved to strictly\nration his reading of comic strips and spy magazines. They were pretty\nstrong meat if they weren't handled with discretion.\n\nThe pleasantly furnished living room of his apartment was shrouded in\nlate-afternoon semi-darkness and, when he closed and locked the door\nbehind him, he switched on the lights.\n\nThe first thing he saw when he walked into the room was the little dark\nman whom he'd seen at the Club and at the bar a few minutes previously.\n\nThe dark little man was sitting in a straight chair, his hands resting\non his knees. There was a faint smile on his face as he studied Reggie\nwith calm, inscrutable eyes.\n\nReggie staggered back a few steps, clapping one hand hysterically to his\nforehead. He couldn't believe his eyes. He had left this man at a bar in\nthe Loop, but here he was now, sitting calmly and unconcernedly in the\nliving room of his apartment.\n\n\"How did you get in here?\" he gasped.\n\nThe dark little man stood up and smiled.\n\n\"Is that important?\" he asked softly. \"I am here and that is all that\nmatters.\"\n\nReggie swallowed loudly. There was something disturbing about the calm\nambiguity of the man's statement. He rubbed his damp palms together\nnervously.\n\n\"Can I get you a drink?\" he blurted.\n\nThe dark little man shook his head slowly.\n\nReggie looked at him uneasily, noticing him in detail for the first\ntime. He was small, hardly more than five feet two and he was slenderly\nbuilt. His hair was jet black and it combed straight back from a high,\ndelicate forehead. He wore severely tailored black clothes that fitted\nhis small frame without a wrinkle. But his eyes dominated his entire\npersonality, for they were a cold chilling black, lusterless and\nunwinking, as unrevealing as twin diamonds.\n\nReggie shivered slightly and looked wistfully toward the door of the\napartment. He coughed nervously.\n\n\"Sorry to seem rude,\" he said, laughing weakly, \"but I've got to be\ntoddling off now. It's been nice--er--running into you. There are\nmagazines on the table, liquor in the ice box, so just make yourself at\nhome.\"\n\nHe backed cautiously toward the door, smiling nervously.\n\n\"Don't wait up for me,\" he said. \"I've--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" the dark little man said quietly, \"I must talk with you.\"\n\n\"Some other time,\" Reggie said, feeling behind him for the door knob.\n\"Awfully rushed just now. Sorry but--\"\n\n\"Wait!\" the little man said again, but this time his voice cracked like\na whip. \"Didn't you hear me? I must talk with you?\"\n\n\n\nReggie jumped at the cracking tone of the man's voice. His hand jerked\naway from the door knob as if it were red hot.\n\n\"Oh, you want to talk to me?\" he said foolishly. \"I didn't understand\nyou.\"\n\n\"My name,\" the little man said, \"is,\" he paused and smiled cryptically,\n\"Demise.\"\n\n\"Glad to know you,\" Reggie said. \"My name is--\"\n\n\"I know your name,\" Mr. Demise said. \"I know everything about you,\nReginald Van Fiddler. I know things about you that you don't know\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Do you now?\" Reggie said, becoming interested in spite of himself. \"For\ninstance?\"\n\n\"I know that you are about to take a long trip,\" Mr. Demise said.\n\n\"That's not news,\" Reggie said. \"My draft board just classified me 1-A.\nI'll be taking a long trip very shortly.\"\n\n\"That is not the trip I am referring to,\" Mr. Demise said. \"You are\ngoing on a trip with me.\"\n\nReggie blinked. He couldn't think of anyone with whom he would rather\nnot take a trip than this dark, sinister little man who called himself\nMr. Demise. What did Demise mean, anyway?\n\n\"It's nice of you, and all that,\" he said, \"but I don't think I'll be\nable to make it. My draft board might not like it.\"\n\n\"They will understand,\" Mr. Demise said.\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" Reggie said. He was beginning really to\nworry. There was something damnably inevitable about Mr. Demise's calm\nstatements. \"They're pretty ticklish about such things. I think we'd\njust better forget the whole idea.\"\n\n\"That is impossible,\" Mr. Demise said.\n\nReggie rubbed his moist palms on his trouser legs.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked hesitantly. \"Have you been following me around\nall day just to sell me on the idea of a trip? Are you from Cook's\ntours?\"\n\nMr. Demise smiled and shook his head.\n\n\"I am not interested in selling you the idea of a trip. I am simply\ntelling you that you are going on a trip. I have already made all the\narrangements. There is nothing that can possibly change them.\"\n\n\"Where am I going?\" Reggie asked. His voice was a whisper.\n\n\"With me,\" Mr. Demise said.\n\n\"That's no answer,\" Reggie said, clutching at straws. \"Who are you?\nWhere are you going?\"\n\nMr. Demise smiled again, very faintly. He walked slowly to the\nmantelpiece and plucked a rose from a vase. His hand closed gently over\nthe flower as he turned to face Reggie.\n\n\"Perhaps this will answer your questions,\" he said softly.\n\nHe opened his hand and dropped the flower to the floor at Reggie's feet.\nReggie's eyes widened in sheer amazement.\n\nFor the soft glowing beauty of the flower was faded forever. It lay on\nthe floor, a blackened, dead reminder of its former glory.\n\n\"It's dead,\" he said incredulously. \"It withered at the touch of your\nhand.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Demise nodded slowly and there was a wistful sadness in his face.\n\n\"All living things die at my touch,\" he said. \"For I am Death!\"\n\n\"Death!\" Reggie echoed. For an instant he stared blankly at Mr. Demise.\n\"Death!\" he repeated. \"Why that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever\nheard.\" He actually felt a sensation of relief in the realization that\nhe'd been entertaining some loony instead of an Axis agent as he'd\nfeared. \"You're off your trolley,\" he said to Mr. Demise. \"You'd better\nget moving before your keeper finds you. Death! What a gag!\"\n\n\"I assure you it is not a gag,\" Mr. Demise said slowly. \"Your time is\nnear at hand and I have been sent to take you to the land of Darkness.\"\n\n\"Think again, chum,\" Reggie said emphatically. \"I'm not going to Harlem\nwith you or anyone else and that's final.\"\n\n\"It is useless to protest,\" Mr. Demise said. \"Your destiny is sealed.\nYou must come with me.\"\n\n\"You are plain balmy,\" Reggie said. \"I've never heard a sillier yarn in\nmy life. So you're Death, are you?\"\n\nMr. Demise nodded. \"I am one of his agents.\"\n\n\"Changing your story a little, aren't you?\" Reggie said triumphantly.\n\"Well, since when has Death been announced by personal messengers? A man\nsteps in front of a car. He's killed. That's all there is to it. There\naren't little black men standing on the curb pushing him into the\nstreet, are there? And they don't come around a couple of hours in\nadvance tipping him off, do they? No!\"\n\n\"When a mortal passes over,\" Mr. Demise said, \"there is always an agent\nof Death present superintending the details. But he is not always\nvisible to his charge.\"\n\nReggie poured himself a drink and lit a cigarette.\n\n\"Well, thanks just the same,\" he said, \"but I don't want any special\neffects when I pass over. If there's a messenger of Death around I don't\n_want_ to see him. Just let him stay invisible. That's the way I want\nit.\"\n\nMr. Demise looked slightly pained. There was an embarrassed look on his\nnormally expressionless features.\n\n\"Usually the agent of Death is invisible,\" he said. \"In fact his orders\nare to remain invisible under all circumstances.\"\n\n\"Okay then,\" Reggie said. \"You're breaking orders. Be a nice obedient\nchum now and fade away.\"\n\nMr. Demise shrugged and stepped backward--_and suddenly he was gone_! He\nhad disappeared into thin air, soundlessly, instantaneously.\n\n\"Why what?\" Reggie said blandly. He started to sip his drink when\nsuddenly the full realization of what had happened burst on him. The\ndrink fell from his nerveless fingers with a crash.\n\nHe stared frantically about the room.\n\n_Mr. Demise was gone!_ It was incredible! It was unbelievable! But it\nwas a fact!\n\nHe poured himself another drink and drained it in one breathless gulp.\nHe felt his reason tottering as his gaze swung desperately about the\nroom.\n\n\"Mr. Demise!\" he cried. \"Come back! Where are you!\"\n\n\"I am here before you,\" Mr. Demise's voice sounded in the air. \"Are you\nconvinced now?\"\n\nReggie mopped his forehead weakly.\n\n\"Yes,\" he gasped. \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Demise reappeared as suddenly as he had vanished. He smiled faintly\nat Reggie. He was apparently completely unruffled by his transformation.\n\nReggie poured himself another drink with trembling fingers.\n\n\"D-don't do that any more,\" he pleaded.\n\n\"As you wish,\" Mr. Demise said agreeably. \"I am sorry if I shocked you.\nI can see now that it was a mistake to let you see me in the first\nplace. I understand now why it is strictly forbidden.\"\n\nReggie drained his drink.\n\n\"I wish you hadn't decided to break regulations,\" he said moodily. \"I've\nnever been so upset in all my life. Why didn't you remain invisible, if\nyou're supposed to? You aren't going to creep into people's hearts if\nyou pop up and announce yourself as an agent of Death and start making\nspeeches about whisking them off to the Land of Darkness. People just\ndon't like that sort of thing. By all means stay invisible in the\nfuture.\"\n\nMr. Demise shuffled awkwardly and for the first time his poise seemed\ndeserting him.\n\n\"You're absolutely right,\" he said gloomily. \"But I was curious.\"\n\n\"That's a fine excuse,\" Reggie said scathingly. \"I should think they'd\nget a man of tact and diplomacy for your job. Not some nosy person whose\ncuriosity runs away with him.\"\n\n\"You see,\" Mr. Demise explained miserably, \"you happened to be my first\nassignment. I've had no experience at all in this work and I was curious\nto see what kind of person I was going to take back with me. And I\nwanted to get a first-hand reaction from you.\"\n\nReggie mixed himself another drink. He was beginning to feel\nbelligerent.\n\n\"So?\" he cried. \"They sent an amateur down to get me, did they? I\nsuppose I don't rate an experienced escort. So they sent you. I'm\nsurprised they didn't just tell the office boy to do the job.\"\n\n\"Your levity is poor taste,\" Mr. Demise observed frigidly. \"I can assure\nyou that I am perfectly qualified to act as your guide to the Other\nWorld. I have studied hard to perfect myself for my work and I was\nconsidered one of the outstanding pupils in the class which just\ngraduated. You do not have to relieve your spite by making slighting\nreferences to my professional ability.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" Reggie said. \"If you have any professional ability it hasn't been\nnoticeable so far. You're just out of some college, aren't you? You talk\nlike a college boy. You don't make sense.\"\n\nMr. Demise looked hurt.\n\n\"I'm sorry you're taking this attitude,\" he said. \"I had hoped we could\nbe friends.\"\n\n\"Friends!\" Reggie shrieked. \"Am I expected to be friendly with some\nghoul who comes prowling around threatening to whisk me off to Eternity?\nWhat more do they expect of me? To pay my own way too, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Your passage will be taken care of at the other end,\" Mr. Demise said.\n\"Since you have taken such an ungracious stand we will not dally\nfurther.\"\n\n\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" Reggie said. He felt his throat getting dry. The\nprospects of Death were not pleasant. He didn't want to die right now.\nHe had things to do. There was that badminton match next week with\nSnuffy Smith....\n\n\"Can't we put this thing off a while?\" he asked hopefully. \"There's no\nsense in rushing things, I always say. Why don't you go off and get\nyourself a lot of experience and then come back for me?\"\n\n\"That is impossible,\" Mr. Demise said flatly. He drew from his inside\ncoat pocket a slim black book which he opened to the first page. \"You\nare first on my list and I must carry out my orders to the letter. All\nthe information as to person, place and method is contained in this book\nand it would be impossible to change it.\"\n\n\"Place and method, eh?\" Reggie said weakly. He ran a finger around the\ninside of his collar. \"You mean you've got the dope there on how it's\ngoing to happen and when it's going to happen?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Mr. Demise replied. \"We don't use a hit-or-miss method.\nEverything is worked out to a science. You, for instance, are--\" Mr.\nDemise paused and shook his head. \"No,\" he continued, \"I can't tell you.\nThat is also against instructions.\"\n\n\"You haven't paid much attention to instructions so far,\" Reggie said\nsulkily. \"Can't you give me a hint as to how I'm going to get it?\"\n\nMr. Demise shook his head firmly.\n\n\"That would be an unthinkable breach of conduct,\" he said, shaking his\nhead severely and frowning. \"Absolutely unthinkable.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Reggie said resignedly. There was no point, he realized, in\narguing with this inhuman icicle. \"But let's have a drink before we get\ndown to--er--business.\"\n\n\"I am not allowed to drink while on duty,\" Mr. Demise said primly.\n\n\"For gosh sakes,\" Reggie said disgustedly, \"you weren't thinking about\nyour precious orders and regulations when you followed me around,\nscaring the hell out of me. Oh no! That was all right. But when I ask\nyou to do a little something outside the letter of your instructions\nit's no soap. If there's anything fair in that I can't see it.\"\n\nMr. Demise shuffled uncomfortably.\n\n\"It was indiscreet of me to allow you to see me,\" he said thoughtfully.\n\"Perhaps your objection is justifiable. It might square things a bit if\nI would take a drink with you. Not that I would expect to enjoy the\nstuff but it seems the fair thing to do.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Reggie said.\n\nHe mixed two drinks in somber silence. Because he realized that it was\nprobably the last time he would ever perform that pleasant chore, he put\nhis heart and soul into the task and when he finally handed Mr. Demise\nhis drink it was a veritable masterpiece.\n\nMr. Demise drank the drink--it was a double Martini with a splash of\nQuantro--in one long appreciative gulp. He set the glass down and sighed\ncontentedly.\n\n\"Another?\" Reggie suggested hopefully.\n\n\"No,\" Mr. Demise said, \"one is plenty. As a matter of fact,\" he said,\n\"that's the first drink I ever had. Alcohol is one of our finest helpers\nbut we aren't supposed to touch it. Personally I think its intoxicating\neffect is greatly overrated.\"\n\n\n\nReggie leaned forward and there was a peculiar gleam in his eyes.\n\n\"So that was your first drink, eh?\" he asked. \"And you don't feel\nanything?\"\n\n\"Not a thing,\" said Mr. Demise. \"Of course I notice a certain glow, but\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"Just a certain glow, eh?\" Reggie said.\n\n\"Thash all,\" Mr. Demise said. He sat down suddenly. \"And my tongue ish a\nlil' thick.\"\n\n\"Well, that's only natural,\" Reggie said. He mixed another drink and\nthere was a cryptic smile on his lips. \"Alcohol is a peculiar thing. One\ndrink will addle a person's wits and the second will act as an antidote.\nStrange, isn't it?\"\n\nMr. Demise rocked slightly in the chair. His coal-black eyes were a bit\nglazed. \"Ish very strange,\" he conceded.\n\n\"Possibly you'd like to try the antidote?\" Reggie said casually.\n\n\"Might not be a bad idea,\" said Mr. Demise.\n\nReggie handed him the second drink and watched contentedly as Mr. Demise\ndrank it down. Mr. Demise set down the glass.\n\n\"You wush right,\" he said, slumping against the back of the chair.\n\"Absolutely right. Second drink ish an antidote. Jush what I needed.\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Reggie agreed solemnly.\n\nMr. Demise closed his eyes but he opened them almost immediately. He\nstruggled up to a sitting position.\n\n\"I hash something to do,\" he muttered. His hand groped into the inside\nof his coat, returned with the slim black book. \"Very important,\" he\nmumbled. \"First assignment. Can't have any slip ups.\"\n\nReggie moistened his lips nervously. He eyed the little black book\ncarefully. That might be the way....\n\n\"How about another drink, old boy,\" he said heartily. He mixed one\nquickly, handed it to Mr. Demise. Mr. Demise took it in his left hand\nand Reggie deftly plucked the black book from his right hand. Mr. Demise\nappeared not to notice the exchange. He drank the drink methodically.\n\nReggie tossed the book under a coffee table.\n\nMr. Demise climbed unsteadily to his feet.\n\nReggie took him by the arm. \"What say we go out and have a few quick\nantidotes?\" he suggested.\n\nMr. Demise nodded stupidly. He mumbled something unintelligible and\nallowed Reggie to lead him to the door. Reggie's brain was working at\nfull speed. If he could just ditch Mr. Demise and get back to the book\neverything might be saved. His idea was sheer brilliance....\n\n\n\nTheir first destination was a bar. Reggie found a cab, shoved Mr. Demise\ninside and ordered the driver to one of the dozens of friendly bars with\nwhich he was familiar.\n\nAt the first stop Mr. Demise had two more drinks. When he had drained\nthe second Reggie hauled him to his feet and started for another palate\npalace. His object was to keep Mr. Demise so bewildered and drunk that\nhe would forget his job.\n\nFor a while he succeeded. Mr. Demise followed him helplessly from bar to\nbar and sat tottering on high stools happily pouring fiery intoxicants\ninto his already overburdened stomach.\n\nBut finally he reached the state of saturation where the liquor produced\na steadily diminishing effect. Reggie watched him worriedly and ordered\nmore and more drinks.\n\nBut it was no use.\n\nIn spite of the enormous quantities of liquor he had consumed, Mr.\nDemise was slowly sobering up. His face was losing its blank expression\nand an intelligent gleam was creeping back into his eyes.\n\nHe began to fumble uncertainly through his pockets, a worried expression\nsettling over his features.\n\nReggie slapped him on the back resoundingly.\n\n\"Have a drink!\" he shouted into his ear.\n\nMr. Demise shook his head stubbornly.\n\n\"Got a job to do,\" he muttered. He went slowly through his pockets and\nan expression of horror replaced the worried look on his face.\n\n\"Where's my book?\" he gasped. \"I've lost my book! This is terrible. I've\ngot to find it!\"\n\n\"What book?\" Reggie asked innocently.\n\n\"The book with all the names and places and dates and methods,\" Mr.\nDemise moaned. \"I've lost it.\"\n\nReggie shrugged philosophically.\n\n\"Too bad,\" he said. \"But things are never as black as they seem. Maybe\nit'll turn up somewhere. The thing to do is just sit tight until someone\nfinds it and reports it.\"\n\n\"I can't wait,\" wailed Mr. Demise. \"These things have to happen on\nschedule. There'd be an awful rumpus in the complaint department if I\nstarted sending people up there haphazardly. And I don't even remember\nwhom I've got on the list. You're the only one I'm sure of.\"\n\nReggie choked on his drink.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Demise went on obliviously, \"you're the first. I'm sure of\nthat much. And I'd better send you along right away. I'll do that much\ncorrectly, at least.\"\n\n\"Now, just a minute,\" Reggie said, \"how're you sure you've got me right?\nI looked at that book and I don't think I'm the man you want at all.\"\n\n\"You looked at the book!\" cried Mr. Demise with sudden suspicion. \"So\nthat's where it went. That's why you got me drunk. You stole my book,\nhoping to evade your destiny, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" Reggie said, forcing a note of outraged\nindignation into his voice.\n\n\"Yes you did,\" Mr. Demise said. \"I'm not going to wait a second longer\nin your case. Mr. Fiddler, prepare yourself for a long trip and don't\nplan on coming back.\"\n\n\n\nReggie realized that the jig was up. Mr. Demise had a grim business-like\nnote in his voice and there was no hope of prolonging things further.\nDrastic action was needed, not discussion.\n\nWith a leap like a startled gazelle Reggie left his stool and bounded\nfor the door. Before Mr. Demise could turn around, he was in the street,\nshouting frantically for a cab.\n\nA cab pulled to the curb and Reggie leaped into its dark interior. Over\nhis shoulder he saw Mr. Demise stagger from the bar, a wrathful\nexpression stamped on his dark features.\n\nThe cab started away with a roar. Reggie shouted his address at the\ndriver and squirmed about to peek out the rear window.\n\nHe saw Mr. Demise clambering into another cab.\n\n\"Hurry!\" he shouted to his driver.\n\n\"Life or death, eh?\" the cabby said conversationally.\n\nReggie winced. \"You said it.\"\n\nThe cab caromed around corners, hit the Outer Drive and hurled along\nlike a frightened cotton-tail until it reached the near North side,\nwhere it swung west and sped through the labyrinthine streets that led\nto Reggie's apartment.\n\nFrom the rear window Reggie could see Mr. Demise's cab speeding after\nthem, steadily closing the gap. His palms were moist and the effects of\nthe liquor had completely faded, leaving him horribly sober. There was\nnothing funny about this predicament.\n\nHis cab jolted to a stop and Reggie threw a bill at the driver and\nleaped out and raced into the foyer of his building.\n\nBy a miraculous stroke of luck the elevator was not in use. He slammed\nthe door and jabbed the button and the car started upward with a jerk.\nHe breathed a long shuddering sigh of relief. Maybe there would yet be\ntime....\n\nThe elevator stopped at his floor. Just as he opened the door and\nstepped out, the elevator suddenly dropped back down the shaft. One of\nhis legs dangled down the shaft. With a startled squawk he pulled\nhimself onto the floor landing.\n\nMr. Demise obviously meant business. If he'd been in that elevator\neverything would be all over now. As it was he still had a chance.\n\nHe let himself into his apartment, switched on the light and dove\nunderneath the coffee table. The black book of doom was still there.\nFrantically Reggie opened it to the first page, found his own name.\n\nHe jerked a pencil from his pocket....\n\nHe was still scribbling furiously when the door of the apartment banged\nopen and Mr. Demise strode into the room, his face black as a\nthundercloud.\n\nReggie dropped the pencil and hid the book from view with his body.\n\n\"So!\" Mr. Demise cried. \"You would try to escape?\"\n\nHe raised both hands commandingly in the air.\n\nBefore he could move again Reggie wheeled about.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" he shrieked. He held out the slim black book to Mr.\nDemise. \"I was sure a mistake had been made. Here! Look for yourself.\"\n\n\"I want no more of your tricks,\" Mr. Demise warned ominously.\n\n\"This is no trick,\" Reggie said. \"You should be grateful to me for\ncatching the error in time.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Demise took the book from Reggie and examined it carefully. The\nfrown gradually faded from his face as his eyes lingered on the page. He\nshuffled his feet awkwardly and cleared his throat.\n\n\"It seems,\" he said in a small, chastened voice, \"that a mistake has\nbeen made.\"\n\nReggie's heart pounded with hope.\n\n\"It certainly has,\" he said. \"This entire affair should be reported to\nsomeone. That's what happens when you put inexperienced men on the job.\nYou wind up with a bungled mess.\"\n\n\"I don't know how it happened,\" Mr. Demise said miserably. \"All I can\nsay is I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Fine thing,\" Reggie said stuffily. \"Mess up your job like this and then\nsay you're sorry. I'd advise, Demise, that you lay off the liquor when\nyou're supposed to be working.\"\n\n\"I will in the future,\" Mr. Demise said humbly.\n\n\"See that you do,\" Reggie said sternly. \"Now I'd say you'd better get to\nwork on that first assignment.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will,\" Mr. Demise said. With drooping shoulders he moved slowly\nto the door. With his hand on the knob he turned again to Reggie.\n\n\"I hate to be a pest,\" he said, \"but I'm afraid I don't know how to go\nabout this job. Maybe you could help me. Where can I find this fellow?\"\n\nReggie chuckled and began to mix himself a drink.\n\n\"I'd advise you to try Berchtesgaden,\" he said. \"Just ask anyone you\nmeet. They'll tell you where you can find Adolf Hitler.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Mr. Demise said gratefully. \"I won't slip up on this one.\"\n\n\"See that you don't,\" Reggie said.\n\n\n\n\n",
