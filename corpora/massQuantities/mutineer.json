    "body": "Raging, Trooper Lane hovered three thousand feet above Tammany Square.\n\nThe cool cybrain surgically implanted in him was working on the problem.\nBut Lane had no more patience. They'd sweat, he thought, hating the\nchill air-currents that threw his hovering body this way and that. He\nglared down at the three towers bordering on the Square. He spat, and\nwatched the little white speck fall, fall. _Lock me up in barracks. All\nI wanted was a little time off. Did I fight in Chi for them? Damn right\nI did. Just a little time off, so I shouldn't blow my top. Now the lid's\ngone._\n\nHe was going over all their heads. He'd bowled those city cops over like\npaper dolls, back at the Armory. The black dog was on Lane's back. Old\nMayor himself was going to hear about it.\n\n_Why not? Ain't old Mayor the CinC of the Newyork Troopers?_\n\nThe humming paragrav-paks embedded beneath his shoulder blades held him\nmotionless above Newyork's three administrative towers. Tammany Hall.\nMayor's Palace. Court House. Lane cursed his stupidity. He hadn't found\nout which one was which ahead of time. _They keep Troopers in the Armory\nand teach them how to fight. They don't teach them about their own city,\nthat they'll be fighting for. There's no time. From seven years old up,\nTroopers have too much to learn about fighting._\n\nThe Mayor was behind one of those thousands of windows.\n\nOld cybrain, a gift from the Trooper surgeons, compliments of the city,\nwould have to figure out which one. Blood churned in his veins, nerves\nshrieked with impatience. Lane waited for the electronic brain to come\nup with the answer.\n\nThen his head jerked up, to a distant buzz. There were cops coming. Two\nblack paragrav-boats whirred along the translucent underside of\nNewyork's anti-missile force-shield, the Shell.\n\n_Old cybrain better be fast. Damn fast!_\n\nThe cybrain jolted an impulse through his spine. Lane somersaulted.\nCybrain had taken charge of his motor nerves. Lane's own mind was just\nalong for the ride.\n\n\n\nHis body snapped into a stiff dive position. He began to plummet down,\npicking up speed. His mailed hands glittered like arrowheads out in\nfront. They pointed to a particular window in one of the towers. A\npredatory excitement rippled through him as he sailed down through the\nair. It was like going into battle again. A little red-white-and-green\nflag fluttered on a staff below the window. Whose flag? The city flag\nwas orange and blue. He shrugged away the problem. Cybrain knew what it\nwas doing.\n\nThe little finger of his right hand vibrated in its metal sheath. A pale\nvibray leaped from the lensed fingertip. Breakthrough! The glasstic\npane dissolved. Lane streamed through the window.\n\nThe paragrav-paks cut off. Lane dropped lightly to the floor, inside the\nroom, in battle-crouch. A 3V set was yammering. A girl screamed. Lane's\nhand shot out automatically. A finger vibrated. Out of the corner of his\neye, Lane saw the girl fold to the floor. There was no one else in the\nroom. Lane, still in a crouch, chewed his lip.\n\n_The Mayor?_\n\nHis head swung around and he peered at the 3V set. He saw his own face.\n\n\"Lashing police with his vibray,\" said the announcer, \"Lane broke\nthrough the cordon surrounding Manhattan Armory. Two policemen were\nkilled, four others seriously injured. Tammany Hall has warned that this\nman is extremely dangerous. Citizens are cautioned to keep clear of him.\nLane is an insane killer. He is armed with the latest military weapons.\nA built-in electronic brain controls his reflexes--\"\n\n\"At ease with that jazz,\" said Lane, and a sheathed finger snapped out.\nThere was a loud bang. The 3V screen dissolved into a puddle of\nglasstic.\n\n_The Mayor._\n\nLane strode to the window. The two police boats were hovering above the\ntowers. Lane's mailed hand snapped open a pouch at his belt. He flipped\na fist-sized cube to the floor.\n\nThe force-bomb \"exploded\"--swelled or inflated, really, but with the\nspeed of a blast. Lane glanced out the window. A section of the energy\nglobe bellied out from above. It shaded the view from his window and\nre-entered the tower wall just below.\n\nNow the girl.\n\nHe turned back to the room. \"Wake up, outa-towner.\" He gave the blonde\ngirl a light dose of the vibray to slap her awake.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she said, shakily.\n\nLane grinned. \"Trooper Lane, of the Newyork Special Troops, is all.\" He\nthrew her a mock salute. \"You from outa-town, girlie. I ain't seen a\nNewyork girl with yellow hair in years. Orange or green is the action.\nWhatcha doing in the Mayor's room?\"\n\n\n\nThe girl pushed herself to her feet. Built, Lane saw. She was pretty and\nclean-looking, very out-of-town. She held herself straight and her\nblue-violet eyes snapped at him.\n\n\"What the devil do you think you're doing, soldier? I am a diplomat of\nthe Grassroots Republic of Mars. This is an embassy, if you know what\nthat means.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" said Lane, unconcerned.\n\n\"Well, you should have had brains enough to honor the flag outside this\nwindow. That's the Martian flag, soldier. If you've never heard of\ndiplomatic immunity, you'll suffer for your ignorance.\" Her large, dark\neyes narrowed. \"Who sent you?\"\n\n\"My cybrain sent me.\"\n\nShe went openmouthed. \"You're _Lane_.\"\n\n\"I'm the guy they told you about on the 3V. Where's the Mayor? Ain't\nthis his place?\"\n\n\"No. No, you're in the wrong room. The wrong building. That's the\nMayor's suite over there.\" She pointed. \"See where the balcony is? This\nis the Embassy suite. If you want the Mayor you'll have to go over\nthere.\"\n\n\"Whaddaya know,\" said Lane. \"Cybrain didn't know, no more than me.\"\n\nThe girl noticed the dark swell of the force-globe. \"What's that out\nthere?\"\n\n\"Force-screen. Nothing gets past, except maybe a full-size blaster-beam.\nKeeps cops out. Keeps you in. You anybody important?\"\n\n\"I told you, I'm an ambassador. From Mars. I'm on a diplomatic mission.\"\n\n\"Yeah? Mars a big city?\"\n\nShe stared at him, violet eyes wide. \"The _planet_ Mars.\"\n\n\"Planet? Oh, _that_ Mars. Sure, I've heard of it--you gotta go by\nspaceship. What's your name?\"\n\n\"Gerri Kin. Look, Lane, holding me is no good. It'll just get you in\nworse trouble. What are you trying to do?\"\n\n\"I wanna see the Mayor. Me and my buddies, we just come back from\nfighting in Chi, Gerri. We won. They got a new Mayor out there in Chi.\nHe takes orders from Newyork.\"\n\nGerri Kin said, \"That's what the force-domes did. The perfect defense.\nBut also the road to the return to city-states. Anarchy.\"\n\nLane said, \"Yeah? Well, we done what they wanted us to do. We did the\nfighting for them. So we come back home to Newyork and they lock us up\nin the Armory. Won't pay us. Won't let us go nowhere. They had cops\nguarding us. City cops.\" Lane sneered. \"I busted out. I wanna see the\nMayor and find out why we can't have time off. I don't play games,\nGerri. I go right to the top.\"\n\nLane broke off. There was a hum outside the window. He whirled and\nstared out. The rounded black hulls of the two police paragrav-boats\nwere nosing toward the force-screen. Lane could read the white numbers\npainted on their bows.\n\nA loudspeaker shouted into the room: \"Come out of there, Lane, or we'll\nblast you out.\"\n\n\"You can't,\" Lane called. \"This girl from Mars is here.\"\n\n\"I repeat, Lane--come out or we'll blast you out.\"\n\nLane turned to the girl. \"I thought you were important.\"\n\n\n\nShe stood there with her hands together, calmly looking at him. \"I am.\nBut you are too, to them. Mars is millions of miles away, and you're\nright across the Square from the Mayor's suite.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but--\" Lane shook his head and turned back to the window. \"All\nright, look! Move them boats away and I'll let this girl out!\"\n\n\"No deal, Lane. We're coming in.\" The police boats backed away slowly,\nthen shot straight up, out of the line of vision.\n\nLane looked down at the Square. Far below, the long, gleaming barrel of\na blaster cannon caught the dim light filtering down through Newyork's\nShell. The cannon trundled into the Square on its olive-drab, box-shaped\ncaterpillar mounting and took up a position equidistant from the bases\nof the three towers.\n\nNow a rumble of many voices rose from below. Lane stared down to see a\nlarge crowd gathering in Tammany Square. Sound trucks were rolling to a\nstop around the edges of the crowd. The people were all looking up.\n\nLane looked across the Square. The windows of the tower opposite, the\nones he could see clearly, were crowded with faces. There were white dot\nfaces on the balcony that Gerri Kin had pointed out as the Mayor's\nsuite.\n\nThe voice of a 3V newscaster rolled up from the Square, reechoing\nagainst the tower walls.\n\n\"Lane is holding the Martian Ambassador, Gerri Kin, hostage. You can see\nthe Martian tricolor behind his force-globe. Police are bringing up\nblaster cannon. Lane's defense is a globe of energy similar to the one\nwhich protects Newyork from aerial attack.\"\n\nLane grinned back at Gerri Kin. \"Whole town's down there.\" Then his grin\nfaded. Nice-looking, nice-talking girl like this probably cared a lot\nmore about dying than he did. Why the hell didn't they give him a chance\nto let her out? Maybe he could do it now.\n\nCybrain said no. It said the second he dropped his force-screen, they'd\nblast this room to hell. Poor girl from Mars, she didn't have a chance.\n\nGerri Kin put her hand to her forehead. \"Why did you have to pick my\nroom? Why did they send me to this crazy city? Private soldiers. Twenty\nmillion people living under a Shell like worms in a corpse. Earth is\nsick and it's going to kill me. What's going to happen?\"\n\nLane looked sadly at her. Only two kinds of girls ever went near a\nTrooper--the crazy ones and the ones the city paid. Why did he have to\nbe so near getting killed when he met one he liked? Now that she was\nshowing a little less fear and anger, she was talking straight to him.\nShe was good, but she wasn't acting as if she was too good for him.\n\n\"They'll start shooting pretty quick,\" said Lane. \"I'm sorry about you.\"\n\n\"I wish I could write a letter to my parents,\" she said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Didn't you understand what I said?\"\n\n\"What's a letter?\"\n\n\"You don't know where Mars is. You don't know what a letter is. You\nprobably can't even read and write!\"\n\n\n\nLane shrugged. He carried on the conversation disinterestedly,\nprofessionally relaxed before battle. \"What's these things I can't do?\nThey important?\"\n\n\"Yes. The more I see of this city and its people, the more important I\nrealize they are. You know how to fight, don't you? I'll bet you're\nperfect with those weapons.\"\n\n\"Listen. They been training me to fight since I was a little kid. Why\nshouldn't I be a great little fighter?\"\n\n\"Specialization,\" said the girl from Mars.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Specialization. Everyone I've met in this city is a specialist.\nSocioSpecs run the government. TechnoSpecs run the machinery. Troopers\nfight the wars. And ninety per cent of the people don't work at all\nbecause they're not trained to do anything.\"\n\n\"The Fans,\" said Lane. \"They got it soft. That's them down there, come\nto watch the fight.\"\n\n\"You know why you were kept in the Armory, Lane? I heard them talking\nabout it, at the dinner I went to last night.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because they're afraid of the Troopers. You men did too good a job out\nin Chi. You are the deadliest weapon that has ever been made. You.\nSingle airborne infantrymen!\"\n\nLane said, \"They told us in Trooper Academy that it's the men that win\nthe wars.\"\n\n\"Yes, but people had forgotten it until the SocioSpecs of Newyork came\nup with the Troopers. Before the Troopers, governments concentrated on\nthe big weapons, the missiles, the bombs. And the cities, with the\nShells, were safe from bombs. They learned to be self-sufficient under\nthe Shells. They were so safe, so isolated, that national governments\ncollapsed. But you Troopers wiped out that feeling of security, when you\ninfiltrated Chi and conquered it.\"\n\n\"We scared them, huh?\"\n\nGerri said, \"You scared them so much that they were afraid to let you\nhave a furlough in the city when you came back. Afraid you Troopers\nwould realize that you could easily take over the city if you wanted to.\nYou scared them so much that they'll let me be killed. They'll actually\nrisk trouble with Mars just to kill you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry about you. I mean it, I like--\"\n\nAt that moment a titanic, ear-splitting explosion hurled him to the\ncarpet, deafened and blinded him.\n\nHe recovered and saw Gerri a few feet away, dazed, groping on hands and\nknees.\n\nLane jumped to the window, looked quickly, sprang back. Cybrain pumped\norders to his nervous system.\n\n\"Blaster cannon,\" he said. \"But just one. Gotcha, cybrain. I can beat\nthat.\"\n\nHe picked up the black box that generated his protective screen.\nSnapping it open with thumb-pressure, he turned a small dial. Then he\nwaited.\n\nAgain an enormous, brain-shattering concussion.\n\nAgain Lane and Gerri were thrown to the floor. But this time there was a\nsecond explosion and a blinding flash from below.\n\nLane laughed boyishly and ran to the window.\n\n\"Look!\" he called to Gerri.\n\n\n\nThere was a huge gap in the crowd below. The pavement was blackened and\nshattered to rubble. In and around the open space sprawled dozens of\ntiny black figures, not moving.\n\n\"Backfire,\" said Lane. \"I set the screen to throw their blaster beam\nright back at them.\"\n\n\"And they knew you might--and yet they let a crowd congregate!\"\n\nGerri reeled away from the window, sick.\n\nLane said, \"I can do that a couple times more, but it burns out the\nforce-globe. Then I'm dead.\"\n\nHe heard the 3V newscaster's amplified voice: \"--approximately fifty\nkilled. But Lane is through now. He has been able to outthink police\nwith the help of his cybrain. Now police are feeding the problem to\ntheir giant analogue computer in the sub-basement of the Court House.\nThe police analogue computer will be able to outthink Lane's cybrain,\nwill predict Lane's moves in advance. Four more blaster cannon are\ncoming down Broadway--\"\n\n\"Why don't they clear those people out of the Square?\" Gerri cried.\n\n\"What? Oh, the Fans--nobody clears them out.\" He paused. \"I got one more\nchance to try.\" He raised a mailed glove to his mouth and pressed a\nsmall stud in the wrist. He said, \"Trooper HQ, this is Lane.\"\n\nA voice spoke in his helmet. \"Lane, this is Trooper HQ. We figured you'd\ncall.\"\n\n\"Get me Colonel Klett.\"\n\nThirty seconds passed. Lane could hear the clank of caterpillar treads\nas the mobile blaster cannon rolled into Tammany Square.\n\nThe voice of the commanding officer of the Troopers rasped into Lane's\near: \"Meat-head! You broke out against my orders! _Now_ look at you!\"\n\n\"I knew you didn't mean them orders, sir.\"\n\n\"If you get out of there alive, I'll hang you for disobeying them!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Sir, there's a girl here--somebody important--from Mars. You\nknow, the planet. Sir, she told me we could take over the city if we got\nloose. That right, sir?\"\n\nThere was a pause. \"Your girl from Mars is right, Lane. But it's too\nlate now. If we had moved first, captured the city government, we might\nhave done it. But they're ready for us. They'd chop us down with blaster\ncannon.\"\n\n\"Sir, I'm asking for help. I know you're on my side.\"\n\n\"I am, Lane.\" The voice of Colonel Klett was lower. \"I'd never admit it\nif you had a chance of getting out of there alive. You've had it, son.\nI'd only lose more men trying to rescue you. When they feed the data\ninto that analogue computer, you're finished.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Lane.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Over and out.\"\n\nLane pressed the stud on his gauntlet again. He turned to Gerri.\n\n\"You're okay. I wish I could let you out. Old cybrain says I can't. Says\nif I drop the force-globe for a second, they'll fire into the room, and\nthen we'll both be dead.\"\n\n\n\nGerri stood with folded arms and looked at him. \"Do what you have to do.\nAs far as I can see, you're the only person in this city that has even a\nlittle bit of right on his side.\"\n\nLane laughed. \"Any of them purple-haired broads I know would be crazy\nscared. You're different.\"\n\n\"When my grandparents landed on Mars, they found out that selfishness\nwas a luxury. Martians can't afford it.\"\n\nLane frowned with the effort of thinking. \"You said I had a little right\non my side. That's a good feeling. Nobody ever told me to feel that way\nabout myself before. It'll be better to die knowing that.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said.\n\nThe amplified voice from below said, \"The police analogue computer is\nnow hooked directly to the controls of the blaster cannon battery. It\nwill outguess Lane's cybrain and check his moves ahead of time.\"\n\nLane looked at Gerri. \"How about giving me a kiss before they get us? Be\nnice if I kissed a girl like you just once in my life.\"\n\nShe smiled and walked forward. \"You deserve it, Lane.\"\n\nHe kissed her and it filled him with longings for things he couldn't\nname. Then he stepped back and shook his head. \"It ain't right you\nshould get killed. If I take a dive out that window, they shoot at me,\nnot in here.\"\n\n\"And kill you all the sooner.\"\n\n\"Better than getting burned up in this lousy little room. You also got\nright on your side. There's too many damn Troopers and not enough good\npersons like you. Old cybrain says stay here, but I don't guess I will.\nI'm gonna pay you back for that kiss.\"\n\n\"But you're safe in here!\"\n\n\"Worry about yourself, not about me.\" Lane picked up the force-bomb and\nhanded it to her. \"When I say now, press this. Then take your hand off,\nreal fast. It'll shut off the screen for a second.\"\n\nHe stepped up on to the window ledge. Automatically, the cybrain cut in\nhis paragrav-paks. \"So long, outa-towner. _Now!_\"\n\nHe jumped. He was hurtling across the Square when the blaster cannons\nopened up. They weren't aimed at the window where the little\nred-white-and-green tricolor was flying. But they weren't aimed at Lane,\neither. They were shooting wild.\n\n_Which way now? Looks like I got a chance. Old cybrain says fly right\nfor the cannons._\n\nHe saw the Mayor's balcony ahead. _Go to hell, old cybrain. I'm doing\nall right by myself. I come to see the Mayor, and I'm gonna see him._\n\nLane plunged forward. He heard the shouts of frightened men.\n\nHe swooped over the balcony railing. A man was pointing a blaster pistol\nat him. There were five men on the balcony--emergency! Years of training\nand cybrain took over. Lane's hand shot out, fingers vibrating. As he\ndropped to the balcony floor in battle-crouch, the men slumped around\nhim.\n\nHe had seen the man with the blaster pistol before. It was the Mayor of\nNewyork.\n\nLane stood for a moment in the midst of the sprawled men, the shrieks of\nthe crowd floating up to him. Then he raised his glove to his lips. He\nmade contact with Manhattan Armory.\n\n\"Colonel Klett, sir. You said if we captured the city government we\nmight have a chance. Well, I captured the city government. What do we do\nwith it now?\"\n\n\n\nLane was uncomfortable in his dress uniform. First there had been a\nceremony in Tammany Square inaugurating Newyork's new Military\nProtectorate, and honoring Trooper Lane. Now there was a formal dinner.\nColonel Klett and Gerri Kin sat on either side of Lane.\n\nKlett said, \"Call me an opportunist if you like, Miss Kin, my government\nwill be stable, and Mars can negotiate with it.\" He was a lean,\nsharp-featured man with deep grooves in his face, and gray hair.\n\nGerri shook her head. \"Recognition for a new government takes time. I'm\ngoing back to Mars, and I think they'll send another ambassador next\ntime. Nothing personal--I just don't like it here.\"\n\nLane said, \"I'm going to Mars, too.\"\n\n\"Did she ask you to?\" demanded Klett.\n\nLane shook his head. \"She's got too much class for me. But I like what\nshe told me about Mars. It's healthy, like.\"\n\nKlett frowned. \"If I thought there was a gram of talent involved in your\ncapture of the Mayor, Lane, I'd never release you from duty. But I know\nbetter. You beat that analogue computer by sheer stupidity--by\ndisregarding your cybrain.\"\n\nLane said, \"It wasn't so stupid if it worked.\"\n\n\"That's what bothers me. It calls for a revision in our tactics. We've\ngot a way of beating those big computers now, should anyone use them\nagainst us.\"\n\n\"I just didn't want her to be hurt.\"\n\n\"Exactly. The computer could outguess a machine, like your cybrain. But\nyou introduced a totally unpredictable factor--human emotion. Which\nproves what I, as a military man, have always maintained--that the\ndeadliest weapon in man's arsenal is still, and will always be, the\nindividual soldier.\"\n\n\"What you just said there, sir,\" said Lane. \"That's why I'm leaving\nNewyork.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Colonel Klett.\n\n\"I'm tired of being a weapon, sir. I want to be a human being.\"\n\n\n                                                                   END\n\n\n\n    Work is the elimination of the traces of work.\n\n                                        _--Michelangelo_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
