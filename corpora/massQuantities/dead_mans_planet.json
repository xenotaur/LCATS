    "body": "Outside the ship, it was the sun that blazed angrily. Inside, it was Sam\nWilson's temper. \"Study your lessons,\" he snarled, with a savageness\nthat surprised himself, \"or I'll never let you set foot on this planet\nat all.\"\n\n\"Okay, Pop,\" said Mark, a little white around the nostrils. He looked\nold for so young a kid. \"I didn't mean anything wrong.\"\n\n\"I don't care what you meant. You do as you're told.\"\n\nIn the quiet that followed, broken only by the hum of the\narithmetic-tape, Sam wondered at himself. As kids went, Mark had never\nbeen a nuisance. Certainly Rhoda had never had any trouble with him. But\nRhoda had been altogether different. Sam was tough and he had always got\na sense of satisfaction out of knowing that he was hard-boiled. Or at\nleast that was once true. Rhoda had been sweet, gentle....\n\nHe aroused himself from thoughts of her by calling, \"Mark!\"\n\n\"Yes, Pop?\"\n\nHis voice had been harsher than he had intended. Over the past few weeks\nhe seemed gradually to have been losing control of it. Now, although he\nwas going to do his son a favor, he sounded like a slavemaster\nthreatening a beating. \"You can shut off your arithmetic lesson. We're\ngoing out.\"\n\n\"But didn't you want me--\"\n\n\"I changed my mind.\"\n\nMark seemed more troubled than pleased, as if a father who changed his\nmind so readily was a man to be wary of.\n\n_I'm on edge all the time_, thought Sam, _and I'm getting him that way,\ntoo. I'll have to regain control of myself._\n\n\n\nHe had long ago made all the necessary tests for such possible dangers\nas lack of oxygen and the presence of infectious organisms. On all\ncounts, the planet had passed muster. The sun, whiter than Sol, was\nalmost hot enough to make him forget the chill he carried deep inside\nhim. Almost, but not quite, especially as the air, though breathable,\nwas thin and deficient in nitrogen. The countryside was bleak, inspiring\nin him the thought that there are two kinds of desolation; the one that\nprecedes the coming of Man, and the one which he knows only too well how\nto create wherever he goes. The desolation here was non-human.\n\n\"It--it's like a cemetery, ain't it, Pop?\"\n\nSam looked at his son sharply. Kids of ten were not supposed to know\nmuch about cemeteries. Nor, for that matter, were kids of six, Mark's\nage when the funeral had taken place. Sam hadn't let him attend, but\nevidently the incident had made a deeper impression on his mind than Sam\nhad realized. He would always remember a cemetery as the place where his\nmother lived. Perhaps he missed Rhoda almost as much as his father did.\n\n\"It's different from a cemetery,\" said Sam. \"There's nobody buried here.\nLooks like we're the first human beings ever to set foot on this place.\"\n\n\"Do you think we'll find animals to catch, Pop?\"\n\n\"I don't see signs of any animals.\"\n\nThat was part of Sam's private fiction, that he was looking for strange\nanimals to be sold to zoos or circuses. Actually he was seeking less to\nfind anything new than to lose something he carried with him, and\nsucceeding in neither attempt.\n\nMark shivered in the sun. \"It's kind of lonely,\" he said.\n\n\"More lonely than the ship?\"\n\n\"It's different. It's bigger, so it's more lonely.\"\n\n_I'm not so sure_, argued Sam mentally. _In the ship, we have all of\nspace around us, and nothing's bigger than that. Still, your opinion has\nto be respected. You're almost as great an expert on the various kinds\nof loneliness as I am. The difference is that you're loneliest when\nyou're away from people. I'm loneliest in a crowd. That's why I don't\nmind this planet so much._\n\nHe walked ahead, Mark following almost reluctantly. The ground was rocky\nand the shrub-like vegetation sparse and stunted, ranging in color from\ngreenish gray to brown. It seemed hardly capable of supporting a large\nanimal population. If there were any animals here at all, they were\nprobably too small to be impressive, and would be of little interest to\nexhibitors.\n\nThey walked in silence for a few moments, and then Sam asked, \"Want to\ngo on?\"\n\n\"I want to finish my studying.\"\n\nThat was something new. \"Okay,\" said Sam, and turned back.\n\n\n\nThey were approaching the ship when the sound of a pebble falling came\nto Sam's ears. Automatically, his hand reached for his gun, and he swung\naround to face what might be danger. As he did so, something snarled and\nfled. He could see no sign of motion, but he could hear the scattering\nof other pebbles along a gully as the creature retreated.\n\n\"Looks like we're not alone here, after all,\" he said. \"Wonder what that\nwas.\"\n\n\"It couldn't have been very big,\" said Mark. \"Big animals don't run\naway.\"\n\n\"Not usually, unless they're smart, or they've met people before. I'll\nhave to set traps.\"\n\n\"Do you think maybe if you caught him you could sell him to a circus,\nPop?\"\n\n\"I'll have to see what he's like, first,\" said Sam. He looked around.\n\"If there's one animal, there are likely to be others. It's strange that\nI didn't detect any sign of them.\"\n\nHe put his arm absently over Mark's shoulder. He didn't notice the\nexpression on the kid's face at this unexpected gesture.\n\nWhen they were inside the ship again, Mark said, \"Guess I'd better get\nback to my arithmetic.\"\n\n\"In a minute,\" said Sam. \"I want to talk to you first.\" He dropped\nwearily into a seat, although he had done nothing that should have tired\nhim out. His son looked at him expectantly. \"Mark, do you like traveling\naround with me?\"\n\n\"Sure, Pop, I like to be with you.\"\n\n\"Not seeing anybody else? No other kids, no people of any kind? Just\nbeing with me, learning your lessons from tapes, and having your test\npapers corrected automatically? You don't get tired of it?\"\n\nMark hesitated despite himself. Then he said loyally, \"I'd rather be\nwith you than anybody else. When Mom--when Mom died--I didn't want to\nsee anybody.\"\n\n\"I know how you felt. But that was four years ago. You can't grow up\nalone. Now what you need to do is meet people, learn how they talk and\nthink and feel. You can't learn those things from tapes, and you can't\nlearn them from me.\"\n\nMark said stubbornly, \"I like to be with you.\"\n\n\"I'm not much of a person to be with. Don't think I don't know it. I'm\nmean and surly, and my temper's getting worse by the day. I can't\nassociate with people any more. But _you_ can. I was thinking maybe I'd\nleave you--\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"Not in an orphanage or anything like that. But I have some friends\nwhose kids are growing up--\"\n\n\"No. I won't go. If you send me, I'll run away. I want to be with you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said Sam. \"That's that.\"\n\nBut it wasn't, and he knew it. Even as he went about preparing his\ntraps, he knew it.\n\n\n\nAs it turned out, the only animals he caught in his traps were small\nones which tore themselves in two and then scampered off, each half\nrunning in a different direction. For the animal which had made those\nnoises, no traps were necessary. Later on he heard a noise outside\nagain, and he went out cautiously, gun in hand. The animal backed away,\nbut he saw it, then he heard it bark. So did Mark, who had followed him.\n\nMark's eyes almost popped. It was four years since he had heard the\nsound, but he knew at once what it was. \"Gosh! A dog! How do you s'pose\nhe got here?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Sam. \"Your guess is as good as mine.\"\n\n\"But if we're the first human beings to land here--it ain't possible!\"\n\n\"I know that. But there he is.\"\n\nAt the sound of their voices, the dog broke into a series of furious\nbarks, backing away as it did so.\n\n\"What kind is he, Pop?\"\n\n\"He looks like a mongrel to me. A bad-tempered, medium-sized mongrel\nwith an ugly look about him. Maybe I ought to shoot him and get it over\nwith.\"\n\n\"Shoot him? Don't do that! I want him as a pet.\"\n\n\"He looks too wild to make much of a pet.\"\n\nThe dog gave one last bark of defiance, turned, and fled in the same\ngeneral direction, Sam noticed, as he had run last time.\n\n\"Maybe dogs _do_ grow on other planets, Pop.\"\n\n\"Only if men have brought them there.\"\n\n\"Then that means there was a ship here?\"\n\n\"At some time or other there was a ship. I don't think it was smashed\nup, or I'd have seen wreckage when I cruised around before landing. That\ndog was either left here by mistake, or deliberately marooned.\"\n\n\"Maybe--maybe he's with somebody who's still here.\"\n\n\"Not likely,\" said Sam thoughtfully. \"He wanders around too freely, and\nhe seems unused to the presence of human beings. Besides, no men would\nbe likely to live here long without shelter. And I've seen no sign of\nany house or hut.\"\n\n\"Could he belong to a being that wasn't human?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Sam with certainty. \"Only human beings have been able to\ndomesticate dogs. If a dog is here, a human being was once here. That's\ndefinite.\"\n\n\"He _would_ make a good pet,\" said Mark longingly.\n\n\"Not that one. Maybe I should have got you a dog long ago. It might have\nbeen just the kind of companionship you needed. But you can't make a pet\nof this animal. He's been away from people too long, and he's developed\nsome mean habits.\" And he added mentally, \"_Like me._\"\n\n\"I could train him,\" said Mark. \"He wouldn't be any trouble at all, Pop.\nI'd train him and feed him, and he'd be just like one of us. And--and\nlike you say, Pop, it wouldn't be so lonely for me.\"\n\nKids don't give up easily, thought Sam. All the same, he had an idea\nthat with this dog all the persistence in the world would be useless. He\nshrugged, and said simply, \"We'll see.\" And then they went into the ship\nto eat.\n\n\n\nAll through the meal he could tell that Mark was thinking about the dog.\nThe boy's thoughts seemed to affect his appetite. For the first time,\nhe left some of his proteinex on the plate.\n\n\"I'm not very hungry today,\" he said apologetically. \"Maybe--\" He looked\ninquiringly at his father.\n\n\"Go ahead and finish it,\" said Sam. \"We've got plenty of food. I'll fix\nup something else for the dog.\"\n\n\"But I want to feed him myself, Pop. I want him to get used to me\nfeeding him.\"\n\n\"I'll give you your chance later.\"\n\nAfterwards, Sam thriftily opened an old can of a less expensive variety\nof proteinex and put half of it on a platter, which Mark carried outside\nthe ship. He moved off about a hundred yards in the direction the dog\nhad taken, and set the platter down on a rock.\n\n\"The wind is blowing the wrong way,\" said Sam. \"Let's wait a while.\"\n\n\n\nIn ten minutes the wind shifted, and if the dog was near, Sam felt\ncertain that he had picked up both their scent and that of the food.\nThat his feeling was correct was shown by the sudden appearance of the\nanimal, who barked again, but this time not so fiercely. And he stopped\nbarking to sniff hungrily, at the same time keeping his distance.\n\n\"Here, mutt,\" called Mark.\n\n\"I'm afraid he won't come any closer while we're around,\" said Sam. \"If\nyou want him to have that food, you'd better go away from it.\"\n\nMark reluctantly backed away with his father. The dog approached the\nfood, finally rushing down upon it as if he feared it would escape, and\ngobbled it.\n\nIn the days that followed, they continued to feed him, and the animal\nbecame relatively tame. He stopped barking at them, and at times let\nMark come within a few feet of him. But he never allowed Mark to come\nclose enough to touch him, and he was especially wary of Sam. The latter\ncould see, however, that there was nothing around the smooth-furred\nneck. The collar, if it had ever existed, had evidently been worn away.\n\n\"So we can't find out what his name is,\" said Mark in disappointment.\n\"Here, Prince, here, Spot, here, Rover--\"\n\nThe animal answered to none of the traditional dog names, nor to several\nof the newer ones that Mark recalled.\n\nAfter the dog had been with them for a half hour or so he usually\ntrotted off in the direction of what they had come to consider his\nlair.\n\n\"He doesn't seem to be getting tame enough for a pet,\" said Sam. \"That's\none idea I'm afraid you'll have to give up.\"\n\n\"All he needs is a little more time,\" said Mark. \"He's getting used to\nme.\" Then a sudden fear struck him, and he added, \"You're not going to\nleave here yet, are you, Pop? I thought you wanted to catch some big\nanimals.\"\n\n\"There aren't any other big animals,\" replied Sam. \"Just those small\nones who came apart in the traps, and they're not worth catching. But\nI'll stay. This place is as good as any other. I won't leave it yet.\"\n\n\n\nIn fact, the stay on the planet, bleak as the place was, seemed to be\nless unpleasant than cruising aimlessly through space. Mark had been\nstarved for companionship of someone besides his father, and in a way,\nwithout making too many demands, the dog was a companion. Wondering\nabout the beast and trying to tame him gave them something with which to\noccupy their minds. It had been several days, realized Sam, since he had\nlast snapped at Mark.\n\nIt had become quite certain now that there was no other human being\naround. The dog's eagerness for the food showed that no one else had\ntaken care of him for a long time. Evidently he had been forced to feed\nhimself on the small and elusive native animals which he could run down.\n\nOne of the things that puzzled Sam was the dog's obvious anxiety to\nleave the neighborhood of the ship after a short period and return to\nhis lair. And one day, driven by curiosity, Sam followed him, with Mark\ncoming along, too.\n\nThe dog had become sufficiently accustomed to them by now not to resent\ntheir presence, and it was easy to keep him in sight. He led the way for\nat least two miles, over rocky ground and past a small stream. Quite\nunexpectedly he stopped and began to whine and sniff the ground. As Sam\nand Mark approached, he turned on them, barking furiously.\n\nThe man and boy exchanged glances. \"He's acting just like he did in the\nbeginning,\" said Mark.\n\n\"There's something in the ground,\" said Sam. \"I'm going to find out what\nit is.\" And he drew his gun.\n\n\"You're not going to kill him, Pop!\"\n\n\"I'll just put him to sleep. An anaesthetic pellet of the kind I use for\ntrapping ought to do the trick.\"\n\nBut one pellet turned out to be not enough. It required the bursting of\nthree pellets before the animal finally trembled, came to a halt, and\nwith eyes glazed, fell over on the ground.\n\nWhen they approached closer, Sam caught sight of half a dozen stones,\nroughly piled together. He said, \"Better get back, Mark. This may not be\npleasant.\"\n\n\"You think--you think somebody's buried here?\"\n\n\"Very likely. I'm going to see.\"\n\n\n\nUsing a flat rock with a sharp edge as an improvised spade, he began to\ndig. The ground was hard, and the rock was not the best of tools. It\ntook him half an hour to reach the first bone, and another half-hour to\nuncover the rest.\n\nMark had come up behind him and was watching with no sign of revulsion.\nHe said, \"I--I was afraid there might be a body, Pop.\"\n\n\"So was I. It looks as if the man died so long ago that everything else\nhas rotted away, except for a few metal clasps. No other sign of shoes\nor clothes. And no indication of how this happened.\"\n\n\"You think he was the dog's master?\"\n\n\"Evidently.\"\n\nThey both stared at the sleeping animal. Then Sam shrugged, and began to\nfill the shallow grave again. Mark helped him push in the dirt and stamp\nit down into place. Finally they moved the stones back.\n\nThey were about to leave when Mark cried out, \"Look at that rock!\"\n\nStaring where his son pointed, Sam saw a gray column about four feet\nhigh, with four smooth lateral sides. Rectangular prisms of this size\nwere rare in nature. This was obviously the work of human hands, and of\na blasting rod as well, to judge by the sides, which showed evidence of\nhaving been fused before weathering had cut into them. At first he had\nthought the column was a gravestone. But there was no inscription upon\nit. There was nothing but a thin deep groove that ran horizontally\naround the four sides, several inches from the top.\n\n\"What does it mean, Pop?\"\n\n\"Let's find out. It's obviously been put here as some sort of memorial.\nAs for this groove--\"\n\nHe put his hands on the top of the stone and lifted. As he had half\nexpected, it separated at the horizontal groove. The top of the stone\nwas the lid of a box. Inside lay a plastic container.\n\n\"Some kind of plastic we don't make any more,\" muttered Sam.\n\n\"Aren't you going to open it?\" asked Mark eagerly. \"Maybe it tells about\nthe grave and the dog's name.\"\n\nThe plastic came open at a slight tug. Inside were several strong\nsheets of paper. Sam stared at them and said, \"It's writing, sure\nenough. But in some language I don't understand.\"\n\n\"We can put it in our mechanical translator,\" said Mark. \"That can tell\nus what it means.\"\n\n\"That's what we'll do.\"\n\n\"Aren't we going to take the dog with us, Pop?\"\n\n\"No, we'll leave him here. He'll come to in a little while.\"\n\n\n\nWalking back to their ship, Mark continued to show an excitement that\nwas unusual for him. \"You know what?\" he said. \"I'll bet we're going to\nlearn what the dog's name is.\"\n\n\"I doubt if whoever wrote this thing would bother about a trifle like\nthat.\"\n\n\"But that's important. You'll see, Pop, you'll see!\"\n\nAt the ship, Sam inserted the sheets into the reader section of his\ntranslator and started the motor. The selector swung into action.\n\n\"Before it can translate, it has to decide what language this is,\" he\nexplained.\n\n\"Will that take long?\"\n\n\"A few minutes if we're lucky, a couple of hours if we're not. After\nthat, I think the translation itself shouldn't take more than a few\nminutes. While we're waiting, we might as well eat.\"\n\n\"I'm not hungry,\" said Mark.\n\n\"You'd better eat anyway.\"\n\n\"Just a little bit, maybe. You know what I think, Pop? When I call the\ndog by his name, he'll know I'm his friend and he'll come to me. Then\nhe'll really be my pet.\"\n\n\"Don't count too much on it,\" said Sam. And thought once more how lonely\nhis son must be, to center so much hope in a half-wild beast.\n\nA light glowed suddenly in the translator. The selector had found the\nproper language. Now it began to translate.\n\nTwenty minutes later, its work had been completed. As Sam silently began\nto read, Mark bumped against him, knocking the translation from his\nhand. Sam's first reaction was anger at the boy's clumsiness. Then he\nbecame aware of the hope and the fear that lay behind Mark's excitement,\nand bit back the angry words which had almost reached his lips.\n\n\"Easy, Mark, easy,\" he said. He picked up the translation again and sat\ndown. \"You can read it over my shoulder, if you want to.\"\n\n\"I just want to find out the dog's name.\"\n\n\"The important thing is his master's name. Julian Hagstrom, it says. And\nhe was on a spaceship with his brother, Raoul.\"\n\nMark's eyes had skipped ahead. \"Look, Pop, here's the dog's name--Arkem!\nI never heard of a dog having a name like that! What does it mean?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" muttered Sam absently, still reading.\n\nBut Mark wasn't actually interested in his answer. He ran outside.\n\"Arkem!\" he called. \"Arkem!\"\n\nThere was nothing he could interpret as an answer. After a moment or two\nhe came into the ship again, his face betraying his disappointment. \"I\nguess he doesn't hear me. He's too far away.\"\n\nSam nodded. He had put the translation down and was staring straight\nahead of him, as if looking through the ship's side.\n\n\"Is anything the matter, Pop?\"\n\n\"What? Oh, no, nothing's the matter. I was just thinking about what I\nread here.\"\n\n\"They had an accident, didn't they? How did it happen?\"\n\n\n\n\"It happened because their ship wasn't as good as ours. Julian Hagstrom,\nthe man who was killed, was buried here by his brother. Raoul put this\nrecord in the stone to mark his grave. I think he also engraved\nsomething on the stone itself. But that's been worn away.\"\n\n\"It must have been a long time ago. Maybe years.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was years ago. After he buried Julian, Raoul tried to make\nrepairs, and headed in a direction where he hoped he'd find a civilized\nplanet. He never made it.\"\n\n\"How can you know that? He wrote the paper _before_ he started out.\"\n\n\"If he had made it, we'd have heard of him. We'd certainly have heard of\nhim.\" Sam's face was bleak. \"And Rhoda--your mother--would still be\nalive.\"\n\nMark looked puzzled, and stared at the translation once more. \"It says\nhere he tried to re-reverse the aging process. What does that mean? And\nwhat's immortality, Pop?\"\n\n\"Something he and his brother were looking for. Something to keep people\nfrom ever dying. They had a ship full of dogs and other animals. All\ndied in their experiments--all but Arkem. They had high hopes of Arkem.\nHe lived through a number of different treatments and became quite a pet\nof Julian's. Then came the crash. Their method wasn't proof against\naccidental death, and at any rate they hadn't applied it yet to\nthemselves.\n\n\"After Raoul buried his brother, the dog was miserable, and howled so\nmuch that Raoul decided to leave him behind. He was helped to reach this\ndecision by the fact that the ship had lost much of its air in the\naccident, and he knew that the air-purifying mechanism wasn't working\ntoo well. He figured he'd have a better chance of surviving if he stayed\nin the ship alone. But it didn't do him any good. He was lost in space,\nor we'd certainly have heard of him.\"\n\nFrom outside there came the sound of a low growl. \"It's Arkem!\" cried\nMark. \"Now you'll see. Wait till he hears me call his name.\"\n\nHe ran out, and Sam followed slowly. \"Don't expect too much, Mark,\" he\nsaid, almost with pity.\n\nMark didn't hear him. \"Arkem!\" he called. \"Arkem! Arkem!\"\n\nThe dog was watchful, keeping his distance and giving no sign of\nrecognition. Sam put his arm around his son's shoulder.\n\n\"Arkem, Arkem! Here, Arkem!\"\n\nThe dog snarled.\n\n\n\nThere were tears in the boy's eyes. \"He doesn't know his own name! He\ndoesn't even know his own name! Arkem!\"\n\n\"It's no use, Mark, he's forgotten he ever had a name. I'm afraid you'd\nbetter give up the idea of having him as a pet.\"\n\n\"But you _can't_ forget your own name!\"\n\n\"You can in eight hundred years. Yes, Mark, that's when all this\nhappened, eight hundred years ago. That's why the language had to be\ntranslated. Arkem is immortal. And during his long life he's forgotten\nnot only his name, but the master for whose sake he was marooned here.\nIf Julian Hagstrom were, by some miracle, to come back to life, I'm sure\nthe dog wouldn't remember him. All he has is a vague but strong tie to\nthat heap of stones. He no longer knows why he's protecting it. He's\nbeen away from live human beings so long that his brain is little more\nthan a bundle of reflexes and instincts.\"\n\n\"I'll train him,\" said Mark. \"Sometimes you forget a thing at first, but\nit comes back to you later. He'll remember his name--here, Arkem!\"\n\n\"It's no use,\" said Sam. \"For eight hundred years he's been tied to that\nheap of stones. He'll never remember anything except that fact. I'll get\nyou another dog for a pet.\"\n\n\"You mean we're going back to Mars or Earth?\"\n\n\"Some place like that. Some place where there are people. Being alone in\nspace is no good for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Pop, you can't get rid of me like that.\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to get rid of you,\" said Sam. \"Being alone in space is\nno good for me either. I'm going with you.\"\n\n\"Gee, are you sure? You won't change your mind?\"\n\nThe delighted but uncertain look on his son's face shook Sam. He said\ncarefully, \"I won't change my mind. I've decided that it's possible to\nhave too much of a good thing. If grief is a good thing.\"\n\nSuddenly, for no reason that they could detect, the dog barked at them\nand backed away, the fur rising in an angry ridge along his back.\n\n\"Couldn't we take him along anyway?\" asked Mark. \"I don't like to think\nof him all alone here, year after year.\"\n\n\"He'll be miserable here, but he'd be more miserable away from his heap\nof dirt and stones. Perhaps--\" Mark didn't see as Sam pulled his gun,\nthen let it slip back into place. \"No. That's none of my business. Maybe\nhe'll be fortunate and have an accident.\"\n\n\"What did you say, Pop?\"\n\n\"Nothing much. Come along, Mark. We're heading for civilization.\"\n\nAn hour later, the ship rose into the air. Through the blasting of the\nrockets, Sam thought--imagined, he decided, was a better word--that he\nheard the long doleful whine of a creature whose mindless grief was\ndoomed to last for all eternity.\n\n                                                    --WILLIAM MORRISON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
