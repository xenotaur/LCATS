    "body": "Pay day! I scrawled my Larry Maloney across the back of the check and\nhanded it to Nick, the bartender. \"Leave me something to operate on,\"\nI told him.\n\nNick turned it over. \"Still with the _News_?\"\n\nThe question was rhetorical. I let it pass without swinging at it. I\nwas mentally estimating the total of the pile of tabs Nick pulled out\nof the cash register, like a fighter on percentage trying to count the\nhouse. I didn't like the figure it gave me.\n\nNick added them up, then added them again before he pulled some bills\nout of the money drawer and said, \"Here's thirty skins. Your rent\ndue?\"\n\n\"This'll cover it. I'll do my drinking here.\"\n\nI went over to a booth and sat down. I lit a cigarette. I smoked. And\nwaited. Presently Sherry, tall, dark and delicious, decided I was\nmaking like a customer, and strolled over. \"Would you like a menu, Mr.\nMaloney?\" she trilled.\n\n\"Larry to you,\" I reminded her. \"No menu. Bring me a steak. Big.\nThick. Rare. And a plate of french fries. No salad. Bread and butter.\nCoffee.\"\n\nShe managed at last to pull her writing hand out of mine, and I had to\nrepeat the order. Unless it could be turned into money, Sherry's\nmemory was limited strictly to the present instant.\n\nShe put in the order, then brought me a set-up. I let my eyes go over\nher, real careful, for maybe the thousandth time. No doubt of it--the\nlassie had a classy chassis. If she just wouldn't yak so damn much.\n\n\"Did you see the matches last night?\" She didn't wait for my answer,\njust went on with the yat-a-ta. \"I spent the whole evening just glued\nto my television set. I was simply enthralled. When the Horrible\nHungarian got the Flying Hackensack on--\"\n\n\"Standing Hackenschmidt, Sherry!\"\n\n\"--poor little Billie McElroy I wanted to--to scratch his eyes out.\"\n\nI pointed out that McElroy weighed in at two forty-one and had gone on\nto win the match. Sherry never heard me.\n\n\"And the way the Weeping Greek kept hitting the other fellow--the\nannouncer said he was throwing Judo cutlets.\"\n\n\"_Cuts_, not cutlets.\"\n\n\"But aren't Judo cutlets illegitimate?\" The barest hint of a puzzled\nfrown tugged at her flawless brows as she poured ice water into my\nglass.\n\n\"The word,\" I repeated, \"is _cuts_. And the blow is not illegal.\" I\ngave my eyes another treat. What a chassis. And _what_ a mind.\n\"Anything these days, so long as you don't kill your opponent, is\nlegal in wrestling.\"\n\nSuddenly we had company: a little man who made scarcely a sound as he\nslid into my booth and sat facing me. \"Rassling, yet,\" he said, in\nbitter tones. \"What a woid. Dun't be saying it.\" He helped himself to\na cigarette from my pack lying on the table, and put the pack in his\npocket. He lit the cigarette, using my lighter, which he held a moment\nlonger than necessary before replacing it--regretfully--on the table.\n\nHe inhaled deeply. \"Rassling!\" he repeated. \"Leave us not discuss it.\"\n\n\n\nHe was thin, haggard, unkempt, and his brown suit--in which the chalk\nstripes were beginning to blend with the background--was threadbare.\nHe needed a shave, and his fingernails were dirty. He was vaguely\nfamiliar. The beady little eyes flicked up at me, and all uncertainty\ndissolved.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" I said. \"Not you. Not--\"\n\nHe exhaled a great cloud of smoke. \"Hoiman Katz,\" he said, in dejected\ntones. \"It is me, again. The same as like always, only not so better.\"\nHe sighed.\n\nSherry's tongue had been shifting from one foot to the other, waiting\nfor an opening. \"Are you a wrestler, Mr. Katz?\" she asked brightly.\n\nHoiman half rose from his seat, and the cigarette dropped from his lax\nmouth. Then he slumped down again, spread his hands, shrugged, and\nsaid, \"Now I esk you!\"\n\nSherry said, \"I guess not.\" Then, \"Shall I bring you something?\" Her\neyes were on me as she asked. She hadn't worked on Vine Street for six\nyears without learning the ropes--about people at least.\n\nI nodded.\n\nKatz was waiting for the nod. He licked his lips. \"I'll have a--\"\n\n\"Planet Punch?\"\n\n\"No. I'll have a--\"\n\n\"Solar Sling? Martian Mule?\"\n\nHoiman's eyes squinted shut, and he winced eloquently. \"Martian!\" he\ngroaned. \"With rassling, too! Bring me a bottle of beer. Two bottles!\"\nAfter a moment he peered cautiously through slitted lids. \"Is she\ngone?\" he whispered. \"Such woids. Rassling. Martian. Better I should\nhave stood in Hollywood.\"\n\nI laughed. \"What's the matter with wrestling, Hoiman? Last I heard you\nwere managing a good boy--what was his name?\"\n\n\"Killer Coogan? That bum!\"\n\nI had to do some thinking back. \"Yeah,\" I said, \"that's the boy.\nStarted wrestling back in the fifties. Good crowd pleaser. Took the\nJunior Heavyweight Championship from Brickbuster Bates. Had a trick\nhold he called the pretzel bend--hard to apply, but good for a\nsubmission every time when he clamped it on. Right?\"\n\n\"Okay, so he won some bouts with it. But that was twenty-five years\nago. He's slower, can't use that holt any more. We ain't had no main\nevents for a long time, and my bum is a big eater, see?\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So Hoiman Katz is not sleeping yet at the switch. He's got it up\nhere.\" A grimy forefinger tapped his wrinkled brow. \"I says, Hoiman,\nif we don't get it here, we gotta go where we _can_ get it.\"\n\nSherry came back with Hoiman's two bottles of beer, and my steak and\nfrench fries. The steak was a dream, and the french fries were a\ncrisp, rich golden brown that started my mouth watering.\n\nSherry wanted to talk. I waved her down, and she went away pouting. If\nthere was a story in Hoiman I wanted to get it without interference.\n\nHe was pouring a second glass of beer. His beady eyes swivelled up to\nmine, then quickly away. \"You want I should tell you about my bum?\"\n\nI mumbled something through a mouthful of good juicy steak.\n\nHoiman sighed, reminiscently, and a grimy paw swooped into my french\nfries. I moved them to the other side of my steak platter.\n\nWe woiked all up and down the Coast, (Hoiman said). My bum took all\ncomers. Slasher Slade had his abominal stretch. Crusher Kane had his\nrolling rocking horse split; Manslaughter Murphy had his cobra\nholt--but none of those guys had anything like my Bum's pretzel bend.\nHe trun 'em all, and they stayed trun.\n\nThat was fine. All through the fifties, and the sixties we made plenty\nscratch. Maybe it slowed down, but we was eating regular. In the\nseventies my bum was slowing up. I shoulda seen it when he started\nmissing his holt. That leaves him wide open, see? And twict the other\nbum moiders him.\n\nThat was recent--they was just putting in regular passenger service on\nthe space lines, so you could buy tickets to the Moon, or Venus or\nMars. Depended on whether you was ducking a bill or some broad.\n\nBy this time my bum is getting pinned to the mat too regular, and\nwe're slipping out of the big dough. I counts up our lettuce one day,\nand I says to my bum, I says, Ray, I says, you and me are going to the\nMoon.\n\nSo what if they didn't have a rassling circuit there yet, I tell him.\nJust leave it to your uncle Hoiman. We'll make our own circuit.\n\nI figured that the ribbon clerks wouldn't be taking space rides for\nawhile, and if we went to the Moon we'd find some bums there who could\ngive my bum a good bout, but not fast enough to toss him.\n\nSo we went there.\n\n\nHoiman's eyes, looking into the past, had lost their beadiness. He'd\nshifted his third glass of beer to his right hand, and his left,\nseemingly of its own volition, had found my plate of french fries. The\npile had dwindled by half, and tell-tale potato crumbs were lodged in\nthe whiskers on Hoiman's unshaven chin. Neither beer nor potatoes in\nhis mouth seemed to matter--he went right on talking at the same rate.\n\n\nIt takes me two weeks, (Hoiman continued), to ballyhoo up a bout, line\nup another bum, fix up the ring and hall and everything. We was down\nto our last lettuce that night. I gets my bum by the ear, and I tells\nhim, I says, make it a good show. But don't take no chances--this is\nwinner take all, and we better not lose. Don't use your pretzel bend\nunlessen you have to.\n\nThis bum we rassle was a big miner, see?--hard as the rocks he juggles\naround in the daytime. He was stronger'n my bum, but he don't know\nnothing about rassling. My bum tried a step-over toehold on him, but\nhe knows how to kick. My bum goes through the ropes. He don't try that\nno more.\n\nThey rassle around, and eight minutes later my bum takes first fall\nwith a body press after flattening the miner with a hard knee lift. I\ntold my bum to let him take the second fall, which he does. The big\nminer gets a head scissors on him and like to moiders him before he\ncan submit.\n\nRay isn't liking it, and he takes the third one quick with a abominal\nstretch, which surprises the big guy and takes all the fight outa him.\nHe didn't know they was holts like that, and he passes the word around\nthat my bum has plenty moxie. So we get only one more bout on the\nMoon--but outa the two we get enough scratch to take us to Venus.\n\n\nHoiman paused, trying hard to pour more beer out of the empty second\nbottle. He licked his lips like they were real dry, and his beady eyes\nflicked a glance at me that came and went as fast as the tip of a\nswinging rapier. I signalled Sherry to bring two more bottles of beer.\nHoiman relaxed, sighed, gazing almost affectionately at the new crop\nof french fries which had appeared suddenly in his clutching fist.\n\nSherry, still pouting, came with the beer, and ten seconds later\nHoiman was talking again.\n\nWe did okay on Venus, (he said). Before long I have a regular little\ncircuit woiked up in the three spaceports, and they is plenty bums\nthere what think they can rassle. Some of them can--my bum has to use\nhis pretzel bend oftener and oftener. He's lucky, and he don't slip\nnone clamping it on--at first.\n\nI have ta tell you about them Venusians. Them dustlanders, I mean.\nThey got big flat wide feet for padding through the dust, and their\nnoses are like a big spongy thing all over their puss, to filter the\ndust out. So they got no expression on their pans. A guy like me,\nwhich has got a real expressive face, could get the willies just\nlooking at them. And their eyes--round and flat, big as silver\ndollars.\n\nThem dustlanders was nuts about rassling. They flock to the rassling\nshows and buy good seats. They don't do no hollering and waving like\npeople do. Just sit there, staring out of them big flat eyes and\nmaking funny _chuffing_ noises at each other when some bum would get a\ngood hold on the other.\n\nMy bum didn't pay them no never mind at foist, but one day he tells me\nhe keeps feeling them eyes on him while he's rasslin'. I give him the\nold razz--but that night he tries for his pretzel bend, and misses.\nThe other bum is young and fast, and my bum gets trun, but good!\n\nSo this happens a few more times, and my bum says we gotta move on--he\ncan't rassle no more with them dustlanders staring at him and\n_chuffing_ about him.\n\nSome of them ear benders on Venus are studying up on the side, anyhow,\nand the outlook for my bum ain't so good no more nohow. So we go to\nMars.\n\n\nI signalled Sherry for my coffee, as Hoiman ground to a stop while he\nrefilled his glass. I swear my eyes weren't away from the table for\nmore than a half second, but in that moment all the french fries left\nmy plate. I yielded to Fate--it wasn't meant to be that I eat french\nfries this pay day.\n\n\nThings are primitive like on Mars, (Hoiman was saying), on accounta\nthe troubles they have with power there. We rassled under some funny\nset-ups, but that's okay with me as long as my bum tosses his man.\n\nThis time they ain't none of them screwy Venusians to put the whammy\non him, and he's doing okay. Until--I gotta admit it--I get deluges of\ngrandeur, or something.\n\nI gotta tell ya about them Martians. They are about seven feet tall,\nnot too heavy, but they got plenty moxie. And an extra pair of arms,\nso I get to thinking they oughta be terrific in the ring. Just so they\nain't _too_ terrific.\n\nI ask my bum, I says to him, I says, could he, does he think, trun one\nof them Martians? He says iffen he has to he'll use his pretzel bend,\nand they ain't no Martian on six legs, or eight, what won't say uncle.\n\nSo I check with the Colony Administrator, and he says it's okay for a\nmatch perviding we don't interfere with any of their beliefs or\ncustoms or conventions. I ast him what were they, and he told me the\nMartians never talked about them, so we'd just have to be careful.\n\nWhat the hell, I says to my bum. A bout's a bout. So I start\npromoting. First I find out do them Martians have a bum what wants to\nrassle my bum, winner take all--which is the way we like to rassle,\nwhen I know my bum can trun the other bum. Natch.\n\nI don't mean we talk to the Martians--I don't savvy them squeaks they\nuse on each other. We hire an interpreter--we have to take his word\nfor it that everything is woiking out.\n\nSo the night of the match comes around and them Martians insist on\nhaving it in their own town, Meekweek it sounds like, near as I can\nsay it in people talk. Remember I told you it was primitive? You never\nseen nothing like this. They don't live with people by the way. They\nlive off by theirselves in their own town.\n\nThe ring and mat and ropes are okay--not regulation, but nothing to\nsquawk about. Them lights was what get me. The Martians got no power,\nso they make a deal with some insecks. Cross my heart--'sa fack. You\nnever see such insecks. Round, big as a dinner plate, flat on top,\nrounded off on the bottom. They stay up in the air by spinning like a\nwheel--just like them flying saucers the Rigellians was spying on us\nin the fifties. You wouldn't remember about that.\n\nAt night the bottom part of them insecks lights up like a big electric\nbulb, almost as bright, too. They was enough of them _zinging_ around\nover the ring to make it look like it was floodlighted. My bum says\nthey remind him of them dish-eyed Venusians, but I quick change the\nsubjeck. That shoulda tipped me off--shoulda give me a freemonition\nthat the party was gonna get rough. If I'da known how rough, we'da\nstood in town.\n\nThe Martian bum is a big mug, and those four arms of his look mighty\nplural. I quick tells my bum, I says to him, I says, watch out for arm\nlocks and leg strangles. If that overgrowed spider ever gets one on\nyou he'll double keylock it!\n\n\n\nThe two bums go in the ring, and get their instructions. Mostly the\nref makes motions. The Martian nods his head like he understands fine.\nWhen the ref is telling them about trunnin' each other outen the ring,\nthe Martian makes a motion like can he trun his man up in the rafters?\n\nThe ref shakes his head no, and that seems to satisfy the Martian. The\ntimekeeper blows a whistle, and things start to moving. That Martian\nMangler puts down his two middle limbs, uses them like legs, and is\nacross the ring and swarming all over my bum while he is still taking\nhis foist step.\n\nBefore you know it the ref is counting one, two, three, and my bum is\ntrun for the foist fall. The Martian is using his middle limbs like\narms, and he has a hammerlock and an arm strangle both on my bum--and\nboth of them keylocked!\n\nThe ref gets them untangled, and I quick tell my bum we ain't hurt\nuntil we get trun twict. So I tell him how to get that next fall--to\nkeep away from them four arms and keep circling until he gets a chance\nto clamp on the pretzel bend.\n\nThe whistle blows, and this time my bum uses my head. When the Martian\nMangler gallops over to his corner, my bum has went through the ropes\nand quick runs around on the apron to the other side and comes at the\nMartian from behind before the goof knows what's happening.\n\nHe lets the Martian have a rabbit punch, then a forearm smash, then a\nknee to his stomach. The Martian leans over, kinda sick, maybe, and\ngets a knee lift to the smoosh. This softens him up good, and my bum\nclamps the pretzel bend on him. That Martian squirms like an octopus,\nwith arms and legs flying in all directions. And you coulda knocked me\nover with a subpoena when he got out of it!\n\nYour guess is as good as mine, how he done it. But my bum is moving\nfast, and he gives him some more knee lifts and a drop kick or two,\nand then a hair mare, and he falls on him for a body press and gets\nthe count.\n\nEach bum has got a fall. You shoulda heard them Martians there\nsqueaking this time--ten times as loud as when their bum won the foist\nfall. But they had no squawks. These flying chandeliers they had, they\nkinda bunched up to follow the action, and the light was good so the\nref couldn't make no mistake about it.\n\nThat Martian squirming out of the pretzel bend don't look so good, so\nI tell my bum not to use it for the thoid fall. I tell him to give the\nMartian some more of them knee lifts--he don't get along with them at\nall. I tell him to folly that up with a airplane spin and a body slam.\n\nMy bum follys instructions to the alphabet, and that is just what\nhappens. He bangs that Martian around with elbow smashes and knee\nlifts till he don't know is he on one leg or six. Then he goes in fast\nand grabs him by a coupla legs and arms, holds him up in the air, and\nspins him like a pinwheel.\n\nRight away I knowed something was in the air besides that Martian\nMangler. Oi! Did things happen all to onct!\n\nMy bum slams the Martian and falls on him for the count, and wins the\nthoid fall and the match. That part is okay. But while the Martian is\nstill up in the air I notice that all the squeaking from the Martians\nhas stopped all of a sudden.\n\nSo from the Martians we are getting nothing but silence, strictly\nwholesale. I think maybe that's natural when their bum gets trun.\n\nAnd then--plop! plop! plop!--and them flying light bulbs all drop down\nflat on the mat and lay there just like the Martian bum, until they\nisn't enough light in the house to see to strike a match. And then the\nsqueaking starts again, like a million hungry rats, and I can just\nbarely see them Martians starting for the ring.\n\nI gets my bum by the arm and tells him something tells me we better\nblow the joint. We blow, fast. Them Martians is mad about something\nwhich I ain't had time to figure out, yet. My bum steps on one of them\nanimated light fixtures when he gets out of the ring and squashes it.\nA puddle of light squirts out, and natch he steps in it. We are\nscramming through that crowd like mad, and we are in the clear. But we\nhear them squeaks behind us for a long time. They are follyin' the\nglowing footprints my bum is leaving to point the way.\n\n\nHe emptied the last bottle of beer, holding it upended for a long time\nwaiting for the final laggard drop to detach itself. He stalled over\nhis drink, waiting for me to ask him what happened, so I did. He put\non his most wounded expression, and I knew then that he'd suffered a\nmortal blow--to his purse.\n\n\nYeah, we got away, I made my bum trun away his flashy shoes so they\ncouldn't track us by them. We walked all the way back to Neopolis, the\npeople city. All kinds of plain and fancy rumors beat us there, so the\nColony Cops put us in protective custody until they got the straight\nstory.\n\nNobody ever saw another Martian. It seems that they got some trick\nnotions about theirselves. They are proud because they can walk on the\nground and don't have to fly, so they got a hearty contemp for things\nthat fly, like them insecks which they used for house lights.\n\nNow, them insecks is dopes too and would give anything if they could\nwalk like the Martians. And the Martians know the insecks can think a\nlittle, and it makes them feel good to have the insecks looking up to\nthem. Lord knows nobody else does.\n\nSo when my bum lifted their bum up in the air and spun him around like\na pinwheel it was a big insult to them. They took it that my bum was\nas much as telling them that he didn't think they was any better than\nthem insecks flying around over the ring. And the insecks took it as a\ninvite to come down and try the Martians racket so that's why they all\nflop into the ring and the lights go out. They was trying to walk.\n\nThat's more than the Martians can take. They swarm into the ring and\nkill all the insecks. They'da killed us too, but I got smart brains\nand we didn't hang around asking for it.\n\nAnd now they won't have nothing to do with no people from Earth on\naccount of they have lost so much smoosh, the way they look at it.\n\nWe got no take from that bout. And the Colony Administrator lifts all\nour scratch--said we'd gummed up Martian trade and he'da trun us in\nthe clink too only he didn't want to see no more of us. He wouldn'ta\neven give us fare back to Earth except he said he didn't want us\nanywhere on Mars.\n\n\n\"So that,\" the little promoter concluded sadly, \"is why I don't like\nMars and rasslin' and Martian Mules and people who talk about such\nthings.\" His beady eyes flicked a baleful glance at Sherry, who\nhovered nearby on the chance that he'd stop talking and give her an\ninning.\n\nHoiman stood up, carefully shook the bottles to be sure that they were\nempty, extracted a cigarette from the pack he'd stuck into his pocket,\nand used my lighter again. He hefted it carefully, reluctantly putting\nit back on the table. Then his little black eyes swivelled to the last\npiece of potato on my plate--the piece he'd spared in previous raids.\n\n\"What's the matter with them fries?\" he asked.\n\nIt disappeared into his mouth and he went away, munching, a dingy\nlittle man padding along on silent, predatory feet.\n\nHe'd scarcely slipped out through the door when Sherry moved in.\n\n\"Is he really a wrestler, Larry?\" she asked breathlessly.\n\n\"Him?\" Even Sherry, vintage Vine Streeter that she was, should have\ngot the pitch. \"The only thing,\" I told her solemnly, \"that Hoiman\never got a hammerlock on was a dollar bill!\"\n\nBut Sherry wasn't listening, \"Don't you just _love_ wrestling?\"\n\nI let my eyes have a treat, taking their time as they went over that\nclassy chassis. Then I said it. Fervently.\n\n\"Any time, Sherry! Any time.\"\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
