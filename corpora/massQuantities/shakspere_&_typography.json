    "body": "_The_ INTRODUCTION\n\n\nIn the good old days when printing was better recognized as a mystery than\nas an art, one could call a printer 'a man of letters' without being\nguilty of a pun. Books were for the few then, and the man who would print\nthem must be somewhat of a scholar himself.\n\nTo-day, amid the whirr of many presses, and the hurrying to and fro of the\nprinting office, the printer finds little or no time for literary\npursuits, despite the fact that printing is, in very truth, the handmaid\nof literature. It is the more admirable, therefore, when a successful\nprinter attains to a degree of scholarship--particularly scholarship in\nmatters that enlighten and dignify his own handicraft.\n\nSuch a printer was _William Blades_. During fifty years of active\nbusiness life he contributed to the history of printing, a goodly number\nof books and a mass of miscellaneous articles. Among these is the most\ncomplete and authoritative life of Caxton, England's first printer,\nrepresenting an immense amount of study and research.\n\nThe book from which the following pages are reprinted is perhaps the least\nfamiliar of Blades' works, and it evidently was written as a literary\nrecreation. The thought that reading it may afford recreation to those\nbusied about the making of books, and the comparative scarcity of the only\nedition, are the excuses for reprinting the more interesting portion.\n\nThe first chapter (merely a resum\u00e9 of the theories that have been advanced\nby various professions and callings to claim Shakspere for their own) has\nbeen omitted; likewise the appendix, which is a suggestion that many of\nthe obscurities in the text of Shakspere may be cleared up by a study of\nthe typographical errors in the first editions. With these exceptions, the\nwork is given here entire, and, it is hoped, in such form as accords with\nthe spirit of the author, whose tastes were those of the scholarly\nprinter.\n\n  _Editorial Dept.\n  The Winthrop Press,\n  32 Lafayette Place, N. Y.\n  November, 1897_\n\n\n\n\n_The PREFACE_\n\n\n_The First Chapter of this Tractate is designed to show, in a succinct\nmanner, the numerous and contradictory theories concerning Shakspere's\nspecial knowledge, the evidence for which has been created by 'selecting'\ncertain words and phrases from the mass of his writings._\n\n_The Second and Third Chapters, erected on a similar basis of 'selection',\nare intended to prove that Shakspere had an intimate and special knowledge\nof Typography._\n\n_Old Printers can still call to mind that period of our history when a\nstalwart Pressman, on his way to work, ran considerable risk in the\nstreets of London of being seized by another kind of pressmen, viz., the\nPress-gang, and forced_ nolens volens _into the service of the King. Some\nreaders (not Printers) may think that I have exercised over quotations\nfrom Shakspere's works a similar compulsion, by pressing into my service\npassages whose bearing is by no means in a typographical direction. They\nmay even go so far as to strain somewhat the self-accusation of Falstaff\n(Henry IV, iv, 2), and bring against me the charge that_\n\n    _I have misused the King's press most damnably, by printing such\n    evidences._\n\n_I can only reply that if, notwithstanding a careful consideration of the\nproofs here laid before him, the reader should consider my case 'not\nproven', I must submit with all humility to his penetration and judgment._\n\n_At the same time, since my proofs that Shakspere was a Printer are at\nleast quite as conclusive as the evidence brought forward by others to\ndemonstrate that he was Doctor, Lawyer, Soldier, Sailor, Catholic,\nAtheist, Thief, I would claim as a right that my opponent, having rejected\nmy theory that he was a Printer, should be consistent, and at once, reject\nall theories which attribute to him special knowledge, and repose upon the\nsimple belief that Shakspere, the Actor and Playwright, was a man of\nsurpassing genius, of keen observation, and never-failing memory._\n\nW. B.\n\n\n\n\nI. SHAKSPERE IN THE PRINTING OFFICE\n\n\nIn November, 1589, the company acting at the Blackfriars Theatre thought\nit would be advantageous to their interests to send in to the Privy\nCouncil a memorial, certifying that they had never given cause of\ndispleasure by introducing upon the stage 'matters of State or Religion'.\nThe actors who signed this memorial styled themselves 'Her Majesty's Poor\nPlayers', and among them appears the name of William Shakspere. We here\nmeet the Poet's name for the first time after he had left his home at\nStratford-on-Avon, about four years previously. What his employment had\nbeen in the intervening period is a question which few of his biographers\nhave cared to ask, and which not one has answered.\n\nIt is usually supposed that immediately upon his arrival in London he\nbecame in some way associated with the Stage,--but there is no evidence of\nthis. On the contrary, we shall give reasons for believing that coming to\nLondon poor, needy, and in search of employment, he was immediately taken\ninto the service of Vautrollier the Printer.\n\nTHOMAS VAUTROLLIER, entitled in his patents 'typographus Londinensis, in\nclaustro vulgo Blackfriers commorans', was a Frenchman who came to England\nat the commencement of Queen Elizabeth's reign. He was admitted a brother\nof the Stationers' Company in 1564, and commenced business as Printer and\nPublisher in Blackfriars, working in the same premises up to the time of\nhis death, which occurred in 1588. His character as a scholar stands high,\nand his workmanship is excellent. He had a privilege, or monopoly, for the\nprinting and sale of certain books, as all the chief Printers then had.\nShortly before his death he married his daughter to Richard Field, who for\nthis reason, and because he succeeded to the premises and business of the\nwidow, is erroneously supposed by Ames to have served his apprenticeship\nto Vautrollier. But why bring in the name of Richard Field? The reply is\nimportant. Field was Shakspere's own townsman, and being of about the same\nage and social rank, the boys probably grew up together as playfellows.\nField's father, Henry Field, was a Tanner at Stratford-on-Avon, and\nHalliwell says 'a friend of Shakspere's family'. Early in 1578 young Field\ncame up to London, and at Michaelmas was apprenticed for seven years to\nGeorge Bishop, Printer and Publisher. Being in the same trade as\nVautrollier, Field would naturally become acquainted with him; and in\n1588, a year after he was out of his time, he married Vautrollier's\ndaughter. Here, then, we seem to have a missing link supplied in the chain\nof Shakspere's history. In 1585 Shakspere came up to London in a 'needy'\nstate. To whom would he be more likely to apply than to his old playmate\nRichard Field. Field, a young man nearly out of his apprenticeship, on\nterms of intimacy with Vautrollier, could do nothing better than recommend\nhim to the father of his future wife. Once introduced we may be sure that\nShakspere, with his fund of wit and good humour, would always be a welcome\nguest; and that this friendly feeling was maintained between him and the\nVautrollier-Field families receives confirmation from the fact that\nRichard Field, who succeeded to the shop and business soon after the death\nof his father-in-law, actually put to press the two first printed works of\nthe great Poet, the 'Venus and Adonis', 1593, and the 'Lucrece', 1594.\n\nHere then, in Vautrollier's employ, perhaps as a Press-reader, perhaps as\nan Assistant in the shop, perchance as both, we imagine Shakspere to have\nspent about three years upon his first arrival in the metropolis. Placed\nthus in Blackfriars, close to the Theatre, close to the Taverns, close to\nthe Inns of Court, and in what was then a fashionable neighbourhood,\nShakspere enjoyed excellent opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of men\nand manners.\n\nField did not succeed Vautrollier immediately upon his death. His widow\nendeavoured for some time to carry on the business alone; but for some\nunknown reason the Stationers' Company withheld their license; and after a\nfruitless effort to obtain it, she was succeeded by her son-in-law. These\nbusiness changes would probably be the occasion of which Shakspere eagerly\navailed himself to join the Players at the neighbouring theatre.\n\nThe Sonnets, although not printed until 1609, are generally acknowledged\nto be among Shakspere's earliest efforts, and we cannot help imagining\nthat Sonnet XXIV was written while in the employment of Vautrollier; or\nat any rate, while the shop, hung round with prints, was fresh in the\nPoet's memory. May be some of their warmth was inspired by the charms of\nthe buxom widow herself who was apostrophised by the Poet when wishing her\n\n    To find where your true image _pictured_ lies,\n    Which in my bosom's _shop_ is hanging still,\n    That hath his _windows_ glazed with thine eyes.\n                                _Sonnet_ xxiv.\n\nAt any rate, we have here in three lines as many metaphors, and all\nderived from just such employment as we suppose Shakspere at that time to\nhave been engaged in.\n\nThen, again, to a Printer's widow, not over young, what more telling than\nthe following reference?\n\n    Or what strong hand can hold Time's swift foot back?\n    Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\n    O, none, unless this miracle have might,\n    That in _black ink_ my love may still shine bright.\n                                _Sonnet_ lxvi.\n\nNote here, that the jet black ink which everybody admires in old\nmanuscripts was much too thick for a running hand, and had long been\nsuperseded by a writing fluid which, in the 16th century, was far from\nequalling the bright gloss of Printing Ink.\n\nBefore turning to the internal evidence supplied by Shakspere's writings\nin support of our theory, let us glance at the list of works printed and\npublished by Vautrollier, and see if Shakspere reflected any trace of\ntheir influence upon his mind.\n\nFrom Herbert's 'Typographical Antiquities' we find that in the 'Shop'\nwould be the two following works:\n\n    _A brief Introduction to Music. Collected by P. Delamote, a Frenchman;\n    Licensed._\n\n        _London_, 8vo., 1574.\n\n    _Discursus Cantiones; qu\u00e6 ab argumento sacr\u00e6 vocantur, quinque et sex\n    partivm. Autoribus Thoma Tallisio et Guilielmo Birdo. Cum Privilegio._\n\n        _London_, oblong quarto, 1575.\n\nDelamote's Introduction, as well as the Sacred Songs by Tallis and Bird,\nwere Vautrollier's copyright, and we have already seen how intimate an\nacquaintance Shakspere had with music. Might not the above works have been\nthe mine from which he obtained his knowledge?\n\nOf religious works, Vautrollier printed and published several, all in\naccordance with the principles of the great Reformation, and the writer\nwho argued that from his intimate knowledge of the tenets of Calvin,\nShakspere must have been himself a Calvinist, would have found sufficient\nexplanation of his special knowledge in the following books from\nVautrollier's press:\n\n    _The Neu Testament, with diversities of Reading and profitable\n    annotations. An epistle by J. Calvin, prefixed._\n\n        4to., 1575:\n\n    _Institutio Christian\u00e6 Religionis, Joanne Caluino author\u00e8._\n\n        8vo., _London_, 1576: and\n\n    _The Institution of Christian Religion_ [not in Herbert's Ames]\n    _written in Latine, by Mr. John Calvine, and translated into English\n    by Thomas Norton. Imprinted at London, by Thomas Vautrollier._\n\n        8vo., 1578.\n\nThis last contains an Epistle to the Reader by John Calvin, as well as an\naddress headed _Typographus Lectori_. Of each of the above works several\neditions were published.\n\nIn one of his pedantic speeches Holofernes exclaims:\n\n            Venetia! Venetia!\n            Chi non te vede non ti pretia.\n    Old Mantuan! Old Mantuan! who understandeth thee not, loveth thee not.\n                                _Love's Labour Lost_, iv, 2.\n\nWhere did Shakspere learn his Italian, which, although then a court\nlanguage, he quotes but rarely, and in an awkward manner? Surely at\nsecond-hand, and probably quoting the phrases current at the period, or\nstill more probably from conning in his spare moments:\n\n    _An Italian Grammer, written in Latin by M. Scipio Lentulo: and turned\n    into Englishe by Henry Grantham. Typis Tho. Vautrolerij._\n\n        _London_, 16mo., 1578.\n\nThis was put to press again in 1587. In Vautrollier's 'shop' he would also\nhave often in his hands:\n\n    _Campo di Fior; or else the Flourie field of foure Languages, for the\n    furtherance of the learners of the Latine, French, English, but\n    chiefly of the Italian tongue. Imprinted at London, by Thos.\n    Vautrollier, dwelling in the Black Friers by Ludgate._\n\n        16mo., 1583.\n\nHere, again, we have a very extensive Italian vocabulary upon all common\nsubjects quite sufficient for an occasional quotation; as to the plots\ntaken from Italian sources, such as 'Romeo and Juliet', it seems to be now\ngenerally admitted that Shakspere in every instance followed the English\ntranslations.\n\nBut Shakspere knew also a little French, and uses a few colloquial\nsentences here and there. In one play indeed, _Henry V_, iii. 4, there is\na short scene between the Princess and her attendant, in alternate French\nand English, which reads almost like a page of a Vocabulary. Shakspere's\nknowledge of Latin was apparently about the same in extent; and for the\nuses to which he has applied both tongues, the _Flourie Field of Four\nLanguages_, already quoted as the source of his Italian, would be quite\nsufficient. If not, he had the opportunity of consulting under his\nmaster's roof\n\n    _A Treatise on French Verbs._\n\n        8vo., 1580.\n\n    _A most easie, perfect, and absolute way to learne the Frenche\n    tongue._\n\n        8vo., 1581; and\n\n    _Phrases Lingu\u00e6 Latin\u00e6._ 8vo., 1579;\n\nthe last compiled from the writings of that great Printer, Aldus Manutius.\n\nSome of Shakspere's biographers have maintained that he must have been\nacquainted with Plutarch and other classical writers, because he quotes\nfrom their works. Dr. Farmer in his masterly essay on the learning of\nShakspere, has shown that the Poet took all his quotations, even to the\nblunders, from the edition of Plutarch, in English, printed and published\nby Vautrollier, a year or two before we suppose that Shakspere entered\ninto his service:\n\n    _Plutarch's Lives, from the French of Amyott, by Sir Tho. North.\n    Licensed._\n\n        Folio, 1579.\n\nMoreover, Vautrollier, who was a good scholar, appears to have had a great\nliking for Ovid. He printed _Ovid's Metamorphoses_, _Ovid's Epistles_, and\n_Ovid's Art of Love_. Now it is a notable fact that although Shakspere,\nunlike contemporary writers who abound in classical allusions, scarcely\never mentions a Latin poet, and still more seldom a Greek poet, yet he\nquotes Ovid several times:\n\n    As Ovid, be an outcast quite abjured.\n                                _Taming of the Shrew_, i, 1.\n\n\n    _Tit._ Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?\n    _Luc._ Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses.\n                                _Titus_, iv, 1.\n\n\n      I am here with thee and thy goats as the most\n    capricious poet, honest Ovid was among the Goths.\n                                _As You Like It_, iii, 3.\n\n\n    Ovidius Naso was the man.\n                                _Love's Labour Lost_, iv, 2.\n\nOf _Cicero's Oration_ Vautrollier issued several editions, and had the\nprivilege 'ad imprimendum solum' granted him; and to this work also, on\nat least two occasions, Shakspere refers:\n\n              Hath read to thee\n    Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.\n                                _Titus_, iv, 1.\n\n\n    Sweet Tully.\n                                _2 Henry VI_, iv, 1.\n\nThe fact to be noted with reference to these classical quotations is this:\nShakspere quotes those Latin authors, and those only, of which Vautrollier\nhad a 'license'; and makes no reference to other and popular writers, such\nas Virgil, Pliny, Aurelius, and Terence, editions of whose works\nVautrollier was not allowed to issue, but all of which, and especially the\nlast, were great favorites in the sixteenth century, as is shown by the\nnumerous editions which issued from the presses of Vautrollier's\nfellow-craftsmen.\n\nAmong other publications of Vautrollier was an English translation of\n_Ludovico Guicciardini's Description of the Low Countries_, originally\nprinted in 1567. In this work is one of the earliest accounts of the\ninvention of printing at Haarlem, which is thus described in the Batavia\nof Adrianus Junius, 1575. 'This person [Coster] during his afternoon walk,\nin the vicinity of Haarlem, amused himself with cutting letters out of\nthe _bark_ of the beech tree, and with these, the _characters_ being\ninverted as in seals, he printed small sentences.' The idea is cleverly\nadapted by Orlando:\n\n            these trees shall be my _books_,\n    And in their _barks_ my thoughts I'll _character_.\n                                _As You Like It_, iii, 2.\n\nLastly, it would be an interesting task to compare the Mad Folk of\nShakspere, most of whom have the melancholy fit, with\n\n    _A Treatise of Melancholie: containing the Causes thereof and Reasons\n    of the Strange Effects it worketh in our Minds and Bodies._\n\n        _London_, 8vo., 1586.\n\nThis was printed by Vautrollier, and probably read carefully for press by\nthe youthful Poet.\n\nThe disinclination of Shakspere to see his plays in print has often been\nnoticed by his biographers, and is generally accounted for by the theory\nthat reading the plays in print would diminish the desire to hear them at\nthe theatre. This is a very unsatisfactory reason, and not so plausible as\nthe supposition that, sickened with reading other people's proofs for a\nlivelihood, he shrunk from the same task on his own behalf. His\ncontemporaries do not appear to have shared in the same typographical\naversion. The plays of Ben Jonson and Beaumont and Fletcher were all\nprinted in the life-time of their authors. Francis Quarles had the\nsatisfaction and pride of seeing all his works in printed form, and showed\nhis appreciation and knowledge of Typography by the following quaint\nlines, which we quote from the first edition, literatim:\n\n    _On a Printing-house._\n\n    The _world's_ a _Printing-house_: our _words_, our _thoughts_,\n    Our _deeds_, are _Characters_ of sev'rall sizes:\n    Each _Soule_ is a Compos'ter; of whose faults\n    The Levits are Correctors: Heav'n revises;\n    _Death_ is the _common Press_; fro whence, being driven,\n    W' are gathered _Sheet_ by _Sheet_, & bound for _Heaven_.\n                            From _Divine Fancies_, 1632, lib. iv, p. 164.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE TECHNICALITIES OF PRINTING, AS USED BY SHAKSPERE\n\n\nNature endows no man with knowledge, and although a quick apprehension may\ngo far toward making the true lover of Nature a Botanist, Zoologist, or\nEntomologist, and although the society of 'Men of Law', of Doctors, or of\nMusicians may, with the help of a good memory, store a man's mind with\nprofessional phraseology, yet the _opportunity_ of learning must be there;\nand no argument can be required to prove that, however highly endowed with\ngenius or imagination, no one could evolve from his internal consciousness\nthe terms, the customs, or the working implements of a trade with which he\nwas unacquainted. If, then, we find Shakspere's mind familiar with the\ntechnicalities of such an art as Printing--an art which, in his day, had\nno such connecting links with the common needs and daily pleasures of the\npeople, as now--if we find him using its terms and referring frequently to\nits customs, our claims to call him a Printer stand upon a firmer base\nthan those of the Lawyer, the Doctor, the Soldier, or the Divine; and we\nhave strong grounds for asking the reader's thoughtful attention to some\nquotations and arguments, which, if not conclusive that Shakspere was a\nPrinter, afford indubitable evidence of his having become at some period\nof his career practically acquainted with the details of a Printing\nOffice. We propose, then, to carefully examine the works of the Poet for\nany internal evidence of Typographical knowledge which they may afford.\n\nBut here, at the outset, we are met by obvious difficulties. Would\nShakspere, or any poet have made use of trade terms and technical words,\nor have referred to customs peculiar to and known by only a very small\nclass of the community in plays addressed to the general public? They\nmight have been familiar enough to the mind of the writer, but would\ncertainly have sounded very strange in the ears of the public. Shakspere\nwas too artistic and too wise to have committed so glaring a blunder. His\ntechnical terms are used unintentionally, and with the most charming\nunconsciousness. Therefore, when we meet with a word or phrase in common\nuse by Printers, it is so amalgamated with the context, that although\nsome other form of expression would have been chosen had not Shakspere\nbeen a Printer, yet the general reader or hearer is not struck by any\nincongruity of language.\n\nWhat simile could be more natural for a Printer-poet to use or more\nappropriate for the public to hear than this:\n\n    Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;\n    For she did _print_ your royal father off,\n    Conceiving you.\n                                _Winter's Tale_, v, 1.\n\nHere, surely, the Printer's daily experience of the exact agreement\nbetween the face of the type and the impression it yields must have\nsuggested the image.\n\nPrinters in Shakspere's time often had patents granted them by which the\nmonopoly of certain works was secured; and unscrupulous printers\nfrequently braved all the pains and penalties to which they were liable by\npirating such editions. It is this carelessness of consequences which is\nglanced at by Mistress Ford when debating with Mistress Page concerning\nthe insult put upon them by the heavy old Knight, Sir John Falstaff:\n\n      He cares not what he puts into the Press when he\n    would put us two.\n                                _Merry Wives_, ii, 1.\n\nWhat printer is there who has put to press a second edition of a book\nworking page for page in a smaller type and shorter measure but will\nrecognise the Typographer's reminiscences in the following description of\nLeontes' babe by Paulina:\n\n                    Behold, my Lords,\n    Although the _print_ be little, the whole _matter_\n    And _copy_ of the father ...\n    The very _mould_ and _frame_ of hand, nail, finger.\n                                _Winter's Tale_, ii, 3.\n\nIs it conceivable that a sentence of four lines containing five distinct\ntypographical words, three of which are especially technical, could have\nproceeded from the brain of one not intimately acquainted with Typography?\nAgain, would Costard have so gratuitously used a typographical idea, had\nnot the Poet's mind been teeming with them?\n\n    I will do it, sir, in print.\n                                _Love's Labour Lost_, iii, 1.\n\nThe deep indentation made on the receiving paper when the strong arm of a\nlusty pressman had pulled the bar with too great vigour is glanced at\nhere:\n\n    Think when we talk of horses that you see them\n    _Printing_ their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth.\n                                _Henry V_, Chorus.\n\nThe frequency with which the words _print_ or _imprint_ are used is very\nnoticeable:\n\n    The story that is _printed_ in her blood.\n                                _Much Ado about Nothing_, iv, 1.\n\n\n    I love a ballad in _print_.\n                                _Winter's Tale_, iv, 4.\n\n\n    She did _print_ your royal father off conceiving you.\n                                _Winter's Tale_, v, 1.\n\n\n    You are but as a _form_ in wax, by him _imprinted_.\n                                _Midsummer-Night's Dream_, i, 1.\n\n\n    His heart ... with your _print impressed_.\n                                _Love's Labour Lost_, ii, 1.\n\n\n    I will do it, sir, in _print_.\n                                _Love's Labour Lost_, iii, 1.\n\n\n    This weak _impress_ of love.\n                                _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, iii, 2.\n\n\n    To _print_ thy sorrows plain.\n                                _Titus Andronicus_, iv, 1.\n\n\n            Sink thy knee i' the earth;\n    Of thy deep duty, more _impression_ show.\n                                _Coriolanus_, v, 3.\n\n\n                        Some more time\n    Must wear the _print_ of his remembrance out.\n                                _Cymbeline_, ii, 3.\n\n\n    The _impressure_.\n                                _Twelfth Night_, ii, 5.\n\n\n    He will _print_ them, out of doubt.\n                                _Merry Wives of Windsor_, ii, 1.\n\n\n    We quarrel in _print_, by the book.\n                                _As You Like It_, v, 4.\n\n\n    Let it _stamp_ wrinkles in her brow.\n                                _Lear_, i, 4.\n\n\n    His sword death's _stamp_.\n                                _Coriolanus_, ii, 2.\n\nHear how deftly Title-pages are treated:\n\n          _Sim._ Knights,\n    To say you're welcome were superfluous.\n    To place upon the _volume_ of your deeds,\n    As in a _title-page_, your worth of arms,\n    Were more than you expect, or more than's fit.\n                                _Pericles_, ii, 3.\n\nHear, too, Northumberland, who thus addresses the bearer of fearful news:\n\n    This man's brow, like to a _title-leaf_,\n    Foretells the nature of a tragic _volume_.\n                                _2 Henry IV_, i, 1.\n\nEvidently Shakspere had a good idea of what a Title-page should contain.\n\nFrom Title to Preface is but a turn of the leaf, and its introductory\ncharacter is thus noticed:\n\n    Is but a _Preface_ of her worthy praise,\n    The chief perfections of that lovely dame.\n                                _1 Henry VI_, v, 5.\n\nWe must not forget a well-known passage about the introduction of Printing\nto England, which has caused much discussion. It is where Jack Cade\naccuses Lord Saye:\n\n    Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in\n    erecting a grammar-school: and whereas, before, our forefathers had no\n    other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to\n    be used; and, contrary to the king, his crown, and dignity, thou hast\n    built a paper mill.\n\n        _2 Henry VI_, iv, 7.\n\nThe early-invented fable of Faustus, and the assistance given him by the\nDevil in the multiplication of the first printed bibles (certainly a most\nshort-sighted step on the part of his Satanic Majesty) had got fixed in\nthe minds of the populace, and created among the ignorant a prejudice\nagainst the Printing-press, and it was to this feeling Jack Cade appealed.\nAll our Chroniclers place the erection of a Printing-press in England some\nyears too early, but no one except Shakspere has put the date so far back\nas 1450, the date of Jack Cade's insurrection: it is simply a blunder; but\nit was the Printing-press and its introduction to this country that was in\nthe Author's brain, and the _exact_ date of that event was unknown, being\nprobably as difficult to arrive at then as it is now.[1]\n\nWe have already noticed in how simple a manner originated that grand\ndiscovery which, instead of one perishable manuscript, produced numberless\nprinted books, and thus enabled mankind to perpetuate for ever the\nknowledge they had gained. The real superiority of the Press over the pen\nwas the easy multiplication of copies, and this was the idea in the Poet's\nbrain when he wrote:\n\n    She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby\n    Thou shouldst _print more_ nor let that copy die.\n                                _Sonnet_ xi.\n\nType-founding has in these days arrived at such perfection, that most of\nthe blemishes and faults common in Shakspere's time are now unknown. Under\nthe old system of hand moulds a type founder was sure when commencing work\nto cast a certain number of imperfect letters, because until the mould by\nuse got warmed, the liquid metal solidified too soon, and the body or\nshank of the type was shrunk, and became no inappropriate emblem of an old\nman's limbs whose hose would be\n\n    A world too wide for his shrunk shank.\n                                _As You Like It_, ii, 7.\n\nThe names of the various sizes of type in the sixteenth century were few\ncompared with our modern list; Canon, Great Primer, Pica, Long Primer, and\nBrevier almost complete the catalogue; and however familiar Shakspere may\nhave been with their names, it is difficult to imagine any scene in which\nthese technical names could be introduced with propriety. Yet, of one,\nNonpareil, a new small type first introduced from Holland about 1650, and\nwhich for its beauty and excellence was much admired, Shakspere seems to\nhave conceived a most favorable idea. Prospero, praising his daughter,\ncalls her 'a Nonpareil' (_Tempest_, Act iii, Sc. 2); Olivia is the\n'Nonpareil of beauty' (_Twelfth Night_, Act i, Scene 5); and Posthumus\nspeaks of Imogen as the 'Nonpareil of her time' (_Cymbeline_, Act ii,\nScene 5).\n\nThe exactitude and precision of everything connected with the arrangement\nof printing from types is curiously hinted at by Touchstone, when\ndescribing the preciseness of the Courtiers' quarrels:\n\n    We quarrel _in print by the book_.\n                                _As You Like It_, v, 4;\n\nthat is, no step was taken except according to acknowledged rules.\n\nIt often happens when a book comes to its last sheet that the text runs\nshort, and two or three blank or vacant pages remain at the end. In the\nmiddle of one of these it is usual to place the typographer's imprint.\nWhat compositor is there who has rejoiced in such _fat_ pages[2] but will\nnot at once recognise the following allusion:\n\n    The _vacant_ leaves thy mind's _imprint_ will bear,\n    And of this _book_ this learning mayst thou taste.\n                                _Sonnet_ lxxvii.\n\nPeople with a grievance write now-a-days to the Newspapers, in hope of\nredress. In Shakspere's time the only method to make wrongs public and to\nshow up abuses was by the _Broadside_, in prose or rhyme, passing from\nhand to hand. Many of these have survived to the present day, and are\ntreasured up as curious relics of a by-gone age. They were frequently\nlibellous and grievously personal, and hence the point of Pistol's remark:\n\n    Fear we broadsides?\n                                _2 Henry IV_, ii, 4.\n\nWe must not think here that the naval 'broadside'--a volley of guns from\nthe broadside of a ship--is meant. Shakspere does not use the word once in\nthat sense, nor was it a conversational word in his time. That Pistol was\nindeed thinking of a printed broad sheet is evident from the whole\nsentence, which, although composed of disjointed exclamations continues\nwith the following expressions, both strongly suggestive of the Composing\nroom or Reader's closet:\n\n      Come we to full points here? and are etceteras\n    nothing?\n                                  _2 Henry IV_, ii, 4.\n\n'Come we to full points here?' This question is often a puzzler for both\nCompositor and Reader. Indeed, few things cause more disagreements between\nAuthor and Printer than the very loose ideas held by the former concerning\npunctuation. Some writers, like Dickens in his early days, insist upon\nornamenting their sentences with little dashes and big dashes, with colons\nwhere commas should be, and with\n\n    _Points_ that seem impossible.\n                                _Pericles_, v, 1.\n\nIn vain does the Printer declare that in altering the Author's unregulated\npunctuation,\n\n    No levelled malice infests one _comma_,\n                                _Timon_, i, 1,\n\nthe irate Author exclaims, that he\n\n    Puts the _period_ often from his place,\n                                _Lucrece_, l. 565,\n\nand adds, 'Follow\n\n    My _point_ and period ... ill or well.\n                                _Lear_, iv, 7.\n\n\n    You find not the apostrophes, and so miss the accent.\n                                _Love's Labour Lost_, iv, 2.\n\n\n    Wherefore stand you on nice points?\n                                _3 Henry VI_, iv, 7.\n\nThe Printer has no resource but compliance, which, however, unless the\naffront be very severe, will soon\n\n    Stand a comma 'tween their amities,\n                                _Hamlet_, v, 2,\n\nand thus heal the breach, and end all happily with mutual\n\n    Notes of Admiration.\n                                _Winter's Tale_, v, 2.\n\n'And are etceteras nothing?' What a typographical question! and probably\nthe only occasion on which so unpoetical a figure has done duty in any\ndrama. The &c. makes an insignificant appearance in either MS. or type,\nand yet how often it stands for whole pages of matter. Hence the point of\nthe question.\n\nIf a book is folio, and two pages of type have been composed, they are\nplaced in proper position upon the imposing stone, and enclosed within an\niron or steel frame called a 'chase', small wedges of hard wood termed\n'coigns' or 'quoins' being driven in at opposite sides to make all tight.\n\n    By the four opposing coigns,\n    Which the world together joins.\n                                _Pericles_, iii, 1.\n\nThis is just the description of a forme in folio where two quoins on one\nside are always opposite to two quoins on the other, thus together\njoining and tightening all the separate stamps. In a quaint allegorical\npoem, published anonymously about the year 1700, in which the mystery of\nman's redemption is symbolised by the mystery of Printing, the author\ncommences thus:\n\n    Great blest Master Printer, come\n    Into thy Composing-room;\n\nand after 'spiritualising' the successive operations of the workman thus\ntouches upon the quoins:\n\n    Let the Quoins be thy sure Election,\n    Which admits of no Rejection;\n    With which our Souls being joined about,\n    Not the least Grace can then fall out.\n\nHere, the idea of joining together by quoins so that nothing shall fall\nout, is just the same as in the couplet quoted from Shakspere.\n\nThe tightening of these quoins by means of a wooden-headed mallet,\n\n    (There is no more conceit in him than is in a mallet,\n                                _2 Henry IV_, ii, 4),\n\nis called 'locking up', an exclusively technical term. The expression,\nhowever, occurs in 'Measure for Measure', IV, 2,\n\n    Fast locked up in sleep,\n\nwhere the idea conveyed is the same.\n\nThe 'Forme' worked off and the metal chase removed, leaving the pages\n'naked', affords the Poet the following simile, which although not\ncarrying to the popular ear any typographical meaning, was doubtless\nsuggested by Shakspere's former experience of the workshop:\n\n    And he but _naked_ though _locked up_ in steel.\n                                _2 Henry VI_, iii, 2.\n\nThe primary idea of 'locking up' had, doubtless, reference to 'armour';\nthe secondary to printing, as shown by the use of the word 'naked'.\n\nThe forme then went to the Press-room, where considerable ingenuity was\nrequired to make 'register'; that is, to print one side so exactly upon\nthe other, that when the sheet was held up to the light the lines on each\nside would exactly back one another. The accuracy of judgment required for\nthis is thus glanced at:\n\n    _Eno._ But let the world rank me in _register_\n           A master-leaver and a fugitive.\n                                _Antony and Cleopatra_, iv, 9.\n\nWhen the green-eyed Othello takes his wife's hand and exclaims:\n\n    Here's a young and sweating devil,\n                                _Othello_, iii, 4,\n\nwe fail at first to catch the idea of the Poet in calling a hand a\n'devil'; but take the word as synonymous with 'messenger', and we see at\nonce how the moist plump palm of Desdemona suggested to the intensely\njealous husband the idea of its having been the lascivious messenger of\nher impure desires. In this sense of 'messenger', the word 'devil' has a\nspecial fitness; for it is, and always has been among Printers, _and\nPrinters only_, another word for 'errand-boy'. In olden times, when speed\nwas required, a boy stood at the off-side of the press, and as soon as the\nfrisket was raised, whipped the printed sheet off the tympan. When not at\nwork, he ran on messages between printer and author, who, on account of\nhis inky defilement, dubbed him 'devil'. All Printers' boys go now by the\nsame name:\n\n    Old Lucifer, both kind and civil,\n    To ev'ry Printer lends a Devil;\n    But balancing accounts each winter,\n    For ev'ry Devil takes a Printer.\n\nMoxon, in 1683, quotes it as an old trade word, and it was doubtless the\nsame in Shakspere's time, a century earlier, as it is now two centuries\nlater. But where could Shakspere have picked up the word if not in the\nPrinting-office?\n\nAny one accustomed to collate old MSS. must have noticed how very seldom\nthe copyist would, in transcribing, add nothing and omit nothing. If what\nthe scribe considered a good idea entered his mind while his pen was\ntravelling over the page, he was a very modest penman indeed, if he did\nnot incorporate it in the text. From this cause, and from genuine\nunintentional blunders, the texts of all the old authors had become\ngradually very corrupt--a source of great trouble to the early Printers.\nWith this in his mind Shakspere defines it as one of the qualities of Time\n\n    To blot old books and alter their contents.\n                                _Lucrece_, l. 948.\n\nMany of Vautrollier's publications must have been printed from discolored\nold manuscripts; and these papers Shakspere, if he read 'proof' for his\nemployer, would have to study carefully. Does he call this to mind in\nSonnet XVII?\n\n    My papers yellowed with their age.\n\nWas it, after admiring some beautifully illuminated Hor\u00e6, that he wrote:\n\n    O that record could with a backward look,\n      E'en of five hundred courses of the sun;\n    Show me your image in some antique book,\n      Since mind at first in character was done.\n                                _Sonnet_ lix.\n\nDoes the Poet refer to its wonderfully burnished gold initials, and the\nred dominical letters which he must often have seen in the printed\ncalendars, when he exclaims in tones of admiration:\n\n    My red dominical--my golden letter!\n                                _Love's Labour Lost_, v, 2.\n\nThe old calendar had a _golden number_ and a _dominical letter_, but not a\n_golden letter_, which last must refer specifically to the practice of\ngilding important initials. 'Golden Letters' are mentioned in 'King John',\nIII, 1, and in 'Pericles', IV, 4, while the red initials, which were\ncommon to both manuscripts and printed books of the fifteenth century, are\nmade by Shakspere the death warrant of the unfortunate Clerk of Chatham,\nagainst whom is brought the fatal accusation that he\n\n    Has a book in his pocket with red letters in 't.\n                                _2 Henry VI_, iv, 2.\n\nIn Shakspere's time, as we have already noticed (p. 41, ante), the press\nlaboured under great restrictions. All books with a profitable\ncirculation were monopolised by favored stationers or printers who held\nspecial patents or licenses from the Crown. Thus Reynold Wolfe, in 1543,\nheld a monopoly of all books printed in Hebrew, Greek, or Latin. Seres was\nprivileged to print all psalters, primers, and prayer books; Denham might\nprint the New Testament in Welch; others held grants for scholastic or\nlegal books, for almanacs, and even for broadsides, or as the grant says\n'for any piece of paper printed on one side of the sheet only'. In these\nfavored books it was customary to place the patent granting the monopoly\nat the end, as a 'caveat' for other printers, and occasionally the phrase\n'Cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum' would appear in a conspicuous part\nof the title. Among the printers in London, who secured such special\nprivileges, was Vautrollier, Shakspere's presumed employer. 'In the\nsixteenth year of Elizabeth, 19th June, 1574', says Ames, 'a patent or\nlicense was granted him which he often printed at the end of the New\nTestament'; this was a monopoly of Beza's New Testament which Vautrollier\nhad the privilege 'ad imprimendum solum', for the term of ten years. We\nhave already seen the curious connection between the products of\nVautrollier's press and the writings of Shakspere, and we now plainly\nperceive what was floating in the Poet's brain when he placed the\nfollowing speech in Biondello's mouth, who urges Lucentio to marry Bianca,\nwhile her father and the pedant are discussing the marriage treaty:\n\n    _Luc._ And what of all this?\n\n    _Bion._ I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a counterfeit[3]\n    assurance: Take your assurance of her _cum privilegio ad imprimendum\n    solum_: to the church;--take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient\n    honest witnesses.\n\n        _Taming of the Shrew_, iv, 4.\n\nThese protective privileges, 'ad imprimendum solum', instead of a benefit\nwere a great hindrance to the growth of Printing. Many master-printers\neven then felt them to be so, and by all legal and sometimes illegal\nmeans, tried to procure the abolition of laws which were oppressive and\nrestrictive. They saw works of merit die out of memory for want of\nenterprise in the patentee--they saw folly, in the shape of a\nStar-chamber, controlling skill; or as Shakspere himself expresses it,\n\n    Art made tongue-tied by authority,\n    And Folly (doctor-like),[4] controlling skill.\n                                _Sonnet_ lxvi.\n\nShakspere abounds in kisses of every hue, from shadowy, frozen, and Judas\nkisses, to holy, true, gentle, tender, warm, sweet, loving, dainty, kind,\nsoft, long, hard, zealous, burning, and even the unrequited kiss:\n\n    But my kisses bring again\n    Seals of love, but seal'd in vain.\n                                _Measure for Measure_, iii, 1.\n\nThe 'burning' kiss might be thought passionate and even durable enough for\nany extremity--yet Shakspere prefers, perhaps from an unconscious\nassociation of ideas, the durability of which _Printing_ is the emblem\nwhen he makes the Goddess of Love exclaim:\n\n    Pure lips, sweet seals on my soft lips _imprinted_.\n                                _Venus and Adonis_, l. 511.\n\nThe same idea of durability is expressed in the cry of Henry's guilty\nQueen, when parting with Suffolk:\n\n    Oh, could this kiss be _printed_ on thy hand!\n                                _2 Henry VI_, iii, 2.\n\nThe idea has been still further developed in the following anonymous\nquatrain:\n\n    A PRINTER'S KISSES.\n\n    _Print_ on my lips another kiss,\n      The picture of my glowing passion.\n    Nay, this wont do--nor this, nor this;\n      But now--Ay, that's a _proof impression_.\n\nMany of Vautrollier's publications went through several editions. In the\n'Merry Wives', II, 1, Mistress Page says:\n\n    These are of the second edition,\n\nand well can we imagine Shakspere handing volumes to a buyer with the same\nremark, or asking some patron with whom he was a favourite:\n\n    Com'st thou with deep premeditated lines,\n    With written pamphlet studiously devised?\n                                _1 Henry VI_, iii, 1.\n\nas the author entered with a roll of 'copy' in his hand.\n\nIn the deep mine from which the foregoing quotations have been dug, many\nothers would doubtless reward a more careful search. As it is, numerous\nallusions, which, though plain to a printer, would seem too forced to the\ngeneral public, have been passed over. Enough, however, has probably been\nbrought forward to justify the belief pourtrayed in the title-page, viz.:\n_That Shakspere must have passed some of his early years in a\nPrinting-office._\n\n\nFinis\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] _The exact date was probably as difficult to arrive at then as now._\nThe arrival of William Caxton in England may, with a certainty of being\nnear the truth, be placed in 1475-6, the date 1474 given by most writers\nbeing a misconception of the language used by Caxton in the Preface to the\nChess-book. The Art on its first introduction was looked upon suspiciously\nby the people, few of whom could read, its chief patrons being a few of\nthe more educated among the nobles and the rich burghers of London.\nAnother mistake is to suppose that Caxton printed in Westminster Abbey.\nHis printing-office was a tenement to the south-east of the Abbey Church;\nits sign was the 'Red-pale', and Caxton rented it of the Abbot. There is\nevidence to show that Caxton and the Abbot were on distant terms of\namity--none to show that the Ecclesiastic encouraged or patronised the\nPrinter, notwithstanding Dean Stanley's assertions in a sermon lately\npreached by him in Westminster Abbey. The _only_ occasion upon which\nCaxton mentions the Abbot is to this effect--that the Abbot, not being\nable himself to read a passage in old MS., sent it to Caxton, with a\nrequest that he would translate it. (See _The Life and Typography of\nWilliam Caxton_, by William Blades. 2 vols., 4to. London, 1861-63.)\n\n[2] _Fat Pages._ 'Fat' as a conventional word is not confined to Printers.\n'A _fat_ living' is a phrase not unknown among churchmen, and is used in\nthe same sense by the compositor, who charges the master-printer for the\n_fat_ pages, in which no work appears, at the same rate as if they were\nfull.\n\n[3] This word 'counterfeit' in the sense of 'reprint' or 'duplicate', is\ncertainly not used now-a-days by English printers; yet I find this in\nMarahren's Parallel List of technical Typographical terms:--'Counterfeit,\nto, or to Reprint, v., Nachdrucken.--R\u00e9-imprimer.' With Bibliographers the\nword is still retained; _e.g._ 'Lyons counterfeits of the Aldine\neditions.'\n\n[4] _And Folly (doctor-like) controlling skill._ It is worth noting, that\nin none of the various volumes written to show Shakspere's knowledge of\nmedicine and medical men, has the truth of this passage been brought\nforward in evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
