    "body": "Others before him had tried--and failed. Ron Farr meant to succeed. He\nhad come fully prepared to surmount whatever obstacles might lie in\nhis path, to conquer the dread guardian jungle and its unknown terrors\nand return triumphant to Earth, master of destiny and possessor of\nundreamed of power.\n\nFarr knew the obstacles would be there, for he sought the secret of\neternal life, the fabulous elixir that lay hidden somewhere on Phoebe,\nenigmatic moon of Saturn, and there was little doubt in his mind that\nthe ancients of the ringed planet had made ample provision for the\nprotection of this, their most cherished treasure. One by one, a dozen\neager men had gone in quest of the secret--none had returned. That was\nenough proof for him.\n\nBut, in spite of this grim evidence, Farr was not afraid. He was\nready to face death itself, if need be, to gain the goal that would\nprostrate the world at his feet. He was ready to face death, but he\nhad taken every precaution against it. For instance, in selecting a\nlikely landing place, he had shunned the area in which the life secret\nwas reputed to be, for his instruments had detected some sort of\nforce-field above the region. Invisible to the eye, the field would\nhave crushed his ship in an instant, had he attempted to enter the area\nwithout consulting the instrument panel.\n\nThe region was boxed in on three sides by sheer cliffs, leaving but one\navenue of approach. That was through the dense and foreboding jungle\nthat stretched for miles across the face of the canyon.\n\nFarr had taken that avenue. Now, as he stepped from his ship and\nregarded the jungle's fringe with clear, steady eyes, he looked\nanything but the ruthless brigand he was.\n\nStraight black hair, high forehead, firm, unsmiling lips--all gave the\nman the appearance of a gentlemanly scholar. But behind those austere\nfeatures lurked a cunning, treacherous mind. That he should be seeking\nthe secret of eternal life in so surreptitious a manner was proof that\nthe gaining of it would be put to his own advantage, and not to the\nbenefit of mankind.\n\nNow the thin lips parted in a wry smile as his searching gaze focused\non a group of watchful creatures gathered silently at the jungle's\nedge. Somber eyes stared unwinkingly back at him.\n\nHarmless beings, these, the _Mumums_ of Phoebe. They resembled Earthly\npygmies in stature, but were wholly alien in anatomy. Hairless and\nebon-skinned, they wore only a loincloth as protection against the\nelements. Depending from this brief garment by means of a length of\nchain swung a small silvery, tubelike affair. Some sort of tribal\nfetish, Farr thought, intended to ward off evil spirits. The tubes\ngave off a musical tinkling whenever the pygmies moved, and he almost\nhad to laugh at their ignorance in believing such nonsense could avert\nsickness and injury.\n\nThey seemed to be attempting to bar his way. He drew his blaster and\nbalanced it in his hand, smiling grimly. If nothing more ferocious than\nthese miserable beings were to test his strength and cunning, securing\nthe life secret was going to be an easy task.\n\nHe stepped forward. The _Mumums_ did not move. His steps brought him\ncloser, and still they remained in his way. Farr curled his lips and\nraised his blaster. If it was necessary to teach them a lesson, he\nwould.\n\nOne more stride and he would be touching them. \"You asked for it,\" he\ngritted and squeezed the release.\n\nThere was a hissing crack and a bright stab of flame. The _Mumum_ in\nfront of Farr fell stiffly over backwards without a sound, an ugly\nsmoking hole drilled clean through him. The others cringed and drew\nback as Farr swung the blaster in a threatening arc. \"Get the idea?\" he\ngrinned.\n\n\n\nSweat plastered Farr's shirt to his back and streamed copiously down\nhis masklike face. It was only an hour since he had entered the jungle,\nbut already he was beginning to tire. His wiry muscles ached and his\nbreath came wheezily, laboriously. Wearily he sat down on a porous rock\nand produced a vacuum-carton from his tunic pocket. The mushy food\nmixture contained in the carton was tasteless, but nourishing, and he\nate in contemplative silence, keeping a wary eye on the foliage around\nhim.\n\nThus far he had successfully avoided contact with malignant life-forms,\nbut he did not allow this fact to lull him into a complacence that\nmight prove his undoing. Even though the jungle denizens had not yet\nmanifested themselves, he knew they were there, waiting for him to grow\nlax in his vigilance, waiting for his eyes to close in sleep--a sleep\nfrom which he would never awaken.\n\nThe _Mumums_--the pygmy people--were still with him. They stood a few\nfeet away, soulful eyes watching him devour his meal. Their stares\nvaguely irritated Farr. What made it the worse, was that they never\nuttered a sound, but just watched silently, fingering those crazy\nsilver tubes, moving when he moved, freezing into immobility when he\ncalled a halt, always keeping between him and the goal toward which he\nprogressed.\n\nFarr uttered a sneering laugh. They couldn't stop him! Let them stare.\nLet their saucer eyes reproach him. He would go on and emerge from the\njungle with the secret that would place the fate of the world in his\nhands.\n\nHe laughed again and wiped the last particles of the meal from his\nlips. The food was making him sleepy. Gratefully he allowed leaden lids\nto close over sun-dazzled eyes. A keen sense of danger prodded his\ndrowsy mind, telling him to awake, to throw off the torpor before the\nperils of the jungle closed in on him.\n\nBy will-power alone, Farr forced his eyes open and strove desperately\nto rise. He seemed to be rooted to the rock, and the insidious lump of\nmatter was sucking out his life-force, draining him of vitality. Where\nhe had been prepared to face fang and claw, this inanimate foe had\ncaught him completely off-guard and was swiftly fulfilling the purpose\nfor which it had been placed here--the destruction of interlopers who\nsought the secret of immortality by way of the jungle.\n\nA less determined man than Farr would have succumbed to that compelling\nforce, would have fallen back on the stone and let the life flow from\nhis exhausted body. But Farr was made of stern stuff, and as long as\nthere was life in him, there was fight.\n\nSweat stood out in glistening beads on his forehead and his lips\ncompressed in a bloodless slit as he marshaled his powers of\nconcentration. Slowly his hand moved to his side, clutching at the\nblaster that hung there. Minutes passed as his fingers closed around\nthe butt of the gun and inched it from the holster.\n\nHis thumb adjusted the weapon to a tight beam, then he was aiming it\nsteadily at the rock. A thin finger of flame lanced out and drilled\ninto the porous stone, devouring it hungrily. A moment later he leaped\nfree as the chunk of mineral cracked under the heat and suddenly\ncollapsed in a pile of jumbled fragments.\n\n\n\nFarr was too shaken for a moment to do anything but stare in horror at\nthe cooling pieces of the devil stone. Then, reaction over, he became\nhis calculating, impassive self again. Reflection on the fate he had\nnarrowly averted was not for him; he must push on. But he did marvel\nat the cleverness of the ancients of Saturn in placing the stone here.\nIt had come close to getting him--too close, for he felt strangely\nlethargic and weak.\n\nGroping in a pocket he brought forth a vitamin capsule and popped it in\nhis mouth. The potent stuff went to work immediately and shortly Farr\ncould feel his energy returning, slowly at first, then faster as the\ncapsule's contents worked through his bloodstream.\n\nFeeling better, he tested his legs, then moved forward once more,\nresuming his interrupted progress through the brooding jungle. Before\nhim the ever-present _Mumums_ retreated slowly, backing away through\nthe underbrush, always with their sad eyes fixed unwaveringly on the\nintruder.\n\nFarr had come to hate those eyes, in the short space of time he had\nknown the creatures. Though he realized now that neither they nor their\nowners could do him harm, still he was somehow disturbed by the intent\nand mournful gaze.\n\nShrugging off the feeling, he plodded on, moving ever toward the\ndistant goal in utter defiance of the terrors lurking around him. Farr\nwould not be denied his triumph and, now that he knew what to look for,\nhe kept a wary eye out for other such diabolical traps as the devil\nstone.\n\nBut, in spite of his caution, he had not the least suspicion of the\nnext snare that lay in his path, and he was hopelessly enmeshed in it\nbefore his confused mind could understand what was happening.\n\nHe had been advancing on a small grassy clearing, and as he reached\nits edge he stopped to regard it dubiously. The wood-free tract seemed\ninnocent enough, and its flat expanse offered no concealment for\ncontrivances intended to dispose of meddlers. Satisfied that it was\nsafe, he set foot on the clearing and moved quickly across it.\n\nHalfway across, Farr felt the ground shake under him and a low muffled\ndroning began somewhere far below. He knew then that it was a trap, and\nwith the celerity of one pursued by a fiend, lengthened his stride into\na desperate run. But it was too late.\n\nThings suddenly went black, and with the abrupt darkness that fell\nover his eyes, Farr stumbled and fell face forward in the grass.\nPanic-stricken, he clambered to his feet and passed a hand across his\nface. He saw only blackness.\n\n\"My Lord!\" he cried in horror. \"I'm _blind_!\"\n\nFarr could feel his lips moving, knew that his frantic brain had\ncommanded the vocal organs to speak the words--but he could not hear\nthem. He was deaf, too. Blind and deaf! Walking through the glade,\nhis footsteps had set in action machinery buried deep in the earth,\nmachinery that emitted a penetrating ray, blanking out the senses of\nsight and hearing. Now, surely, his quest would end in blind groping\nthrough the forest, till some ravenous denizen would put a stop to his\nmisery.\n\n\n\nFlinging his head back, Farr laughed shrilly, madly. Facing the guns of\nthe planetary police, he had never known the feel of fear, but he knew\nit now; fear of the darkness, fear of the silence that pressed in on\nhim. He cried out again, but not the least sound pierced the stillness\nin his brain.\n\nHe suddenly lunged forward and ran screaming through the glade. He did\nnot stop until he felt the undergrowth of the jungle whipping about his\nlegs, then he sank to the ground in a cringing heap, sobbing out his\ndespair and beating his fists against his temples.\n\nFor an hour he sat there, staring sightlessly into space. Frenzy gave\nway to apathy, and he no longer strove to fight off the implacable\nblackness and quiet that filled his world. Death would come soon,\ncreeping and crawling through the brush, and he could do nothing but\nsit and wait for it, without hope of defending himself.\n\nDespite his despair, Farr was not the least bit penitent. He had played\nthe game and lost, and now he was ready to pay the price of failure.\nHis only regret was that he had fallen short of his goal, had been\ncheated of it by the infernal ray device, one of the many traps that\nhad been placed throughout the jungle by the now long-dead ancients of\nSaturn.\n\nHis features hardened as he thought again of the secret those pitfalls\nguarded--the secret of immortality. If only he could yet reach it!\nFumble his way through the jungle somehow and take the treasure from\nits cursed temple. He could still be master of the world, if he could\naccomplish that, master of all worlds, in fact, for who would not\nprostrate himself for the chance of possessing eternal life?\n\nBut it was hopeless, Farr knew. He could wander around in here until he\ndropped, and still be no nearer his destination than when he started.\nNor could he find his way back to the ship, navigate the distance to\nEarth and have his eyes and ears operated on by some unprincipled, yet\nskillful surgeon. No, he would never have another chance at the life\nsecret, never return to civilization with the power that he--\n\n_What was that? Was it a glimmer of light in the darkness?_\n\nFarr's heart leaped with sudden hope. Was his mind playing him tricks,\nor was his sight returning? He climbed to his feet, straining his eyes\nat the pinpoint of light. No, it wasn't his imagination; his vision was\ndefinitely coming back! As he watched, the small patch of brightness\ngrew slowly, expanding, pushing back the fearsome darkness.\n\n\"_I--I can see again_,\" he whispered, voice shaking with emotion. Then,\nflaming with new-born spirit, he repeated in a shout, \"I can see again!\"\n\nHis joy knew no bounds as he witnessed the unfolding of this miracle.\nIn short minutes his eyesight had completely returned to normal and\nhis hearing, too, was rapidly improving. He began talking to himself,\nsavoring the sound of each word as it impinged on his eardrums.\nHe caught sight of the _Mumums_, standing at a distance, mute and\nmotionless as ever, and he yelled to them, \"Hi, you ugly things! Am I\nglad to see you!\"\n\nIndeed, Farr was glad to see anything again, after that awful blackness\nthat had blotted out his most precious sense. The ray had been intended\nto destroy his hearing and sight, but he had escaped its field in time\nto avoid permanent injury. Had it not been for the unreasoning fear\nthat overwhelmed him, he would have remained there in the glade, to\nflounder about helplessly and eventually succumb to thirst and hunger.\n\nNow, he was again in full possession of his faculties, and just as\ndetermined as ever to continue on to his destination. Twice he had\nfallen prey to the ingenious devices of the Ancients, and both times\nemerged unscathed. He was now convinced that the jungle could produce\nno obstacle that his cunning could not overcome.\n\nThus decided, Farr took his bearings. Finding that his flight had\nbrought him to that side of the glade nearest his goal, he had nothing\nto do but resume his march through the lush Phoebe plant-life.\n\nOn two occasions during the next few hours he came across grim\ndiscoveries, discoveries that made him shudder in spite of his\ncallousness--sun-bleached, grinning skeletons. He found the first one\ndraped over a devil stone, picked free of carrion, mute testimony of\nthe insidious rock's power.\n\nThe other lay not far away in a clump of bushes. As Farr approached,\nthe willowy branches of the shrubs whipped into sudden action, flicking\ngobs of black, gooey matter directly at the surprised spaceman. He\ndodged aside with a cry of dismay, barely averting contact with the\nstuff. Several of the viscid wads plopped against the bole of a tree\nand began eating furiously into the bark.\n\nEyes bulging, Farr turned and fled, putting distance between himself\nand the deadly bushes. No wonder there hadn't been much left of that\nsecond heap of bones! The shrubs were living acid manufactories,\nremaining dormant until the approach of a victim, then to spring into\nlife and bombard the prey with gobs of the fatal stuff.\n\nAnd those blanched remains back there--they had once been living men,\nlike himself, in search of the legendary life secret. But unlike him,\nthey had not been clever enough to elude the pitfalls of the jungle,\nand had died agonizing deaths, miles short of the goal. Farr was glad\nit was so, else the secret would not now be there for him to pluck from\nits pedestal and mold to his own use.\n\n\n\nMany hours later, Farr emerged from the jungle to stand at last at\nthe entrance to a desolate canyon. Aching in every muscle, battered,\nbruised and hardly able to stay on his feet, he felt a surge of new\nenergy as he spied his objective, near the center of the valley.\n\nThe temple was old, very old. Its walls were drab gray, as if with the\ngrayness of age, and a great silence hung over it, unbroken by even the\nstrident sounds of insect life. But in spite of its gloomy, tomb-like\nappearance, there was an air of magnificence about the temple, a\nfaint aura of greatness once known, but long since gone. It was at\nonce beautiful and foreboding, guardian of the heritage left by the\nAncients to those with courage and intelligence enough to win it.\n\nFarr was not impressed. Beauty meant nothing to him, save the beauty of\npower. But he noted the _Mumums_, still with him, were stirred by the\nscene. Throughout the trek through the jungle, they had shown no signs\nof emotion, but now they were milling about restlessly, staring at the\ntemple and chattering excitedly among themselves.\n\nDrawing a deep breath, he moved cautiously into the canyon, blaster\nready at his side. There was no telling what hellish devices he had yet\nto face, and he did not intend to be robbed of the life secret now,\nhaving come this far along the road.\n\nSheer cliffs soared high above on three sides of him, and one look\ntold him that no one could scale those dizzy heights. The _Mumums_,\nscampering ahead of him, silver tubes tinkling melodiously, reached\nthe edifice's yawning portal and stood staring apprehensively into the\nimpenetrable darkness. He followed quickly, eager to secure the elixir\nand leave this dismal canyon far behind.\n\nTwenty feet from the looming entrance, something rattled loosely under\nhis step and he bent to examine the object. A skull. His eyes traveled\nacross the ground and spied the body of the skeleton lying between two\nboulders. He stepped over to the grisly relic and knelt beside it,\nregarding it thoughtfully.\n\nClutched in the bony fingers was a corroded blaster, and through the\ntatters of the dead man's rotted tunic protruded charred stumps of\nribs, grim indication of the last use to which the gun had been put.\nSuicide! But why? Had the man been enmeshed in some trap from which\nthere was no escape? No; if that were the case Farr himself would\nnow be caught in its toils. At this realization he jumped back with\na start, cursing his thoughtlessness in approaching the spot without\nfirst examining the surroundings.\n\nBut nothing happened and, thus reassured, he moved close again,\npuzzling over the inexplicable mystery confronting him. To all\nappearances the man had been free to leave the valley whenever he\nso willed. Yet he had snuffed out his own life--that last desperate\nmeasure one takes when he is faced by some barrier above which his\nresources cannot lift him.\n\nTiring of the problem, Farr gave the remains one last scornful look and\nmoved away. He had no sympathy for one who comes out second best in a\ncontest of cunning. But as he walked on to the temple and passed into\nits shadows he felt a dark premonition of danger edging into his mind.\n\nHe paused inside the structure's entrance and switched on a torch,\nsweeping its beam about the chamber in which he stood. The room was\ncubical, small, dank and musty with age. Blank walls stared back at him\nmockingly, and for the briefest instant he again experienced a feeling\nof impending doom, then it faded as before.\n\nBefore moving on into the temple proper, he looked over his shoulder to\nsee if the _Mumums_ had followed. They hadn't. They crowded around the\nportal, jabbering shrilly and jostling one another in their eagerness\nto get a better view, but carefully refrained from entering.\n\nShrugging, he turned away. He had no time to wonder at the stupidity\nof the _Mumums_; there were more important matters to look after.\nDirecting the ray of the torch before him he located an inner door and\nmoved through it, heart leaping in sudden excitement at the sight.\n\nThere, resting in solitary splendor atop a marble pillar in the center\nof a vast hall, was the object which he had braved every conceivable\ntype of horror to obtain. Awed in spite of himself, he walked slowly\nforward, eyes riveted in fascination on the gleaming prize.\n\nThen the spell was gone and he broke into a run, a shout of exultation\non his lips. He caught up the object from its pedestal and waved it\nwildly overhead, brain enfevered by the triumph of the moment. He\nbrought the gleaming metal cylinder in front of his eyes and gazed at\nit in rapture. Power. This represented more power than any man had\nknown, and plans for its use were already spinning in his brain.\n\nSomething rustled dryly in the vacuum container. Powder; it was a\npowder, rather than a liquid. The legend had erred on that point,\nbut the discrepancy was inconsequential. He peered eagerly at the\ncontainer, expecting to see the formula of the powder inscribed\nthereon. There was none, but it did not disturb him. Chemists could\nanalyze the stuff and manufacture it.\n\nFlashing his light once more over the great hall to make certain he had\nmissed nothing, he strode buoyantly to the entrance and passed into the\nsmall outer chamber, thrusting the container of powder in his tunic\npocket as he went.\n\n\n\nImmediately a dazzling brilliance lit up the room. Varicolored lights\nplayed about his head, blazed radiantly in his brain and etched every\ncell in bold relief. Farr fell to his knees, throwing his arms over his\neyes in a vain effort to shut out the light. The torment in his mind\nwas unbearable, agonizing.\n\nThe door! He had to make it to the door! Stumbling to his feet, he\npropelled himself on unsteady legs to the entrance, hurtled through it\nand down the temple steps, where he collapsed in a quivering, gasping\nheap on the rocky valley floor.\n\nAnother narrow escape! He could not guess the nature or effect of the\nlights, but undoubtedly they had been meant to dispose of him in some\nhellish fashion. Apparently he had sustained no injury, though his head\ndid feel peculiarly light.\n\nShaking his head dizzily, Farr arose and felt in his pocket. The\ncylindrical container was still there, and he breathed a rasping sigh\nof relief. All that remained now was to return to his ship and rocket\nEarthward, where his plans for the life secret would immediately be put\ninto effect.\n\nThe _Mumums_ brought up the rear now, apparently resigned to the fact\nthat their puny efforts to prevent the theft of the secret had failed.\nKnowing that he would no longer be confronted by their unwinking gaze\nwas a comfort to Farr, and he moved quickly across the sweltering\nvalley.\n\nMoving rapidly as he was, he had no time to avoid crashing into the\ntowering wall of rock that loomed suddenly in his path. Strangely he\nfelt no pain as he clambered erect, but the very unexpectedness of the\ncollision stunned him, confusing his befuddled mind even more.\n\nThere should be no wall here, yet here it was. Farr could not deny\nthat, though he could have sworn it had not been here when he entered\nthe canyon. There was nothing to do but walk around it.\n\nThe cliff stretched a hundred yards to either side of him. He began\nmoving along it, a fierce anxiety to escape this infernal place beating\nin his brain. The inscrutable _Mumums_ followed, pattering along on\nbare feet.\n\nHe had covered what seemed like forty yards, when he stopped and stared\nin puzzlement at the craggy precipice. He looked back along the wall,\nthen ahead, peered up at its dizzy heights, then down at its smooth\nbase. Color drained from his face and his shoulders slumped in defeat.\n\nHe was beaten. Farr knew it. Knew too why that other adventurer had\nnever left the valley, why his brain was spinning and whirling like\na mad dervish. The ray in the temple--he could easily guess now what\nit had done to him. For stone does not move of its own power, and the\ncliff _had_ moved. Its terminations still reared a hundred yards in\neither direction from him!\n\nIt was an illusion, that wall, an illusion conjured by his own\nray-impregnated mind. But for him it was real. He could spend eternity\nwalking along its face, yet never would he reach the end of the barrier.\n\nHe watched dully as a _Mumum_ scampered past and melted into the cliff.\nMaddening to know that the wall existed only in his own mind. He tried\nto concentrate, tried to nullify the terrible force that had invaded\nhis brain. If he could do that, the cliff-illusion would vanish.\n\nVeins stood out on his forehead with the effort; but the wall remained,\nseemingly solid as ever to his touch. The ray-force was too powerful.\n\nFarr wanted to scream, wanted to hurl himself at the barrier and\npound and tear at it with all the wild energy of a trapped animal.\nBut he couldn't. His emotions were played out. He could only stand\nlike a burnt-out robot, his apathetic eyes following the antics of the\n_Mumums_ as they popped in and out of the wall-illusion, taunting him,\ntrying to drive him mad with the realization that only he could not\npass through it to freedom.\n\nThe Ancients had triumphed. The life secret would remain in this\nvalley, eternally guarded by the ingenious ray that warped men's minds\nand made them see illusions that to them were insuperable actualities.\nNot until a Master Intellect claimed the heritage for the human race,\nwould it ever leave here.\n\nFarr was not that Master Intellect, and he knew what he must do now.\nHis blaster came slowly from its holster. He brought the gun to his\ntemple.\n\nHis finger tightened on the trigger. White fire exploded in his brain,\ncooking the cells, melting them. A last scream of defiance ripped from\nFarr's lips, then his form went suddenly limp and crumpled to the\nground, to lay silent....\n\n\n\nIt was Londar's time to return the cylinder to the temple. Its contents\nwere worthless, he knew, but it was the Ancients' command that the\nritual be observed, so the pygmy-creature dutifully bent and retrieved\nthe gleaming container and walked slowly with it toward the brooding\nedifice.\n\nTo carry out his mission, Londar would be forced to pass through the\nGreat Lights, and Londar was afraid of the lights, much in the same way\nsavages of Earth fear the magic of witch doctors. But the intelligence\nof the _Mumums_ was slightly above that of savages, and Londar realized\nin a vague way that the lights could not harm him, could not do the\nthings to him they had done to the black-haired man from the sky.\n\nFor, long ago, he had swallowed several of the mysterious crystals\ncontained in the small silver tube swinging at his waist. The Ancients\nhad commanded him to do that and Londar had complied, as had all his\nrace, out of their great respect and love for the wise ones. The\nAncients were gone now, had vanished into the sky many seasons since.\nBut Londar and his people had lived on, ageless, undying, tirelessly\nperforming the strange duties assigned them by the masters.\n\nSome day, another great race would come, and Londar's people would\nthen surrender the silver tubes. The black-haired man might have been\nthe representative of such a race, but he had shown contempt for the\n_Mumums_ and had slain Kyrrad. That would not be the way of a true\npeople of supreme intellect.\n\nLondar walked on, the silvery tube fastened at his waist tinkling\nmusically in rhythm to his stride.\n",
