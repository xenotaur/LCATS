Tuttle\n         Author of \u201cOn the Prod,\u201d \u201cThe Sundown Prodigal,\u201d etc.\n\n\nIt was easy to see that fate had been kind to Ferdinand P. Putney,\nbecause he was not in jail. In fact, he never had been in jail. But he\nwas comparatively a young man yet. He was six feet three inches tall,\nwould weigh about a hundred and forty, and wore a size eleven shoe.\n\nHis face was very long, his eyes pouched, rather inclined to redness,\nwhich gave him the mien of a very old and very wise bloodhound. His\nalmost yellow hair grew without much opposition from the barber, and he\nwore a derby hat of a decided green tinge.\n\nFerdinand P. Putney was the lawyer of Lost Hills town. The folks of Lost\nHills were not given to carrying their troubles to the law; so one\nlawyer was enough. Ferdinand had been many things in his forty years of\nlife, but that has nothing to do with the fact that he had studied\nlaw--a little.\n\nAnd there was another rather prominent man in Lost Hills, whose name was\nAmos K. Weed. Amos was the cashier of the Lost Hills bank, mate of his\nown soul, (Ferdinand P. Putney was the captain) and a bottle-drinker\nafter working hours.\n\nAmos was a scrawny individual, five feet six inches tall, with a high,\nwide forehead, pinched nose, beady eyes and long, slender fingers. His\nshoulders were slightly stooped and he shuffled when he walked. Amos\u2019\nlife consisted mostly of looking up and down a column of figures.\n\nBut for many years Amos had dreamed of being a great criminal, a master\nmind; of smashing through things like a Springfield bullet. But his .22\ncaliber soul had held him back. Amos usually figured out a perfect\ncrime, dreamed that he was about to be hung, and discarded the plan.\n\nOn this certain day Amos closed the bank at a few minutes after three\no\u2019clock. He carried his hat in his hand, and his breathing was slightly\nirregular. He fairly slunk away from the bank, shuffling his feet\nsoftly, as though afraid his departure might be heard.\n\nHe covered the half-block to Ferdinand P. Putney\u2019s office in record\ntime, and found the lawyer at his desk, tilted back in a chair, his big\nfeet atop a pile of dusty books on the desk. Amos slammed the door\nbehind him and stood there, panting heavily. Ferdinand shifted his gaze\nfrom the book, which he had been reading, and looked reprovingly upon\nAmos.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d queried Ferdinand softly.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d squeaked Amos. It is likely he intended to thunder, but Amos\u2019\nvocal cords were all of the E-string variety. He came closer to the\nlawyer, his Adam\u2019s-apple doing a series of convulsive leaps, as though\ntrying to break its bounds.\n\nFerdinand closed the book and waited expectantly for Amos to go further\nin his conversation, which he did as soon as he had calmed his jerking\nthroat.\n\n\u201cPutney!\u201d he squeaked. \u201cWe\u2019re ruined!\u201d\n\nFerdinand Putney slowly lowered his big feet, placed the book on the\ntable and stood up.\n\n\u201cThis?\u201d he said huskily, \u201cis terrible. Just how are we ruined, Amos?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey--they didn\u2019t strike oil!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Ferdinand stared at Amos.\n\n\u201cYou mean--_you_ didn\u2019t strike oil?\u201d\n\n\u201cUs! You got me into it, Putney! You know darn well you did. You advised\nme to soak every cent I could get my hands onto in that Panhandle oil\nfield. You did! You did! You did! You----\u201d\n\nFerdinand got into the spirit of the chant and began beating time on the\ndesk-top.\n\n\u201cAnd so you did, eh?\u201d said Ferdinand. \u201cHow much, Amos?\u201d\n\n\u201cFuf--forty thousand dollars!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had that much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI--I didn\u2019t!\u201d Amos\u2019 voice went so high it almost failed to register.\nThen he whispered, running back down the scale. \u201cIt was the bank money.\u201d\n\n\u201cMm-m-m-hah,\u201d Ferdinand nodded slowly, wisely. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a hell\nof a time keeping you out of jail, Amos.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re as guilty as I am,\u201d shrilled Amos.\n\nFerdinand shook his head. \u201cNo lawyer was ever put in jail for giving\nwrong advice, Amos. But I\u2019ll do my best to defend you as soon as they\nput you in jail.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou--you wanted your cut out of it,\u201d choked Amos. \u201cThat was the\nagreement. You hinted that I might take a few dollars from the bank. I\nbought a third interest in a well, and they never struck oil. I\u2019ll tell\n\u2019em--the law--that you helped me; that you advised me to steal from the\nbank; that you--you----\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you keep on talking that way, Amos, I won\u2019t defend you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefend me? You talk like I was already arrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt probably won\u2019t be long, Amos. Are you sure they\u2019ll miss it?\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss it? There\u2019s only ten thousand in the bank right now, and the bank\nexaminer is due almost any day.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018We are lost, the captain shouted, as he staggered down the stairs,\u2019\u201d\nquoted Ferdinand. \u201cThat\u2019s worse than I anticipated, Amos. You have\npractically looted the organization, and the Lost Hills depositors are\nnot the kind that----\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that all by heart!\u201d wailed Amos. \u201cThey\u2019ll hang me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there is still ten thousand dollars in the bank,\u201d mused Ferdinand.\n\u201cDoes Jim Eyton suspect you?\u201d\n\nEyton was the president of the bank, a big, bluff sort of a person, who\ntrusted Amos implicitly.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d moaned Amos.\n\n\u201cHm-m-m-m,\u201d said Ferdinand judiciously. He rested his head on one hand,\nthinking deeply.\n\nAnd as he racked his brain for a solution out of the difficulty, a man\ncame down the wooden sidewalk, bareheaded, his sleeves rolled to his\nelbow. It was Miles Rooney, the editor of the Lost Hills _Clarion_, a\nweekly effort, seven-eighths syndicate matter and one-eighth sarcastic\neditorial.\n\nHe was a living example of the fact that the Lost Hills _Clarion_ was\nnot a paying proposition. His sparse hair stood straight up in the\nbreeze and in one bony hand he clutched a piece of paper.\n\n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d he demanded, handing the paper to Ferdinand. \u201cI\nask you, Putney.\u201d\n\nPutney read the paper slowly. It said:\n\n    Editor of Clarion: I ben redin what you sed about me and i\n    want you to no your a lier and it aint so ive all way had a\n    firs clas repitashun amung men and i aint no menis to no\n    budy and nothin like it and im goin to maik you wish you\n    keep your damn nose out of my bisnes.\n\n                                     y\u2019rs respy   Cloudy McGee.\n\nPutney placed the paper on his desk and squinted at the editor.\n\n\u201cYou wrote an editorial on Cloudy McGee, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know him, Mr. Rooney?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not,\u201d Mr. Rooney flapped his arms dismally. \u201cI don\u2019t need to know\na man of his reputation in order to flay him in print, Mr. Putney.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a bad egg,\u201d put in Amos.\n\n\u201cBad?\u201d Putney lifted his brows. \u201cHe\u2019d just as soon kill you as to look\nat you. If I was running a newspaper, I\u2019d either say nice things about a\nkiller, or I\u2019d say nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat satisfaction is your opinion to me?\u201d demanded the harassed editor.\n\u201cHow can we stop him from coming here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe?\u201d Putney shook his head. \u201cHe has nothing against me. I have never\nseen the man in my life. This is a case for the sheriff--not an\nattorney.\u201d\n\n\u201cSheriff!\u201d The editor spat angrily. \u201cHe and I do not speak. I wrote an\neditorial about the inefficiency of our sheriff\u2019s office, and----\u201d\n\n\u201cNow he won\u2019t help you save your life, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt amounts to that, Mr. Putney.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might apologize to Cloudy McGee, Mr. Rooney.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might!\u201d snapped Mr. Rooney. \u201cBut when Cloudy McGee meets me, will he\nwait long enough to let me do it? The man has a terrible reputation.\nWhy, there\u2019s a thousand dollars reward for him. Will a man of his type\nbe satisfied with an apology?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would establish a precedent,\u201d murmured Putney. \u201cStill, there is only\none thing for you to do and that is to wait and see. McGee is a bank\nrobber, I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to that letter, he will be here soon. If I were in your\nplace, I would shut up shop and go away for a vacation.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t we get out a restraining order, Mr. Putney?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we could do that. But it is not likely that the sheriff would\nserve it. Would you know Cloudy McGee if you saw him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all. No one in Lost Hills has ever seen him.\u201d\n\n\u201cMcGee is a gambler,\u201d remarked Amos Weed, who remembered seeing a\ngeneral description of McGee on a reward notice. \u201cThey say he\u2019ll bet on\nanything. You might make him a gambling proposition, Rooney.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet him that he can\u2019t hit me three times out of four eh?\u201d retorted\nRooney, as he picked up his letter and went away. Putney knitted his\nbrows, as in deep thought, while Amos Weed gnawed a finger-nail.\nSuddenly the lawyer got an inspiration. He leaned across the desk so\nsuddenly that Amos almost bit his entire nail off.\n\n\u201cWatch for McGee!\u201d snapped Putney. \u201cYou\u2019re in a bad fix, Amos. You might\nas well die for a goat as a lamb. You say there is ten thousand dollars\nleft in the bank--in cash. All right. What do I get for my scheme?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor your scheme? Tell it to me, Putney.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a fifty-fifty basis, Amos. If you win, I get half.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I lose?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already lost, you poor egg.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d eagerly. \u201cFifty-fifty, Putney.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bet, Amos. How soon will the bank examiner come?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s due any old time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. Cloudy McGee is also coming--to kill Miles Rooney. You see\nMcGee before he kills Rooney. Not that we care what he does to Rooney,\nyou understand; but he must postpone it.\n\n\u201cMcGee is our meat. Watch for him, Amos. And as soon as you see him,\nbring him to me. But do this secretly. If there\u2019s any killing going\non--remember I\u2019m a lawyer, not a target.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no target either,\u201d declared Amos. \u201cI don\u2019t know Cloudy McGee, but\nI\u2019ll do my best. You\u2019ve got to get me out of this. I took your advice\nonce--and lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a cinch,\u201d assured Putney. \u201cJust let me get at McGee.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwenty miles south of Lost Hills was the town of Salt Wells, from which\nplace a stage line ran to Lost Hills. In a dingy little room at Salt\nWells\u2019 only hotel, two men sat at a table playing poker. It was early in\nthe evening, and both men were too interested in the game to light a\nlamp.\n\nOne man was tall and lean, with deep-set eyes and a long, damp-looking\nnose. He breathed through his mouth, and regularly he wiped a long,\ngnarled finger across his nose, in lieu of a handkerchief.\n\nThe other man was also fairly tall, but not so thin. His face was also\ntanned, but his fingers were more nimble with the cards. He seemed\ngreatly amused over his good luck. On the table between them was a\ncartridge-belt and holstered Colt six-shooter, and a scattering of\ncurrency.\n\nThe man with the bothersome nose spread his hand, his watery eyes\ntriumphant. But the other man spread his hand, and without a word he\npicked up the belt, gun and money.\n\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d asked the winner.\n\n\u201cNobe,\u201d The other man got heavily to his feet. \u201cI\u2019be cleaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, pardner. It was a good game eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood gabe for you.\u201d\n\nThe winner smiled and left the room, a huge sombrero, with an ornate\nsilver band, tilted rakishly over one eye. The loser looked gloomily\nafter him, flirting a forefinger across his nose. He dug in a pocket and\ntook out several little bottles and boxes, which he studied closely.\nEach and every one was a guaranteed cure for colds.\n\nHe selected a tablet from each receptacle, put them in his big mouth and\ntook a big drink from a broken-handle pitcher. Then he put on a derby\nhat, yanked it down around his ears, and went heavily down the hall and\ninto the street.\n\nFor several moments he stood on the wooden sidewalk, looking up and down\nthe street, before crossing to the Road Runner saloon, where he leaned\nagainst the bar. The sleepy-eyed bartender shuffled around behind the\nbar and waited for the order.\n\n\u201cRog and rye,\u201d thickly.\n\nThe bartender placed the bottle and glasses on the bar and watched the\nman toss off a full glass of the sweet whisky.\n\n\u201cYo\u2019re the only man I ever seen that drank rock and rye all the time,\u201d\nobserved the bartender. \u201cGot a cold?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hab. It\u2019s killid be by idches--dab id!\u201d\n\nHe sneezed violently, clinging to the bar with both hands. When he\nlooked up there was a great fear in his eyes.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019tcha take somethin\u2019 for it?\u201d asked the bartender.\n\n\u201cTake sobedig? I\u2019ve tried id all.\u201d He shivered, and poured out another\ndrink.\n\n\u201cHad it long?\u201d\n\n\u201cNod this wod. Sobe day I\u2019ll ged pneumodia and die--dab id.\u201d\n\n\u201cA feller don\u2019t last long when he gets that,\u201d declared the bartender\nhollowly. The sufferer shook his head, shivered and sneezed.\n\n\u201cYou ought to take care of yourself, pardner.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo use,\u201d wearily. \u201cI\u2019be fought id all by life. It\u2019ll ged be sobe\nday--dab it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt kinda takes the joy out of life, when yuh know darn well it\u2019ll get\nyuh in the end,\u201d sympathized the bartender.\n\n\u201cPneumodia is bad,\u201d nodded the man tearfully. \u201cShuds off your wid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019tcha see a doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cNobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cScared?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhad you don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurd yuh.\u201d He poured out another drink of\nsweet whisky, shuddered violently, ran a finger across his nose and\nbuttoned up his collar.\n\n\u201cHow far is id to Lost Hills?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout twenty miles north of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThang yuh.\u201d\n\nThe man with the pneumonia complex went out into the night and\napproached a hitch-rack, where several riding horse-were tied. After\nlooking them over he selected a tall sorrel. Loosening the cinch, he\nremoved the blanket, mounted and rode north, wearing the blanket around\nhis shoulders, holding it tightly around his throat. He sneezed several\nlimes, as though bidding Salt Wells good-by, and faded away in the\ndarkness.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmos Weed was not to be caught napping. There were not many strangers\never seen in Lost Hills, but Amos spotted one that night. He was rather\ntall, slender, but was not dressed conspicuously. Amos dogged him from\nplace to place, wondering if this could possibly be Cloudy McGee.\n\nThe stranger went from game to game in the War Path saloon, showing only\na mild interest in the gambling. He picked up a billiard cue and spent\nan hour or so knocking the balls about the old pool table, paying no\nattention to anyone, while Amos humped in a chair, watching him closely.\n\nHe followed the stranger to the Chinese restaurant and watched him. This\nman wore no gun in sight. He seemed of a serious disposition, ate\nheartily, which was something Amos had been unable to do since he had\nheard of the well failure. He knew it must be a failure, when they did\nnot strike oil within the four thousand foot depth.\n\nThe stranger left the restaurant and sauntered around the street, with\nAmos following him at a distance. Miles Rooney was getting out his\nweekly edition, and several interested folks were watching the flat\nprinting press through the _Clarion_ window. The stranger stopped and\nwatched the operation.\n\nAmos came in beside him, also watching the operation.\n\n\u201cPretty slick, the way it prints \u2019em, eh?\u201d said the cashier. The\nstranger nodded.\n\n\u201cStranger in Lost Hills?\u201d asked Amos.\n\nThe man nodded quickly. \u201cJust came in today.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing to stay with us a while?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. At least, not long.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrummer?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo-o-o-o. Bank examiner.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Amos dropped the subject and got away as fast as possible. This\nwas terrible, he thought. If the bank examiner was in town, tomorrow his\ntheft would be discovered. Amos felt of the knot which was already\ngalling his left ear.\n\nThen he galloped down to Putney\u2019s house, almost fell in through the\nfront door, and blurted out the news.\n\n\u201cI tell you, we\u2019re sunk, Putney!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are, you mean,\u201d indignantly.\n\n\u201cO-o-o-o-oh, hell!\u201d wailed Amos. \u201cI might as well blow out my brains, I\nsuppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Putney judiciously, \u201cit might save complications. Might be\nsafer to shoot the examiner.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t shoot straight, Put! You sure advised me into a lot of\nmisery. What\u2019ll I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive yourself up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd get hung?\u201d\n\n\u201cStart running.\u201d\n\n\u201cRun where? I haven\u2019t got enough money to make a getaway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can shoot straight enough to kill yourself, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re a hell of a lawyer! Didn\u2019t you ever give any good advice to\nanybody?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t a point of law, Amos--this is emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. You sure are good in emergencies. Give up, run, or shoot\nmyself. Any damn fool could give that advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen keep on looking for Cloudy McGee. That\u2019s your last chance. He\nmight show up, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere there\u2019s life there\u2019s hope,\u201d sighed Amos. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. In the\nmeantime, you think of something, Put.\u201d Amos went back to the street,\nhoping against hope.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmos Weed was the first one to spot the stranger with the big hat and\nthe silver-studded hat-band. He remembered that the reward notice had\nmentioned the fact that Cloudy McGee wore that kind of a hat. Amos was\nboth frightened and thrilled. He saw the stranger go into the War Path\nsaloon; so he went to the hitch-rack and looked at the stranger\u2019s horse.\n\nOn the back of the saddle cantle was the single initial M, in a silver\nletter. M must stand for McGee, reasoned Amos. He rather thrilled at the\nthoughts of meeting a man like Cloudy McGee, who flaunted his big hat\nand an initialed saddle before all the sheriffs, who would be only too\nglad of a chance to gather him in and collect the thousand dollar\nreward.\n\nAmos sauntered back to the saloon door, and met the stranger, who was\njust coming out. He glanced sharply at Amos and started across the\nstreet, with Amos trotting at his heels. The man stopped and looked at\nAmos. It was dark out there, and Amos\u2019 knees smote together, but he\nsummoned up his remaining nerve.\n\n\u201cMr. McGee, can I talk with you for a minute?\u201d he said.\n\nThe tall stranger started slightly. \u201cWhat about?\u201d\n\n\u201cBusiness,\u201d Amos swallowed heavily. \u201cBut not here in the street,\u201d he\nhastened to say. \u201cNobody knows who you are, except me. But you shouldn\u2019t\nwear that big hat, you know.\u201d It pleased Amos to give advice to Cloudy\nMcGee.\n\nBut McGee didn\u2019t seem to mind. He waited for Amos Weed to continue.\n\n\u201cYou follow me,\u201d said Amos. \u201cI want you to meet a friend of mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a moment,\u201d said Cloudy McGee. \u201cWhat\u2019s the game?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe game,\u201d said Amos nervously, \u201cis to make some easy money for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy money, eh? Say, I don\u2019t believe I know you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d quavered Amos. \u201cI\u2019m cashier of the Lost Hills bank.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. All right.\u201d\n\nThey went to the sidewalk and headed down the street to where Ferdinand\nP. Putney kept bachelor hall in a little two-room building, just off the\nstreet, on the south end of town.\n\nIt was a great thrill for Amos, to walk with Cloudy McGee, on whose head\nwas a thousand dollars reward. Cloudy stopped to light a cigarette, and\nAmos shivered as the match illuminated McGee\u2019s ornate sombrero. Amos was\nafraid that Jim Potter, the sheriff, might see him.\n\nA man was coming up the street toward them, but Amos did not know who it\nwas. The man watched Amos and Cloudy McGee go in the front door of\nFerdinand P. Putney\u2019s home. Against the lamplight it was easy for this\nman to see the huge sombrero.\n\nThe man sneezed several times, cleared his throat raspingly and walked\nover toward Putney\u2019s front door. It was the man who had stolen the horse\nin Salt Wells. He had ridden almost to Lost Hills and turned the horse\nloose, not wishing to be arrested for horse stealing.\n\nFerdinand P. Putney drew up three chairs, after shaking hands with\nCloudy McGee.\n\n\u201cI--we were looking for you, Mr. McGee,\u201d said Putney. \u201cMr. Rooney, the\neditor of the Lost Hills _Clarion_, said you were coming to--er--see him\nsoon.\u201d\n\nCloudy McGee nodded indifferently, and Amos mentally decided that the\nkilling of an editor was merely an incident in the life of such a man as\nCloudy McGee.\n\n\u201cYou are a man of action,\u201d said Putney, looking upon McGee with\nconsiderable favor. \u201cWhat would you do for a thousand dollars?\u201d\n\nMcGee grinned. \u201cAll depends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to lay my cards on the table,\u201d said Putney. \u201cA man of your\ncaliber appreciates honesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch is my reputation,\u201d nodded McGee.\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Putney stretched out his legs and squinted at Amos, who was\nnot at ease. \u201cOur friend here, is cashier of the Lost Hills bank. Some\ntime ago he stumbled upon a flattering oil proposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t lie about it, Put,\u201d wailed Amos. \u201cYou advised me to put\nevery cent----\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you will pardon me, I will tell Mr. McGee the story, Amos.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t leave yourself out, Putney.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I said before, Mr. Weed saw the possibilities of this investment,\nand, not having sufficient funds of his own, he took forty thousand of\nthe bank money, in order to take a third interest in the Panhandle\nNumber 7 well, a Texas oil company. It promised enormous returns. Today\nhe received a communication to the effect that at a depth of four\nthousand feet, they have struck nothing. The average depth of that field\nis much less.\n\n\u201cIt puts my friend in a bad position. The depositors of this bank are\nnot of a forgiving nature, and in the event of an embezzlement it is\ndoubtful whether the law would ever have a chance to pronounce sentence\nupon Amos Weed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d lynch him, eh?\u201d asked Cloudy McGee heartlessly.\n\nAmos shivered.\n\n\u201cI am doing my best to save my friend\u2019s life,\u201d continued Putney. \u201cThe\nforty thousand is gone. And the only way we can explain the loss is to\nhave the bank robbed. You know how to do things like that, Mr. McGee.\nThere is already a thousand dollar reward for your arrest; so another\nrobbery won\u2019t make much difference to you one way or the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d queried McGee thoughtfully. \u201cHow much do I get?\u201d\n\nFerdinand P. Putney did some mental arithmetic. He knew there was ten\nthousand dollars in the bank. It would be just as simple to make this a\nfifty thousand dollar robbery as a forty thousand dollar robbery--and\nthere would be ten thousand to split between himself and Amos.\n\n\u201cSuppose,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we give you a thousand dollars. You don\u2019t need\nto pull off a regular robbery; just come in the front door, fire a few\nshots, run out the back door, get on your horse and beat it. As you go\nthrough we\u2019ll hand you the one thousand.\u201d\n\nMcGee shook his head quickly. \u201cYou might hand me a package of nails.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I see. You think we might not hand you the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe a fool if you did, Putney.\u201d\n\nPutney turned his head and considered Amos.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d wailed Amos. \u201cI\u2019ve got no thousand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s no lie,\u201d Putney turned again to McGee.\n\n\u201cHow do I know you\u2019d do the job?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t. But you\u2019ve got to take some risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI take plenty, don\u2019t you think? I\u2019ve got to outrun the sheriff.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d nodded Putney. He turned to Amos. \u201cIf I give Mr. McGee a\nthousand dollars, you\u2019ve got to make good with me, Amos.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d whispered Amos. \u201cAll I want is to get out of this mess.\u201d\n\nFerdinand P. Putney went into the next room. He did not trust the bank,\nbecause he knew Amos Weed too well. In a few moments he came back,\ncarrying a thousand dollars in currency, which he counted out to Cloudy\nMcGee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m banking on your honesty,\u201d said Putney. McGee pocketed the bills.\n\n\u201cNo one can ever say I was crooked in business,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen is this\ndeal to be pulled off?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow morning at exactly ten o\u2019clock. There hasn\u2019t been a customer\nin that bank at ten o\u2019clock for months. Am I right, Amos?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d whined Amos. \u201cNobody ever comes in that early.\u201d\n\nCloudy McGee shook hands with them on the deal and left the house,\npromising Amos Weed to keep his big sombrero out of sight.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d sighed Amos, \u201cthat\u2019s settled. If the sheriff does kill Cloudy\nMcGee, he won\u2019t squeal on us, Putney.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe better not,\u201d grinned Putney. \u201cBut the deal ain\u2019t all finished, Amos.\nYou go down to the bank and take out every cent of that ten thousand\ndollars. Nobody is goin\u2019 to wonder if you go in there this time of\nnight, because you often work late.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou--you mean I\u2019m to swipe that money, Putney?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing. We split it two ways--I take six thousand and you take\nfour.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw-w-w-w-w, what kind of a split is that? We were to go fifty-fifty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I get a commission for putting the deal over, don\u2019t\nI? That thousand I gave him, I gave for you. It was just a loan, Amos.\nTake it or leave it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, I\u2019ll take it, Putney. I hope he don\u2019t fall down on the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a heaven-sent angel, Amos. Now, you go and get that money and\nbring it up here.\u201d\n\nAmos went, but he went reluctantly. As he left the house he did not know\nhe was being followed by the wet-nosed stranger, who had listened, with\nan ear glued to one of Putney\u2019s window panes.\n\nIt was not difficult for Amos to enter the bank and come out with the\nmoney. At that time of night there were very few people on the streets\nof Lost Hills. He had the money in a gunnysack and carried it concealed\nas much as possible with his coat.\n\nHe came down the sidewalk, past the doorway of an old shack, when a big\nman pounced upon him, forcibly took the sack away from him, and sent him\nspinning with a punch on the jaw. Amos saw stars that the Lick\nObservatory had never dreamed of seeing, and when he awoke he was all\nalone and very sad.\n\nConscious of the fact that he had been robbed and knocked out, he\nstaggered to Putney\u2019s place, fell inside the house and gasped out his\nstory. Putney\u2019s consternation and wrath knew no bounds.\n\nHe fairly danced in his anger, while little Amos held his jaw and stared\nred-eyed at the wall.\n\n\u201cCloudy McGee double-crossed us!\u201d swore Putney. \u201cHe knew we\u2019d do this,\nthe dirty pup. Well,\u201d Putney waved his arms in desperation, \u201cwe\u2019ll have\nto kill McGee and get that money.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do it,\u201d said Amos wearily. \u201cYou can have my part of it. My Lord,\nthat man is strong!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you see where it puts us?\u201d wailed Putney. \u201cHe\u2019s got all the\nmoney--eleven thousand. He don\u2019t have to rob the bank now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he swore he\u2019d do it, Putney,\u201d Amos grasped at any old straw. \u201cHe\ndidn\u2019t promise not to rob us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you can get any satisfaction out of that,\u201d said Putney.\n\u201cAnyway, it leaves me holding the sack. I\u2019ve got nothing to gain, even\nif he keeps his word. I\u2019m out a thousand. All it\u2019ll do is to save your\nhide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that enough, Putney?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t give a thousand dollars for you, guts, feathers and all.\nI\u2019ve sure bought something--I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw-w-w-w, it may turn out all right, Putney. Look at the jaw I\u2019ve got\non me, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care anything about your jaw Go on home. When he robs that\nbank. I\u2019m going to--\u201d Putney hesitated.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my business. Now go home.\u201d Amos went. And as he hurried home he\nnoticed a light in the living-room of the sheriff\u2019s home.\n\nPerhaps at any other time Amos would not have given this a thought, but\njust now his nerves were in such a state that everything looked\nsuspicious.\n\nThe big stranger with the damp nose had engaged a room at a little\nhotel, left his bundle there and gone to the War Path saloon, where he\ngot into a poker game. In a little while Cloudy McGee came in, bought a\ndrink and tackled the roulette wheel.\n\nSeveral times the damp-nosed stranger glanced at Cloudy and found him\nlooking. The first time they nodded, but the other glances were of\nsuspicion instead of friendship.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bad cold, stranger,\u201d observed the dealer.\n\n\u201cYea-a-ah--dab id.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to take something for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hab,\u201d the stranger swallowed heavily.\n\n\u201c\u2019F I was you I\u2019d see a doctor,\u201d declared one of the players. \u201cI had a\nfriend that died from pneumonia. Started just like your cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thig I\u2019ll see a doctor in the mornig--dab id.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmos Weed slept little that night, and he got up in the morning with his\nnerves all frazzled out. He did not eat any breakfast. He had heard of\ncondemned criminals eating a hearty breakfast just before their walk to\nthe gallows, and the very thought of food sickened him.\n\nAs he walked toward the bank he met the damp-nosed stranger, with the\nderby hat crushed down over his head. He sneezed just before they met,\nand Amos jerked as though someone had fired a gun.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lookig for the doctor,\u201d said the big man thickly.\n\nAmos sighed visibly and audibly, as he pointed out the doctor\u2019s\nresidence.\n\n\u201cThag yuh,\u201d nodded the sufferer, and went on. Amos looked after him,\nwondering who he was, and then went on to the bank. It was about ten\nminutes of ten, when Amos opened the doors and went in, closing them\nbehind him. The bank did not open until ten o\u2019clock.\n\nAmos looked out the front windows, his heart pounding against his ribs.\nIt was within ten minutes of the time that would see him saved or sunk.\nHe went to the rear door, throwing back the heavy bolts, which would\ngive Cloudy McGee a chance to make his getaway, if he were still going\nto carry out his plan.\n\nA glance showed that McGee\u2019s horse was behind the bank. Amos Weed\u2019s\nhopes arose like a well-filled balloon. At least Cloudy McGee was\nshooting square. Then he saw Ferdinand P. Putney coming down the alley\nbehind the street, carrying a double-barrel shotgun. Amos closed the\ndoor, peeking through a crack, watching Putney, who came in behind the\nbank.\n\nHe looked all around. A huge packing case and several smaller boxes gave\nhim a hiding place, into which he crawled. Amos drew away from the door,\nhis eyes squinting painfully. It was evident to him that Ferdinand P.\nintended to intercept Cloudy McGee and try to get back his money.\n\nAnd Amos realized that Putney was going to ruin the whole scheme. If\nCloudy was forced to stop and argue the case with Putney, it would give\nthe sheriff time to catch him, and then there would be no chance to\nprove that McGee had stolen the fifty thousand.\n\nSomeone was knocking on the front door! Amos trotted to the front. It\nwas the depot agent. He showed Amos a telegraph envelope through the\nglass of the door.\n\nAmos went to the door, shaking like a Hula dancer, and got the message.\nIt was for him. He jigged back to the rear door and looked out. Then he\nalmost swooned. Seated on the boxes, where Ferdinand P. Putney was\nconcealed, was the sheriff, Big Jim Potter, smoking his pipe.\n\nAmos staggered back to the front door. Seated on the sidewalk across the\nstreet was \u201cSlim\u201d Caldwell, the deputy sheriff, watching the bank front.\nAmos reeled. The clock was striking the hour, and at every chime Amos\nWeed jerked inside his clothes.\n\nThen he unlocked the door and went drunkenly toward his desk, where he\nslumped in a chair, staring with unseeing eyes. The door opened and a\nman came toward him. He opened his eyes. It was the man he had directed\nto the doctor\u2019s office. Amos shook his head wearily. Nothing mattered\nnow. He was still holding the telegram, and now he opened it\nmechanically, his eyes scanning it quickly. It read:\n\n    PANHANDLE NUMBER SEVEN BRINGS IN GUSHER AT FORTY TWENTY\n    FIVE STOP CONGRATULATIONS\n\n                                     GRIMES SUPERINTENDENT.\n\nAmos fell back in his chair, the world reeling around him. He opened his\neyes. The stranger with the cold had crouched back against the wall, a\ngun in his hand, as Cloudy McGee came in through the doorway. Slim\nCaldwell, the deputy sheriff, was running across the street, almost to\nthe door, when the stranger behind it flung up his gun, covering McGee.\n\n\u201cPut \u2019em up, McGee!\u201d he snapped, and McGee\u2019s hands went up, a look of\nwonder on his face.\n\nSlim Caldwell ran in behind him, and the gun covered both of them.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the damp-nosed stranger of Caldwell.\n\n\u201cDeputy sheriff,\u201d blurted Caldwell.\n\n\u201cAll right. Handcuff that man.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut--but--\u201d stammered the deputy.\n\nThe sheriff was coming in the back door, herding Ferdinand P. Putney\nahead of him. He stared at the tableau. The damp-nosed stranger swung\nhis back against the wall, half-facing the sheriff. For several moments\nthings were rather deadlocked.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the stranger with the cold.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the sheriff!\u201d snapped Jim Potter.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got you, Cloudy McGee!\u201d snorted Caldwell addressing the\ndamp-nosed stranger, and covering him. \u201cDrop that gun!\u201d\n\nThe man addressed dropped his gun and Caldwell picked it up, but before\nanyone could stop him, the damp-nosed man had made a sudden dive and\nknocked the original McGee off his feet, and was sitting on him.\n\n\u201cFor heck\u2019s sake, what\u2019s this all about?\u201d demanded the sheriff, coming\ntoward them, still clinging to Ferdinand P. Putney.\n\n\u201cPud ha\u2019d-cuffs on him, I tell you!\u201d snapped the damp-nosed man. \u201cThis\nis Cloudy McGee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYo\u2019re crazy!\u201d roared the sheriff. \u201cYo\u2019re McGee yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thig so?\u201d The damp-nosed man turned back the lapel of his soiled\nvest and showed them the badge of a deputy U. S. marshal. \u201cBy nabe is\nMorton,\u201d he said thickly. \u201cI hobe you\u2019re sadisfied.\u201d\n\n\u201cU. S. marshal?\u201d blurted the sheriff.\n\n\u201cYeah. I be been looking for Cloudy McGee, bud I didn\u2019t hab much of a\ndescribtion, excebt that he gambles quite a lot and is about my size. I\nheard he was in Salt Wells, or aroud that part of the country.\n\n\u201cI med this sud-of-a-gud and he wod my horse, saddle, hat and my gud. I\nthought he\u2019d stay there bud he left; so I stole a horse and followed\nhim. I heard hib frame up to rob this bank. They called hib McGee. That\nfeller over there,\u201d pointing at Amos, who was almost in a state of\ncollapse, \u201ctook ted thousad from the bank last night; so I toog it away\nfrob him. It\u2019s ub in by roob.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, for the land\u2019s sake!\u201d blurted the man upon whom the deputy\nmarshal sat. \u201cThey mistook me for Cloudy McGee, and I let the sheriff in\non the deal. I thought you was McGee, because they recognized me by that\nbig hat which I won away from you at Salt Wells, and we framed it to get\nPutney, Weed and you this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs thad so?\u201d The marshal wiped his nose and stared down at the man\nunder him. \u201cWho in hell are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? I\u2019m the bank examiner.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh! Loogs like a mistage--dab id.\u201d\n\nThe officer got to his feet, grinning widely.\n\nAmos was coming toward them, holding out the telegram.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll deed it to the bank,\u201d he quavered. \u201cIt\u2019s a gusher, and they\u2019re\nworth more than fifty thousand dollars. Just so they don\u2019t hang me, I\u2019ll\nagree to anything.\u201d\n\nThe bank examiner shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s between you and the bank\nofficials, you cheap little crook.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheap?\u201d muttered Ferdinand P. Putney. \u201cThat man must deal in big money,\nif he calls a fifty-thousand steal cheap.\u201d\n\nThe bank examiner took a roll of bills from his pocket and handed them\nto the sheriff.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the retaining fee I got from Putney last night. If you want to\nprosecute him, that is evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno what I want to do,\u201d said the sheriff blankly.\n\nAn apparition was coming in through the back door; a gobby-black sort of\na person, painted up like a war-path Indian in reds, greens, blues,\npurples and black. They watched him come toward them.\n\n\u201cMy Gawd!\u201d blurted the sheriff. \u201cIt\u2019s Miles Rooney!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d wailed the editor. \u201cLook at me! He tied me to my own press and\npainted me with my own inks. I\u2019ve been like this all night. I just got\nloose!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho painted you?\u201d whispered Amos.\n\nMiles Rooney turned his ink smeared countenance upon the luckless\ncashier, pointing a gobby finger at him accusingly.\n\n\u201cYour friend. The man I seen you standing outside my window with last\nnight. The man you were talking to, darn you! Cloudy McGee!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bank examiner!\u201d exploded Amos. \u201cHe--he said he was.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d said the sheriff. \u201cHe\u2019s examined a lot of \u2019em.\u201d\n\nThe real bank examiner and the marshal walked outside, halting on the\nedge of the sidewalk, where they grinned at each other.\n\n\u201cYou ought to take something for that cold,\u201d said the examiner. \u201cThe\nfirst thing you know you\u2019ll be having pneumonia.\u201d\n\n\u201cDod be.\u201d The officer shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t scare be do more. All\nby life I\u2019be been scared of pneumonia. Never had the nerve to visit a\ndoctor. Bud I seen one today. Ha, ha, ha, ha! Fuddy, ain\u2019t id? I feel\ntwedy years you\u2019ger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he say was the matter with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHay fever.\u201d",
