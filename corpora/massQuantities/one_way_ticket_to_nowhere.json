And it\nwas up to Jeff Blake to find out where it had gone...]\n\n\n\"Jeff Blake!\" Holly O'Toole's knotted hand reached out and grasped the\nright hand of the passenger descending from the rocket transport. \"This\nis a hell of a night to come home, when a man's been away as long as you\nhave.\"\n\nJeff Blake laughed, and swung down to his side to stand on the wind- and\nrain-swept dock. He towered above O'Toole, lanky and smooth skinned. His\nface was tanned a deep brown from space travel and little wrinkles\ncurled out from the corners of his mouth. Wrinkles that indicated a\nwilling smile. There was a cheerful warmth of sincerity in his voice.\n\n\"Weather doesn't seem to bother me much any more. I've been in and out\nof a lot of it. This rain isn't much compared to those space turn-overs\nwe've had around moon the last few weeks.\"\n\nThey walked together toward the lighted office. Once inside, Holly\nO'Toole tossed his coat across the warm elector-rad heater and turned\nadmiring eyes on Jeff Blake's tall frame.\n\n\"They sure made a man of you in space service,\" he said. \"The last time\nyou left Hope you were a half-baked kid with a yen for a ray gun.\"\n\nO'Toole sat back comfortably as Blake removed his jacket and threw it\nover the heater. Blake was hard, and yet as Holly watched him, there\nseemed to be a touch of softness in his eyes that hadn't been there when\nBlake was a kid. A little more of Wade Blake, maybe. When two men were\nborn identical twins, they were bound together in a lot of odd little\nways.\n\nThe faintest suggestion of a bitter smile started across Jeff Blake's\nyoung face. Then he relaxed, sat down. Lighting a cigarette he sucked\ndeeply and let the smoke drift from his lips.\n\n\"The last time I saw you, O'Toole, you were a little red-headed Irishman\nwho stirred up more trouble than my brother and I could get out of in a\nmonth. What is it now?\"\n\nHolly O'Toole's dark face grew concerned. At once Blake knew his trip\nwould be interesting. Knew that the trouble he had been expecting was\nclose at hand.\n\n\"It's your brother, Wade,\" O'Toole went on. \"Wade's in hot water again,\nand he's in over his head.\"\n\nThat same sardonic smile flitted across Blake's face, and faded\nimmediately. O'Toole was under a terrific strain. The man was only\nforty-five, yet the once brilliant battle flag of red hair had grown\nthin in spots. His eyes, once clear and snapping, were a washed-out\nblue.\n\n\"Go on,\" Blake said kindly. \"When I got your message it wasn't easy to\ndrop everything and come. I expected something like this.\"\n\nO'Toole stared at him, hating to say what he knew he had to.\n\n\"Wade is planning to marry Dauna Ferrell.\"\n\n\"Dauna?\" Blake was plainly puzzled. \"Why, Dauna was a tow-headed brat\nwhen I left Earth. But if Wade wants her, why not?\"\n\nO'Toole shook his head a little impatiently.\n\n\"It isn't that he wants her,\" he said. \"I can't explain everything now.\nLet's just say that Wade is giving up every chance he'll ever have of\nowning the 'Hope to Horn' line. He's stirring up trouble between Dauna\nand her father and making a dangerous ass of himself in the bargain.\"\n\n\n\nBlake flicked the long ash from his cigarette.\n\n\"He must be a busy man,\" he admitted. \"But where do I fit into this\npuzzle?\"\n\nHolly O'Toole was plainly bewildered.\n\n\"I wish I knew,\" he admitted. \"I can't handle every angle alone, and if\nsome changes don't come in a hurry, Wade, Dauna and Walter Ferrell will\nlose everything they have, including their sanity. You're the only man\nwho can pound any brains into Wade's head. I figured you might be\nwilling to try it, before it's too late.\"\n\nHe stood up rather stiffly, drew his belt up over his rounded paunch.\nBlake watched him with narrowed, speculative eyes. O'Toole looked at his\nwatch.\n\n\"Where is Wade now?\" Blake asked.\n\n\"At South Station since last night,\" O'Toole said.\n\n\"Does he know I'm on Earth?\"\n\nO'Toole looked doubtful.\n\n\"I'm afraid he does,\" he admitted. \"I sent your radio-wave last week and\nhe was in the office at the time. I can't explain why, but I have the\nfeeling he checked up after I left and found out who I had radioed.\"\n\nBlake followed O'Toole to the door, drew on his heavy coat.\n\n\"Let's get it over with,\" he shrugged his shoulders. \"I've had to take\nWade in hand a couple of times. Once more won't do any harm. We'll go to\nSouth Station.\"\n\nO'Toole hesitated. He had something else to get off his chest.\n\n\"Jeff,\" he spoke gravely. \"It's only fair to tell you that being Wade's\ntwin may get you into some pretty heavy trouble.\"\n\nJeff grinned queerly.\n\n\"Good!\" he said. \"I sort of like the stuff.\"\n\nThe door slammed behind them and the light from the single window faded\nagainst the dark field.\n\n\n\nA swift shadow of a man darted from between the empty space docks. The\nstranger's arm went high and jerked straight. A wicked knife flicked\nfrom the steeled fingers. It missed Blake's neck by inches; struck the\nheavy door behind him. Blake took two swift steps forward, realized the\nman was already lost in the night. He stopped and pivoted. O'Toole had\nalready jerked the knife from the door, was staring at it with tight\nlips.\n\n\"Playful bunch of goons you've got around here,\" Blake said mirthlessly.\n\n\"I'm afraid that's some of the trouble I mentioned,\" O'Toole replied. \"I\ntold you Wade is stirring up a pack of trouble and I'm afraid you're\ndropping right into the middle of it.\"\n\nHe held the knife out toward Blake and the younger man took it.\n\n\"My brother must have changed a lot since I saw him last. Ten years ago\nhe spent most of his time playing the violin and raising flowers.\"\n\n\"Still does,\" O'Toole answered in a far-off voice. \"But he has a few\nother hobbies now. Games that he's learned to play too well for his own\ngood.\"\n\nBlake was studying the knife that had missed his head. He ran a thumb\nlightly over the razor edge of the weapon.\n\n\"Games that you play with knives?\"\n\nO'Toole nodded.\n\n\"Unless I'm greatly mistaken,\" he answered grimly. \"That nice little\nfellow who tossed the bread knife at you is one of Grudge Harror's play\nboys.\"\n\n\"Now,\" Blake said, \"we're getting some place. Who is Grudge Harror and\nwhat's he got against Wade?\"\n\n\"I'll try to tell you what I know of Harror while we're on our way to\nmake that next mono-train,\" O'Toole said. He took another quick glance\nat his watch. \"She pulls out in half an hour, so keep away from lights\nand let's get to the station before we miss her.\"\n\n\n\nThey went out of the fenced space-field, bending double against the\nstorm. For several minutes O'Toole led Jeff Blake through deserted\nstreets. Reaching the lighted dome that was the Hope Mono-Terminal, he\nexplained.\n\n\"Grudge Harror,\" he said, \"is the leader of a gang of cut-throats who\nhave been holding up and wrecking trains from here to the border. He's\ngot Walter Ferrell on the verge of bankruptcy. If something doesn't\nhappen soon to stop him, the Hope to Horn[A] line will fold up like a\nbusted space-kite.\"\n\n\"And Wade?\" Blake questioned. \"Where does he fit in the picture?\"\n\n\"Ferrell depended on Wade to track Harror down and tear his gang apart.\nYou mentioned that Wade liked to raise flowers. Well! Thus far, he's\nstill at it. So for six months Harror has torn the business apart, train\nby train.\"\n\nBlake looked through the great entrance into the warmly lighted\nMono-Terminal. It was nearly deserted.\n\n\"It's a rotten shame that a cheap bunch of punks have spoiled a business\nas fine as Walter Ferrell's mono line,\" he said slowly. \"It looks as\nthough he has picked the wrong man for the job of getting Grudge Harror.\nMaybe we can do something about it.\"\n\nHolly O'Toole whacked him heartily across the back.\n\n\"I knew you'd say that, Jeff.\" Something of the old fight was coming\nback into the Irishman's eyes. \"I'll admit I'm stumped, but maybe with\nyour help....\"\n\n\n\nThe mammoth dome of Hope's mono terminal was glowing warmly under a\nrainbow of fluorescent light, when Blake and O'Toole entered the\nrotunda. Crowds jostled toward the open gates that led to the V-Gaps\nthat held the single-tracked mono train upright when they were at the\nstation docks.\n\nThey followed down the long ramp to the dock and waited. A mono train\nscraped slowly around the V-Gap and stopped. On its blunt, plastic nose\na single numeral was printed--6. The train was decorated in a sleek\ncontrast of silver and brown. Inside, porters rushed about making the\ntrain ready for its return trip south.\n\nOnce on board, Blake stretched out and relaxed into deep air cushions.\n\n\"It's a good feeling to have some luxury again,\" he admitted. He lighted\na cigarette from his crushed package and O'Toole accepted another. They\nwatched quietly as a few despondent looking passengers filed in and sat\ndown. A tense undercurrent of feeling was at once evident to Blake's\nkeen eye. These travelers were here because of necessity. Not for their\nown pleasure.\n\nHe was totally unprepared for what happened in the next ten minutes. A\ngirl came in. Before Blake could register surprise, she had uttered a\nlittle cry of joy, plunked her smart little body down at his side and\nthrown her arms around his neck.\n\n\"Oh! Darling! This is a surprise.\" He felt rich, warm lips press tightly\nto his own, brown eyes staring lovingly into his.\n\nSuddenly the eyes widened in surprised horror and she stiffened. Her\nfingers went limp against his neck. Her lips tightened. She jumped up\nand sank limply into the chair opposite him.\n\n\"Oh!\" She blushed profusely. \"Oh! Heavens, I thought....\"\n\nBlake's face burned. Blood rushed to his cheeks and emotions he hadn't\nfelt for years came rushing back into his body.\n\n\"I--I didn't expect....\" he started.\n\nThe girl had collected her wits.\n\n\"I'm--I'm sorry,\" she said. \"You look so much like someone I know....\"\n\nBlake looked her over quickly, and decided she was the most attractive,\nclean cut young thing he had ever seen. She was dressed in sleek brown\ntraveling clothes. A pert, tight-fitting hat allowed the wealth of\nshining brown hair to escape its edges and flow down the straight,\nsmoothly-molded shoulders. Her lips were still slightly curved in that\nattractive oval of dismay.\n\n\"Do you always kiss strange men who look like people you know,\" he\nasked, and immediately realized he was being cruel. \"Forgive me, it\n_was_ unexpected.\"\n\nA look of recognition flooded her face.\n\n\"You must be Jeff Blake!\" She stood up and clasped his hand warmly. \"If\nit weren't for that coat of space tan, I'd have sworn you were Wade.\"\n\n\"Dauna Ferrell,\" he said with a gasp. \"Golly, but you've grown up since\nI saw you last.\"\n\nHer face turned a lovely pink.\n\n\"You won't have a very nice opinion of me after what I did?\"\n\n\"Forget it.\" He leaned forward. \"I've heard you're in love with Wade. If\nI was fortunate enough for only that one kiss, to take Wade's place with\nso beautiful a young lady, my life is one kiss richer than I deserve.\"\n\n\"I _do_ love Wade,\" she said. \"But if his brother insists on throwing\nsuch compliments at me, I'm sure he's going to be fine for my spirit.\nThank you, sir.\"\n\n\n\nHer eyes traveled suddenly beyond him, toward the car entrance. Blake\nturned and his face lighted at the sight of the tall, elderly man coming\ntoward them. Walter Ferrell had aged since he last saw him, but the\nsnow-white head, slim waist and wiry legs were the same. Ferrell came\nforward, a look of cold hostility in his eyes. Then he recognized the\neasy figure slouched in the chair opposite his daughter. A keen smile\nlighted his features.\n\n\"Jeff Blake!\" His hand shot out. \"My God, boy, you're good to look at.\"\n\nBlake was on his feet, one hand in Ferrell's, the other on the older\nman's shoulder.\n\n\"And you!\" he said. \"The man who went to riches while I was kicking\naround as a space tramp in every port of the universe.\"\n\nDauna moved gracefully, swiftly to her father's side.\n\n\"Tell Dad how I greeted you,\" she blushed prettily. \"Dad, I think Jeff\nhad better go back to the moon. He and Wade will be quarreling over me\nif I go on acting the same way I started out today.\"\n\nFerrell paid no attention to Dauna's outburst. Yet, the mention of\nWade's name sent smouldering fires into his eyes. He changed the subject\nabruptly. Drawing Blake down to the chair beside him he said.\n\n\"Tell me boy, what's happened since you left? I want to hear the whole\nstory.\"\n\nBlake talked. As he related the story of his past ten years away from\nearth, he watched O'Toole and Dauna, seated together a few seats away.\nThey were discussing Wade, he knew. Although he talked with Walter\nFerrell, Blake's thoughts were with O'Toole, Wade and the girl, Dauna.\n\n\"Walter,\" he asked suddenly. \"What's wrong with Wade? Has he been in\ntrouble?\"\n\nFerrell tipped a tired head back against the cushion of his chair.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said slowly. \"At least, nothing I can put my finger on.\"\n\n\"Then,\" Blake insisted, \"from what O'Toole says, you've both been pretty\ntough on him. That is, if you're telling me the truth.\"\n\n\"Damn it, Blake,\" Ferrell exploded. \"When I say nothing, I mean we\nhaven't caught him violating any laws. It's--well, I just never had any\nadmiration for Wade. He's what the younger generation would call a cream\npuff. Soft, flabby and a mind that refuses to grasp any problem fitted\nto a man of his age.\"\n\nBlake stared out the window, waiting. The mono had pulled out of Hope.\nOutside nothing was visible in the night except an occasional jagged\npeak outlined against a cloudy sky. Troubled by Ferrell's continued\nsilence, he turned again to his friend.\n\n\n\n\"You haven't told me much,\" he protested. \"O'Toole called me home\nbecause he thought important things were going to take place. He thinks\nI ought to knock Wade around a little, but I've got to know why.\"\n\nFerrell swore softly.\n\n\"O'Toole is always sticking his neck out where it gets clipped every now\nand then. He's a swell Irishman, but his mountains are actually mole\nhills.\"\n\nBlake nodded and said covertly, \"Someone tried to heave a knife into me\nat the space-port. Was that one of O'Toole's mole hills?\"\n\nFerrell's body jerked upright, and the muscles in his face stood out\ntautly.\n\n\"The hell you say!\"\n\n\"Truth--ask O'Toole.\"\n\nBlake's voice died. His eyes turned to slits. The coach door had opened\nquickly and a man had stepped inside. He was dressed from head to foot\nin skin-tight black leather. His eyes were covered with a flashing,\nsilvery mask. Blake's gaze was on the small, ugly electro-gun in the\nbandit's hand.\n\n\"A visitor,\" Blake said laconically. At the same time he pushed his feet\nfar back under the chair and braced them, like bent springs.\n\nThe masked man crouched at the waist and the gun whipped around,\ncovering the few passengers in the car.\n\n\"Stand up--all of you.\" He spoke harshly and with deadly precision. \"On\nyour feet, and make it fast.\"\n\nBlake waited. A low monotone of voices protested, died out to a whisper\nof fear, and the passengers, including Ferrell stood with arms raised.\n\nThe electro gun came around slowly toward Blake.\n\n\"Up on your corns,\" the bandit spat at him. His eyes were black, diamond\nslits in the silver mask.\n\nBlake's gaze never wavered. Silver Mask came toward him slowly.\n\n\"You heard me.\"\n\nA scorching flame seared Blake's cheek as the electro gun exploded and\npart of its force burned his skin. Blake's face whitened with rage and\nhe dove desperately forward. Smashing a hard fist into Silver Mask's\nface, he watched the fellow's body go limp. Two swift reflex actions,\none savage and murderously threatening, the other desperately defensive,\nhad brought lightning developments.\n\nBlake heard Dauna scream in terror and turned like a flash. But the\nheavy butt of a new electro gun swept down on his head. There was a\nsudden sickening jolt and bright flashes of light went tearing into his\nbrain. He pitched forward across the first bandit's limp body, and the\ncar, spinning before his eyes, went blank.\n\n\n\nWhen Blake came around, he was stretched out full length on the floor, a\npillow under his head. He looked up into Dauna's eyes.\n\n\"If you're wondering about the silver masked man who struck you,\" she\nsaid, \"There are dozens of them on the train. They have us all under\nguard.\"\n\nHe sat up a little weakly, felt his head clear. Ferrell and O'Toole sat\nacross from his make shift bed.\n\n\"They won't let me make a dash for the door, Jeff,\" O'Toole said in an\nunhappy voice. \"Once in the hall, I could clean up on a snag of those\nblack devils.\"\n\n\"And get your head bashed in, like Jeff did,\" Ferrell added. \"You're\nsitting right here with me, _Mr._ O'Toole until we find out what this is\nall about.\"\n\nFerrell turned to Blake.\n\n\"You asked for trouble, Jeff,\" he said tersely. \"You've got it. These\nare the same Silver Masks that have practically ruined my business.\nLooks as though this might do it. Wade was told to clean out this tribe\nof black devils six months ago. I detailed fifty men to work with him.\nI'll bet you a ten spot that at this moment Wade Blake is at South\nStation watering his flower bed, or some equally insane occupation.\"\n\nDauna was on her feet, arms akimbo, cheeks blazing.\n\n\"That's not fair, Dad,\" she flared. \"He just isn't the type of boy to\nhandle this problem. You saw what happened to Jeff....\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Blake begged. \"O'Toole is all for knocking Wade's head\nagainst his garden wall. Ferrell, you want him to keep us out of trouble\nwhen he's eight thousand miles away, and Dauna is protecting him when\nI'm not altogether sure he deserves it. For the time being let's worry\nabout what is to become of us. Later, there'll be time to fight over\nWade.\"\n\nFerrell looked abashed.\n\n\"You're right,\" he admitted more quietly. \"But you're a better man than\nI am if you can make sense out of this. Why don't they take what they\nwant, kill us and be on their way?\"\n\nBlake looked out of the window. The sky was clear now. The rain had\nstopped and the moon and stars were visible.\n\n\"I think I can answer that,\" he said. \"From my following the stars, we\nare now heading directly east, into the heart of the mountain country.\nIf I'm correct on directions, the monoline runs directly north and\nsouth. Right?\"\n\nO'Toole pushed past him and strained his face to the glass. He turned,\nface shining.\n\n\"By golly,\" he said. \"Jeff's right. We must be flying or something.\nThere isn't any track that's laid in this direction!\"\n\n\n\nFerrell stood at O'Toole's shoulder, looking out into the blackness. He\nturned toward them, face stark with terror.\n\n\"It--can't--be!\" he spoke slowly. \"Vancouver is south of us, and\nyet....\"\n\n\"And yet you're going east.\" The strange voice cut in on them harshly.\n\nBlake wheeled about to face the third Silver Mask he had seen tonight.\nThe man towered above them, a full seven feet tall. His thick lips,\nvisible below the mask, were curved in a cruel, delighted smile.\n\n\"You've bought one way tickets,\" he said gruffly. \"Tickets that will\ntake you--nowhere.\"\n\nContinuing, he turned to Ferrell.\n\n\"Walter Ferrell, and his daughter, Dauna Ferrell. Am I right? We are\nfortunate in picking our company tonight.\"\n\n\"As owner of this rail line,\" Ferrell demanded in an even voice. \"I want\nto know what this is all about. Where are we going?\"\n\nOutside the sounds of the wheels had faded. The train wasn't moving. It\nseemed to tip at a slight angle, as though leaning on some support.\n\n\"My name is Harror,\" Silver Mask said. \"You're not going anywhere for\nthe time being, and while you are here I'll thank you to call me _Mr._\nHarror. Don't try to leave this car. My men are stationed all around the\ntrain with orders to shoot and look afterward. Take a look outside in a\nfew minutes. You may be surprised.\"\n\nHe turned and stooped to go through the door.\n\nBlake turned to Ferrell and O'Toole.\n\n\"I haven't got the drift of all this yet,\" he admitted. \"But we're in\nfor trouble and plenty of it.\"\n\n\n\nBlake was sitting quietly in the smoker, head reclining on the window\nledge, eyes half closed in a cloud of smoke. The girl and her father\nwere asleep. O'Toole pretended to be, but Blake wasn't sure of the\nIrishman. O'Toole slept with one eye open most of the time.\n\nThe deep silence and blackness outside of the window could indicate only\none thing. They were in some sort of a cave. The giant Harror had said\nif they looked out, they might be surprised. Yet, hours had passed, and\nthe place was quiet and black as a tomb.\n\nThe door opened and a newspaper flopped on the floor. Blake went forward\nand picked it up.\n\n\"Thought you'd like to see the big news.\" It was Harror's heavy voice\nrumbling from the doorway. \"Flown in from South Station. We've been\nwaiting to see what reaction the kidnaping of a train might have.\"\n\nBlake listened quietly, and without a word turned on his heel and\nreturned to his chair. The door closed on them again.\n\nBlake glanced at the headline. Then the full significance of Silver\nMask's latest move hit him between the eyes. The headline of the South\nStation Star was in letters six inches high:\n\n                          MONO FLYER MISSING\n\n                    Entire Train Lost Without Trace\n\n     Mono 6, crack flyer of the \"Hope to Horn\" mono line disappeared\n     from the face of the earth tonight. On board were Walter\n     Ferrell, the company's owner, and Dauna, his daughter. At an\n     emergency meeting of the board of directors, it was admitted\n     that not the slightest clue to the train's whereabouts has been\n     discovered.\n\n     Soon after midnight, Mono 6 of the west coast's crack Mono Line\n     left Hope, Alaska. No further reports came after it passed the\n     first five-hundred-mile zone. Reports of a wreck are\n     unconfirmed. A complete search of the track failed to bring to\n     light the slightest hint of the flyer's final resting place.\n\n     In the past few hours the company has faced the problem of\n     handling thousands of tour cancellations. Officials of the line\n     are attempting vainly to allay the fears of both would-be\n     passengers and stockholders. Wade Blake, Vice President of the\n     company had previously ordered an investigation in an attempt\n     to track to earth the series of strange accidents that have\n     followed the Hope to Horn mono line for some months, but cannot\n     be located at present for a statement.\n\nBlake threw the paper on the floor. There was more to the story. Much\nmore. Here in a few columns he had read the final exit of a great\nrailroad line and its owner. Unless Walter Ferrell and Mono 6 could\narrive at South Station, unharmed and within a few hours, the world\nwould refuse to accept further service from the Hope to Horn and\nFerrell's business would be ruined.\n\nThe article said that Wade could not be located. Blake hoped that he had\nbeen close when the train failed to arrive at Vancouver. A momentary\nfrown turned down the corners of his lips. Perhaps Wade wasn't as\nhelpless as they seemed to think. Blake fervently hoped so.\n\n\n\nSince Blake had finished reading the paper, two hours had passed, as\nnearly as he could guess. O'Toole came in from the car's smoking\ncompartment, and sat down wearily across from Blake. He pushed his big\nfeet up on the chair beside Blake.\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" he asked.\n\nBlake pointed to the paper silently and O'Toole picked it up. He read\nquickly, his eyes darting from side to side of the page. His face grew\npurple.\n\n\"They certainly pulled a fast one,\" he growled. \"A whole train missing,\nwith the owner of the line and his daughter on it. I never stopped to\nthink what that might mean when the papers got hold of it.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" Blake admitted. \"But Harror did, and if I'm not mistaken,\nsomeone with a lot more brains than Harror had the same idea. This thing\nwas carefully planned, O'Toole, but there are two points that the Silver\nMasks overlooked.\"\n\nO'Toole looked at him questioningly.\n\n\"One was they didn't expect you and me to cause the trouble we're going\nto,\" Blake went on, \"and the other is Wade. He's around somewhere. He\nmay help us out at the right time.\"\n\nO'Toole spat disgustedly.\n\n\"_We_ can cause trouble if we ever get out of here,\" he admitted. \"I'm\nnot so sure of Wade.\"\n\nA shaft of light cut in through the window suddenly, blinding them both.\n\nThey stared out with wide eyes. A murmur of voices from the car told\nthem that the others were awake, and also impressed by what they saw.\n\nMono 6 was in a great cavern. Great black granite walls towered high\nabove. The mono train had evidently entered the cave slowly and slipped\nbetween a long row of huge boulders that held it upright. The cave was a\ngraveyard of mono cars. They lay across the full width of its floor,\ndismantled and torn apart for whatever value they had to offer.\n\nFor the first time Blake realized just how large operations had been;\njust how close the Silver Masks were to ruining the industry Ferrell had\npainstakingly built up.\n\nMen appeared from a long row of doors worked into the cliff side. They\nall looked alike in the black suits and glittering silver masks. Tools\nof every description had made their appearance. Beyond the doors from\nwhence they had come must be a complete set of living quarters with\naccess to the outside world.\n\nCommon sense told Blake that the entrance through which Mono 6 had\narrived was now carefully sealed. If he was to solve the mystery of\nGrudge Harror's plans and make escape possible, it would be necessary to\ngo through those doors. Harror himself was there somewhere, and Blake's\nfists ached to meet the man alone.\n\n\n\n\"My golly,\" O'Toole breathed. \"They all look alike. What you suppose\nthey'll do with us? Must be forty or fifty people on this set of cars.\"\nBlake turned away from the window.\n\n\"If the train were wrecked,\" he said in a matter of fact voice, \"they'd\ntake everything off it and leave it here. With passengers on board, they\nhave to remove the baggage and movable parts. After that....\"\n\n\"After that, we'll all go to hell the fastest way,\" O'Toole said with\ngrim lips. \"Let's get something started. I can't sit still until they\ndecide what to do with us.\"\n\n\"If I'm not mistaken,\" Blake said grimly, \"they have us all disposed of\nwell in advance. You mentioned just one thing that may help us out.\"\n\n\"If I did,\" O'Toole admitted, \"It was just crazy luck.\"\n\n\"They all look alike.\" Blake stood up, studied O'Toole carefully, and\nsaid. \"We're going to join the gang of the Silver Masks.\"\n\nO'Toole grinned.\n\n\"Just like that,\" he said dryly. \"And this guy Harror is going to shake\nour hands and say, 'Glad to see you're with us, boys.'\"\n\nBlake was already out of the smoking lounge. He went toward the end of\nthe car with a swift, determined stride. Ferrell and Dauna had been at\nthe window and as he approached the door leading outside, they turned.\n\n\"Hold it, Jeff,\" Ferrell said. \"You're going to do something foolish and\nI won't have it.\"\n\n\"We've already got ourselves into a pretty foolish mess,\" Blake reminded\nhim almost bitterly. \"If I can do any good by trying, I don't want you\nto interfere. It may be too late.\"\n\nDauna barred his way to the door. Her face was drawn and bloodless.\n\n\"You're going to face that giant, Harror,\" she pleaded haltingly. \"Jeff,\nplease...?\"\n\nHe took her hands in his, and smiled down at her.\n\n\"Wade wouldn't want you to put on a scene,\" he said gently. \"I'm in this\nthing up to my neck. Wade's name and my own are both involved.\"\n\nShe hesitated and stepped away from him. Her arms dropped hopelessly.\n\nO'Toole reached the door with Blake.\n\n\"What are the plans,\" he asked? \"I'm in on them remember.\"\n\n\"Then start howling at the top of your lungs,\" Blake grinned. \"Call\nHarror every name you ever heard of, but remember there are women in the\ncar. We're going to get dragged out of here and have a talk with that\nfreak.\"\n\nO'Toole nodded.\n\n\"Okay!\" he said. \"I get the idea. If we can be bad boys, maybe Harror\nwill spank us himself.\"\n\n\"He'll try,\" Blake answered quietly. \"From then on it will depend on us\nwho does the punishing.\"\n\n\n\nBlake turned to the door and ignoring Dauna, started to pound on it with\nall his strength, O'Toole added his weight to Blake's and they started\nto shout loudly.\n\n\"We want to sock that big goon, Harror,\" O'Toole howled. He turned and\nwinked at Dauna. \"How'm I doing?\" he asked.\n\nDauna smiled gamely.\n\n\"So well, you'll probably be shot at once,\" she said. \"Please Blake, be\ncareful.\"\n\nThey pounded again, harder than ever. The door started to sway and\nbuckle under their weight. There was a heavy step outside, and a murmur\nof angry voices.\n\n\"Shut up in there.\"\n\n\"We want to talk with your boss,\" Blake shouted. \"Let us out or we'll\nclean up on the whole gang of you.\"\n\nThe door swung open, and a guard came in. Two more were close behind.\nGuns swung around, covering the car.\n\n\"You'll talk with Harror,\" the first man said. \"And you'll be damned\nsorry you did.\"\n\nHe pushed a gun into Blake's side.\n\n\"Now walk,\" he ordered. \"And walk straight. No monkey business.\"\n\nO'Toole started to follow them.\n\n\"You're staying here,\" the guard growled. \"This monkey is going to get\nthe business.\"\n\nO'Toole reddened with rage.\n\n\"Why you masked ape,\" he said. \"Let me out of here or I'll push your\nchin into your scalp.\"\n\nThat did the trick. The second guard twisted around and punched O'Toole\nin the face. The Irishman reeled, caught himself and said through bloody\nlips, \"You'll pay for that.\"\n\nThe masked man pushed him from the car and O'Toole went a little\nuncertainly down the steps and after Blake.\n\nThey crossed the floor of the cave toward the series of doors in the\nwall. Two more guards joined the group and they paused before the first\ndoor.\n\n\"We got some wise guys,\" the man who was covering Blake shouted. \"Want\nto give them a going over, Chief?\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence. Then Grudge Harror's heavy voice said\nfrom beyond the door.\n\n\"Bring them in.\"\n\nBlake kicked the door open and strode into a small, mercury-lighted\nroom. There was a single chair and the desk behind which Harror was\nseated. His huge arms rested across its top. His expression darkened as\nhe saw Blake.\n\n\"What's he been up to?\"\n\nThe guard stepped close to Harror and pocketed his weapon.\n\n\"He was shouting his head off,\" he said. Then, in an almost apologetic\nvoice he added, \"The Irishman insisted on coming along.\"\n\n\n\nBlake's eyes were on Harror's face. The giant's fists were clenched, his\nlips tight and cruel. He was searching for something.\n\n\"All right,\" Harror growled finally. \"What's the game?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Blake answered shrewdly. \"We were waiting for you to murder\nus, and got impatient, that's all.\"\n\nTwo of the guards left and Harror swung to his feet. He was leering.\n\nBlake watched the remaining guards from the corner of his eye. O'Toole\nwas still standing quietly by the door, alert and ready. He saw Blake's\neye on his, and winked deliberately. O'Toole, Blake decided, was ready\nany time.\n\n\"You were right on the murder angle,\" Harror admitted. \"Pretty smart,\nain't you?\"\n\n\"About some things,\" Blake admitted. \"I don't fall for everything I read\nin the papers. I know you used a hidden mono track to get us here, and\nthat you'll probably send us back over it into a nice deep canyon, when\nyou have everything you want off the train.\"\n\nHarror leaned over silently and spat into his face. Blake saw red. With\na lightning thrust he smashed the lamp from the table and plunged the\nroom into blackness. From O'Toole's side of the room a ray gun belched\nfire, but Blake was already out of range. He heard a cry of pain and\nrealized that Harror had caught the flame on the arm. Harror, outlined\nin the light of the ray was almost on top of him.\n\nFrom the spot where O'Toole had been, Blake heard a sullen thud and a\nlong groan of pain. Dodging from Harror's plunging fall, Blake knew\nO'Toole was doing his part. He grasped the edge of the table and tried\nto thrust it in front of Harror. The man swore loudly and kicked it\naway. There was a slit of light coming from under the door.\n\nIn its path, Blake saw Harror standing above him, a hairy fist\ndescending like a ton of lead. He twisted his face around, sensed\nHarror's blow miss him by a fraction of an inch. Diving low he hit\nHarror a body blow with his shoulder and the giant doubled in pain.\nBlake swung upward before Harror could regain his balance, and set his\nfist crashing into Harror's face. The giant swung backward like an\nenraged elephant. Two more flashes of electro-fire went spurting over\nhis head and O'Toole started to sing in a loud, off-key voice.\n\n\"Slug 'em,\" O'Toole chanted. \"It's the Irish that are in this mess\ntonight.\"\n\nIn the darkness, Blake grinned painfully. His lip was split and\nbleeding. His arm ached from the forceful contact with Harror's jaw.\n\nAnother guard went down in the scuffle and O'Toole howled his battle cry\nagain.\n\n\n\nHarror was silent. Blake changed his position wearily, waiting for some\nsign. He heard Harror breathing loudly from the far corner. The blow on\nthe face must have dazed him.\n\nBlake closed it slowly, listening to Harror. Waiting for him to strike\nagain. Then two giant arms closed tightly around his chest, cutting off\nhis breath. He tried to shout, but his lips made no sound. He felt\nhimself sinking toward the floor, Harror on top of him. Harror was\nholding on with all his strength.\n\nBlake relaxed slowly, and his head fell to one side. He felt the grip\nrelax just a trifle, and gathered all his remaining strength. With a\nterrific uppercut, Blake's arm shot upward, catching Harror squarely on\nthe chin. There was a sudden snap as the giant's head tipped back as\nthough unhinged. His arms relaxed and Blake fell away from him.\n\nThe Irishman had done his job well. The room was quiet.\n\nThen: \"Jeff, Jeff, are you all right.\"\n\nBlake chuckled.\n\n\"I've got condensed ribs,\" he said. \"But I think Harror will lie still\nfor a while.\"\n\n\"Golly!\" O'Toole sighed in relief. \"You sure had a Goliath on your\nhands. Wish I could have helped you.\"\n\n\"What became of those two guards,\" Jeff asked? \"Seems to me they had you\non the spot for a while.\"\n\n\"Aw!\" O'Toole said. \"I got hold of one of them fire guns and there\nwasn't anything to it.\"\n\nBlake had reached the door to the outer cavern. He opened it a couple of\ninches and looked out. The Silver Mask gang were still working on Mono\n6.\n\nEven as he watched, a man detached himself from the gang at the far end\nof the train and came slowly toward the partially opened door. Blake\njumped back and closed it tightly.\n\n\"Get two of these guards out of their uniforms,\" he said. \"Make it\nquick. We've got more trouble coming.\"\n\n\n\nA quick knock came on the door. Blake said, in a hard voice.\n\n\"Yeah! Who is it?\"\n\n\"Slater,\" was the reply. \"Tell the boss we got the train cleaned out.\nWe're all ready to set it loose.\"\n\nIn the light of the open door, Blake looked at O'Toole. The Irishman was\nalready in one of the Silver Mask uniforms. His face was hidden and he\nlooked like one of the gang.\n\n\"Tell him the boss will be all set in a minute,\" Blake said. \"I've got\nto get into one of these outfits.\"\n\nO'Toole flung the door open wider and pushed the bodies of the silent\nguards out of sight.\n\n\"We'll be out in a minute,\" he said to Slater. \"Get her ready to roll.\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" Slater answered him respectfully. \"The cab is all fixed, and\nthe motors are turning. The hidden door has been opened so we better\nmake it snappy.\"\n\nO'Toole nodded.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"Make sure you don't leave anything on board that's\nuseful. And Slater....\"\n\nThe man had turned. Now he hesitated and turned back.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Harror is staying here,\" O'Toole said quickly. \"He ain't feeling so\ngood. Says I'm to give the orders.\"\n\nSlater laughed.\n\n\"That's a good one,\" he chuckled. \"How long since that gorilla started\ngiving orders around here.\"\n\nStill laughing, he turned and went back toward the waiting masked men.\n\nO'Toole closed the door and ripped the mask away.\n\n\"This is it,\" he said quickly. \"I knew Wade was mixed up in this\nbusiness. Harror isn't the real boss here.\"\n\nBlake was half way into a uniform of the Silver Masks. He finished his\njob before answering. Then he spoke.\n\n\"I know you and Ferrell hate Wade's guts,\" he said slowly, \"but....\"\n\n\"It's not me so much,\" O'Toole protested. \"Ferrell said long ago that\nWade was in this mess. He didn't seem to get any action on the case. Now\nwith the guy Slater saying Harror isn't the boss, there isn't any other\nanswer.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sorry, O'Toole,\" Blake said. \"I should be willing to admit that Wade's\nour man. I don't know why I can't. It's just that blood is pretty thick\nstuff, I guess. It's hard to think your own brother would turn on you\nlike this.\"\n\nO'Toole lowered his head.\n\n\"We've got to do something,\" he said quietly. \"Those guys won't sit out\nthere waiting forever.\"\n\nBlake stood up slowly.\n\n\"Supposing Wade isn't the chief,\" he asked. \"What then?\"\n\n\"They'll kill us all, just as they already plan to,\" O'Toole groaned.\n\"We might as well take a flying chance.\"\n\nBlake shook his head.\n\n\"I've got a better idea,\" he said.\n\n\"Then spill it. We haven't much time.\"\n\n\"To begin with,\" Blake said. \"If Wade was in this he'd have shown up\nhere long ago. The paper said he couldn't be located. I'd recognize my\ntwin even in one of these outfits.\"\n\nO'Toole protested.\n\n\"Then who is the chief? He's here somewhere and Slater sure didn't\nintend to take orders from Harror.\"\n\n\"He must be on the train,\" Blake answered.\n\n\"Now you're crazy,\" O'Toole answered savagely. \"The people on Mono 6\nhave been locked up for hours. If the leader of the Silver Masks was\namong them he'd have taken charge hours ago.\"\n\n\"Unless,\" Blake said thoughtfully, \"he didn't want any of us to _know_\nhe was the leader.\"\n\nO'Toole pulled the mask down over his eyes.\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" he said. \"You've got something up your sleeve\nand I'll play the cards the way you want them.\"\n\n\"One more thing,\" Blake told him. \"These men had to have a track to get\nMono 6 into this cave. When it goes out again we'll be on the same\ntrack, but it will end in a canyon or deep lake.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well! We've got to get started on that trip. After we are out you and I\nwill have to take our chances of stopping the mono.\"\n\n\"And I thought Grudge Harror was a tough baby,\" O'Toole grinned.\n\n\n\n\"It isn't a matter of being tough,\" Blake said. \"Can you handle the\nengine room alone?\"\n\n\"Handled it for years,\" O'Toole said coolly. \"But I'd like to know where\nthat track ends.\"\n\n\"You will.\" Blake went toward the door. He gripped O'Toole's shoulder.\n\"You're a good Irishman, O'Toole. Now go out of here and straight to the\ncab. I don't think they'll dare send one of the other men. If the\ncontrols are tied into place, leave them alone. When I signal, set all\nmotors going full speed. Sit tight and keep her flying.\"\n\n\"And the end of the track?\" O'Toole asked. \"If I don't get shot in the\nback before I'm half way across the cave, how do I know when to stop?\"\n\nBlake chuckled dryly.\n\n\"Perhaps you won't,\" he admitted. \"But I'll be in the rear lounge with\nevery male passenger within my sight. One of them is bound to break down\nwhen he knows he's at the end of the trail.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"I'll jerk the emergency cord,\" Blake said. \"Set your brakes the minute\nyou hear it. O'Toole, it's a long chance but we've got to take it.\"\n\n\"One more thing,\" O'Toole asked. \"Blake, who in hell is the leader of\nthe Silver Masks?\"\n\nBlake hesitated, his face darkening. He opened the door and pushed\nO'Toole out gently.\n\n\"If I'm not mistaken,\" he whispered evenly, \"Walter Ferrell knows more\nabout this than he's telling.\"\n\n\n\nThe gang of Silver Masks were gathered around the front end of Mono 6 as\nHolly O'Toole and Jeff Blake emerged from Harror's office. They walked\nswiftly toward the cab, and Slater who had evidently been waiting,\nstepped from the crowd and came toward them.\n\n\"How about it?\" He addressed Holly O'Toole, as O'Toole seemed to be\nleading Blake. \"Everything has been stripped from the baggage cars.\nShe's ready for her trip into the lake.\"\n\n\"Okay!\" O'Toole mumbled. He turned to Blake. \"Take two men and get all\nthe passengers into the lounge car.\"\n\nBlake's heart was pounding wildly. If O'Toole slipped now, they'd all\npay for it. He turned toward the crowd of waiting masked men.\n\n\"Two of you guys step out,\" he ordered. \"Open the doors and herd those\ncattle into the last car back.\"\n\nThey obeyed him instantly. In five minutes every man and woman in the\nflyer were crowded into the car with Walter Ferrell and Dauna. O'Toole\nhesitated, started to climb into the cab of Mono 6, and Slater stopped\nhim.\n\nStanding a few feet away, Blake heard them mumble something. O'Toole\npointed to Blake.\n\n\"I'll see that she gets clear of the cave,\" he said in a loud voice.\n\"The boss wants him to be in the car until it's started and on the way\ndown.\"\n\nSlater hesitated, nodded and turned away. O'Toole winked and Blake\ngrinned back at him. The Irishman had done a swell job. This was one\nnight when his blarney had been a blessing.\n\nWhen Jeff Blake went into the lounge car, he drew his electro gun. The\ncar was full of frightened women and angry men. He was afraid they might\nturn on him in the Silver Mask, and spoil his plans. Slater had followed\nhim to the door.\n\n\"Don't stick too long,\" the man cautioned him. \"You'll be doing a\nhundred miles an hour before you hit the head end of the valley. The\nboss is going to jump when he leaves the cave.\"\n\nThe boss? Then O'Toole really had done a good job. Automatically Blake\nlooked toward Walter Ferrell, and noticed that he was of the same build\nand size as O'Toole. Slater couldn't see the occupants of the car, but\nhe guessed who Blake was staring at.\n\n\"Take good care of Ferrell,\" Slater said in a dry whisper. \"He's worth a\nlot of money to us.\"\n\nBlake grinned.\n\n\"_Don't worry_,\" he said. \"_I'll take good care of him._\"\n\n\n\nMono 6 started to glide smoothly back out of the cave. Somewhere out of\nsight behind the flyer, a huge door opened in the side of the mountain\nand screeched its way into the concealed slit above. The train gathered\nspeed swiftly, and the moon suddenly appeared from nowhere. Blake\nwaited, made sure there were no guards remaining on board. Then he ran\nswiftly toward the group around Ferrell. He ripped the mask off as he\nmoved, and Dauna, her eyes glued to his face, gasped in happy surprise.\n\n\"Jeff,\" she ran toward him, \"Oh! Jeff, I'm so glad.\"\n\nHe pressed his lips to hers quickly, turned away without a word and\nfaced Walter Ferrell. Ferrell's face was expressionless, frightened.\n\n\"_Jeff Blake_,\" he said. \"How did you make it?\"\n\n\"There isn't time to talk now,\" Blake answered quickly. \"O'Toole and I\novercame Harror. We managed to get them to start Mono 6 out of the cave.\nO'Toole is in the cab now. In a few minutes we'll be free. Before they\nwake up to the trick we played on them we'll be five hundred miles\naway.\"\n\nFerrell's face relaxed. Although Blake watched him closely, the man\nshowed no sign of alarm.\n\n\"Good work, boy.\" His hand gripped Blake's shoulder. \"I don't know how\nyou did it, but there'll be a big reward for you when we reach South\nStation.\"\n\nBlake sat down opposite him. His eyes never left Ferrell's face. Yet,\nFerrell held himself remarkably in reserve.\n\n\"I did it more for Dauna than anyone else,\" Blake admitted slowly. \"We\nwouldn't have anything happen to her would we?\"\n\nFerrell turned toward his daughter.\n\n\"I've been pretty hard on my girl,\" he said. \"But if she hadn't got out\nsafely I'd have torn that place apart with my bare hands.\"\n\n_He meant every word of it._ Blake's body tensed. The full shock of what\nFerrell's words meant was sinking slowly into his brain. Suddenly he\nshot to his feet.\n\n\"I've been a fool,\" he said. \"A damned, blind fool!\"\n\n\"A fool?\" There was no mistaking Walter Ferrell's bewilderment.\n\nBlake was already at the car door.\n\n\"I'm going to take a long chance,\" he shouted back. \"Ferrell, you crowd\nthe passengers into both halls at the ends of the car. Open the outer\ndoors. If the train goes into the lake, try to get as many out as you\ncan.\"\n\n\n\nWith the shouts of alarm still ringing in his ears, Blake went swiftly\nthrough the long empty cars toward the cab. The train was backing\nthrough the night now at a terrific speed, and the black forest flashed\npast him as he went to his appointment with Holly O'Toole.\n\nBlake reached the head car, tried the door and stepped back in alarm. It\nwas locked. He looked overhead and found the tiny emergency entrance to\nthe catwalk above. Back inside, he dragged several chairs out quickly,\nclimbed them and pushed upward. Luckily the door was open. Head and\nshoulders above the train, he stopped. The wind pushed him back,\nclutching at his breath. He climbed out on the catwalk slowly, crouching\nto the smoothness of the plastic, and wriggled ahead.\n\nThe diesel room was below him now. Its top door opened easy. He\nlistened. All motors were purring smoothly. The hot smell of oil drifted\nup. Ahead, the cab was silent.\n\nHe pushed his feet down cautiously and dropped. His feet hit the oily\nfloor and he fell flat. The door to the cab was open. He went toward it,\nsaw lights over the dash and ran to the main control stick. It was\nlashed firmly in place with heavy chain.\n\nThe speed indicator was pointing to four hundred miles per hour. Swiftly\nhe released the chain, and felt the control lever break loose, falling\ninto neutral. Blake reached for the magnetic brake, and heard a footstep\non the floor behind. He whirled swiftly. O'Toole was standing at the\nentrance of the diesel room, electro gun pointing at Blake's chest.\n\n\"You're a smart one,\" O'Toole said. He waved the gun meaningly. \"I'm\nglad you cut the power. We'll coast from here to the lake.\"\n\nBlake was silent.\n\n\"Thought Walter Ferrell was the chief of this outfit, did you?\" O'Toole\nwas enjoying himself. \"Well, I didn't have any idea of jumping the\ntrain. We'll coast within a mile of the cut, shoot the coupling free\nbetween the cab and the coaches, and set our brakes. Walter Ferrell and\nhis little party are going to taste cold water for the last time.\"\n\nBlake said nothing. He started to walk deliberately toward the hulking\nIrishman. O'Toole snarled.\n\n\"Back,\" he warned. \"I've got to kill you anyhow. It might as well be\nnow.\" Blake grinned.\n\n\"I can't understand why you ever included me in this set-up to begin\nwith,\" he said. \"Things would have been easier if you hadn't sent for\nme.\"\n\n\"Listen Blake, when I sent for you, I figured you'd fit in here. I\ndidn't know you'd fall for all this kid brother heroic stuff.\"\n\n\n\n\"You evidently knew something of my history,\" Blake said coolly. \"Why\ndid you play that sympathetic game?\"\n\nO'Toole seemed anxious to be understood.\n\n\"I knew you had been pirating every space craft between here and Mars,\"\nhe said. \"I knew that you had a swell reputation and were clever as\nhell. I knew that if you'd see things my way, I could get Walter Ferrell\nin bankruptcy within a month, and cut you in as a partner.\"\n\n\"Why change your mind?\" Blake asked. He sat down in the pilot's chair\nand crossed his legs comfortably. \"All we have to do is cut that\ncoupling loose, ride back to the cave and collect all the dough we need\nby sitting tight.\"\n\nO'Toole chuckled.\n\n\"Do you take me for a fool? I can handle things my own way, with Ferrell\nout of the way. I don't need you.\" His face softened a bit, and the gun\ndropped inches. \"Besides, how do I know you won't turn yellow and give\nthe whole thing away?\"\n\nBlake saw his chance to hit at O'Toole's one weakness.\n\n\"Wade is out of the way,\" he said swiftly. \"I can return to South\nStation and assume control of the line with Ferrell out of the picture.\nYou'll get half of everything we make.\"\n\nO'Toole was weakening. He glanced out of the cab, toward the wooded side\nof the valley.\n\n\"You're just crooked enough to be on the level,\" he pocketed the electro\ngun. \"In ten minutes we'll reach Loon Lake. Better get to that\ncoupling.\"\n\nBlake followed him back through the power car.\n\nO'Toole turned once, and grinned wickedly.\n\n\"We'll have a devil of a time, you and I,\" he said. \"Now, for a nice\nswimming party to Ferrell and his gang.\"\n\nHe hunched down over the coupling that separated the power units from\nthe line of coaches. The simple coupling adjustment was under his\ndoubled fist. Blake's eyes narrowed as the coupling started to come\nloose under the Irishman's grip. He lifted his heavy boot, and silently\nbrought it down on O'Toole's head.\n\nThe blow was executed coolly and without feeling. No quarter had been\nasked, and there was no pity in Blake's eyes as Holly O'Toole fell\nforward, face down. He lay still, arms outstretched over the slit\nbetween the cars. Blake pushed him forward, and saw the body drop\nquickly out of sight to the rail.\n\n\n\nHe turned toward the cab and with feverish haste jerked down all three\nmagnetic brake levers. Mono 6 shuddered through its entire length and\nseemed to settle backward against the screaming, protesting track. The\nflyer halted slowly, skidding sickeningly. Then outside, with the\nshrieking brakes silenced, Jeff could hear the soft lapping of water.\n\nHe rushed to the open window and looked down. They were on a long wharf,\nextending out over dark water. He looked back along the line of cars,\nshining faintly in the moonlight. A sigh of relief escaped his lips.\nMono 6 was still on the rail. A scant three hundred feet beyond the last\ncar was open water.\n\nA shout of alarm came from somewhere back in the corridor of the car.\nBlake turned away from the window and went toward the coaches. At the\ndoor to the power room he stopped. Dauna Ferrell, her face flushed with\nrelief came to him. He took her in his arms and held her close. He\nkissed her roughly, trying to make up for the loneliness and heartbreak\nhe had caused.\n\nWalter Ferrell was behind them.\n\n\"I hate to intrude,\" his face was bathed in a happy smile, \"but wherever\nWade is, I'm sure he wouldn't approve of his brother making love to my\ndaughter, even if Jeff is somewhat of a hero right now.\"\n\nDauna released her hold on Blake's neck, and turned to her father.\nBlake's arms went around her waist and drew her close to him. She leaned\nher soft, curly head against his neck.\n\n\"Dad,\" she said, \"brace yourself for an awful shock.\"\n\nFerrell laughed aloud.\n\n\"I know,\" he said. \"You've given up Wade and are going to marry Jeff\nBlake instead.\"\n\nDauna half turned, and nuzzled her chin in Blake's brown neck.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I'm going to marry Wade anyhow.\"\n\nFerrell was bewildered.\n\n\"But I don't see....\" he stuttered.\n\n\"It's going to be confusing,\" Dauna told him. \"But, try to understand.\nJeff Blake, the _real_ Jeff I mean, was killed a month ago, while\nholding up a space ship near Mars.\"\n\nFerrell acted for a moment as though he were going to faint. Then he got\ncontrol over himself. He stared at Blake with unbelieving eyes.\n\n\"_Then--you're--Wade...!_\"\n\n\n\nBlake nodded.\n\n\"I couldn't seem to get a line on this Silver Mask gang,\" he admitted\nhesitantly. \"When O'Toole wired Jeff to return I couldn't figure out\nwhy. O'Toole and I have both known that Jeff was a tramp and a space\npirate. I knew one thing that O'Toole didn't. The space authorities\ninformed me a month ago that Jeff was dead. I was suspicious of O'Toole\nfrom the first. I caught a local rocket and boarded the moon liner in\nspace. With some artificial tan, a space uniform and a lot of bluff I\nmanaged to play the part. It fooled everyone but Dauna. She knew almost\nfrom the first, but she kept my secret.\"\n\nWalter Ferrell backed into the lounge car. He sat down abruptly.\n\n\"I know you've done something I never thought possible,\" he admitted.\n\"And to prove my gratitude I'll apologize for everything I've ever said\nagainst Wade Blake. From now on you're half owner of the 'Hope to\nHorn'.\"\n\nWade Blake grinned broadly.\n\n\"Thank you sir,\" he said. \"But I can't accept your offer. If Dauna\nmarries me she's destined to get star dust in her eyes.\"\n\nDauna looked at him worshipingly.\n\n\"In fact she already has flakes of it there now,\" Wade added. \"Space\nofficials have asked me to track down the gang who worked with my\nbrother Jeff. If Dauna will say the word, I'd like to spend our\nhoneymoon on Luna, and then get started on the new job.\"\n\nFerrell sighed deeply.\n\n\"I think Dauna has given her answer already,\" he said softly. \"As for\nme, I'll have to make a public statement, taking back every word about\nWade Blake and his love for flowers and the violin.\"\n\n\"That man Harror said we had a one way ticket to nowhere,\" Dauna said\ndreamily. \"I wonder if we'll ever get there?\"\n\n\"If we do,\" Wade told her, \"I'm sure with you there, it's going to be a\nwonderful place.\"\n\n\n\n[Footnote A: \"Hope to Horn\" was the nickname lovingly applied by its\nloyal employees to the mono railroad developed and owned by Walter\nFerrell. These mono, or single-tracked trains were brought into service\nin 2100. The Hope to Horn line itself consisted of a north- and\nsouth-bound rail of heavy plastic extending from Hope, Alaska to Cape\nHorn, South America.\n\nThey were powered by standard sixteen engine diesels, capable of five\nhundred miles per hour. Built almost in the shape of long graceful fish,\nthe trains were of highly colored plastic. They ran on a single rail of\nplastic-steel.\n\nIn a few short hours men and women tired of business could follow the\nentire Pacific coast line from one end to the other, the entire trip\nconsuming twenty-two running hours between Hope and Cape Horn.\n\nThe plastic rail kept upkeep at a minimum and allowed the use of a\nsimplified signal system in place of earlier complicated switches and\nsignal signs. The track was divided into five-hundred-mile sections.\nEvery two hours a train left one of these sections, or \"blocks.\" In\nleaving, they allowed the plastic to turn green or \"open,\" signaling the\nnext train to depart. As long as the pilot could see green track ahead\nand red behind, he was safe to travel \"on time.\"\n\nGyroscopic balancers, huge head and tail fins, and constantly maintained\nspeeds allowed a mono to travel safely on a single row of centered\nwheels.--ED.]\n\n\n\n\n",
